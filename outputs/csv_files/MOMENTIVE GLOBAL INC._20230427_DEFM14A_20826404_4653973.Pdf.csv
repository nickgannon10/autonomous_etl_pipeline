Effect of the Merger",11,12

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (which we refer to as the “DGCL”), at the effective time of the
merger: (1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Momentive; (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub will cease; and (3) Momentive will continue as the surviving corporation of the merger and as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “surviving corporation” to
refer to Momentive as the surviving corporation following the merger.
As a result of the merger, Momentive will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed,
you will not own any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation as a result of the merger.
The time at which the merger becomes effective (which we refer to as the “effective time of the merger”)
will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub may agree and
specify in the certificate of merger).

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time of the
merger, each share of Momentive common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger (other than excluded shares) will be automatically converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $9.46, without interest less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to
this amount as the “per share price.” By “excluded shares” we mean shares of Momentive common
stock that are (1) held by Momentive as treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; (3) owned by
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger; or (4) held by persons who have (a) neither voted in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement or the merger nor consented thereto in writing; and (b) properly demanded appraisal of
such shares of Momentive common stock pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 262 of the DGCL, if
any.
At or prior to the closing, an amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent that is
sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration to Momentive’s stockholders. Once a stockholder has
provided the payment agent with any documentation required by the payment agent, if any, the payment
agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate per share price in exchange for the
shares of Momentive common stock held by that stockholder. For more information, see the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and
Payment Procedures.”
After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share price for each share of
Momentive common stock that you own, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that
Momentive’s stockholders holding shares with respect to which an appropriate person has properly and
validly exercised and perfected, and has not validly withdrawn or otherwise lost, their appraisal rights will
have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal
proceeding as contemplated by the DGCL, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger-Appraisal Rights”).

Each outstanding Momentive restricted stock unit (which we refer to as a “Momentive RSU”) under the
applicable Company Equity Plan (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) that is vested at the
effective time of the merger (but not yet settled) or that vests as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which we refer to as a “vested Momentive RSU”) will

the total number of shares of Momentive common stock subject to such vested Momentive RSU
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable
withholding taxes.
Each outstanding Momentive RSU under the applicable Company Equity Plan that is not a vested
Momentive RSU (which we refer to as an “unvested Momentive RSU”) will be cancelled and converted
solely into the contingent right to receive from Parent or the surviving corporation an aggregate amount in

will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding unvested
Momentive RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, with payment forfeited to the extent
vesting is not satisfied.

shares of restricted stock that vest immediately prior to or as of the effective time of the merger including as

a “Momentive option”) under the applicable Company Equity Plan that is vested at the effective time of the

When considering the recommendation of the Momentive Board that you vote to approve the proposal to

(3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Momentive’s stockholders, the Momentive
Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other
matters. These interests include the following:
•
For Momentive’s current executive officers, the treatment of their outstanding awards of Momentive
RSUs, Momentive restricted stock, and Momentive options, as described in more detail in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Momentive’s Directors and

If the merger is consummated, Momentive’s stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of capital
stock) who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their
applicable shares of Momentive common stock through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly demand
appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain statutory requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5)
do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of
their shares of Momentive common stock in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL if
certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. This means that these persons will
be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in
cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Momentive common stock, exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger through the date
of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the merger and
the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to persons seeking
appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount
so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest
theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such
voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,
persons who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with
respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of
their shares.
Only a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal
rights, such person must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Momentive before the vote is taken on
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold of record or own beneficially the subject shares of
Momentive common stock through the effective time of the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other
procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Momentive unless certain conditions are satisfied
by the persons seeking appraisal, as described further below. The requirements under Section 262 of the
DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description
is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL. Pursuant to Subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 of the

11TABLE OF CONTENTS
provide Parent, at the effective time of the merger, with an equity investment of approximately $1.17 billion to
fund a portion of the aggregate merger consideration and to pay fees and expenses related to the merger,
subject to the terms and conditions of the equity commitment letter. Momentive is a third party beneficiary of
the equity commitment letter and is entitled to enforce the investment commitment, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein. Additionally, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, the certain lenders (which we refer to as the “debt financing sources”) delivered a
debt commitment letter to Parent dated March 13, 2023, pursuant to which the lenders party to that letter
committed to provide Parent, at the effective time of the merger, with debt financing of $450 million to fund a
portion of the aggregate merger consideration and to refinance Momentive’s existing credit facilities, subject
to the terms and conditions of the debt commitment letter. These financing amounts, together with

Momentive and the members of the Momentive Board, seeking to enjoin the merger and other relief. The
complaints assert claims against all defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder for issuing Momentive’s preliminary proxy statement with allegedly false and
misleading statements of material facts and omissions of material facts against the individual defendants
under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged “control person” liability with respect to such allegedly
false and misleading statements of material facts and omissions of material facts.
The defendants believe that the claims are without merit. For a more detailed description of litigation relating
to the merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Litigation Relating to the
Merger.”

MOMENTIVE GLOBAL INC._20230427_DEFM14A_20826404_4653973.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the
merger agreement, and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions
that are important to you. We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed information contained
elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents
to which we refer in this proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement without charge by following the instructions in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On March 13, 2023, we announced that Momentive entered into the merger agreement. Under the
merger agreement, Parent will acquire Momentive for $9.46 in cash per share of Momentive common
stock (without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes). In order to complete the
merger, Momentive’s stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Momentive common
stock as of the record date must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This
approval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.” The Momentive Board is
furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of Momentive common
stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of Momentive’s stockholders to be voted at the
special meeting.
This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger,
the merger agreement and related agreements and transactions, the special meeting, and the matters
to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your
shares of Momentive common stock without attending the special meeting and to ensure that your
shares of Momentive common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.
Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit
a proxy as soon as possible.
Q:
What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Momentive?
A:
The proposed merger is the acquisition of Momentive by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement is approved by Momentive’s stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger
agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Momentive, with Momentive
continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Momentive will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, and Momentive common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be
delisted from the Nasdaq. In addition, Momentive common stock will be deregistered under the
Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $9.46 in cash, without interest and less
any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Momentive common stock that you own, unless you
have properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the
DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares
of Momentive common stock, you will receive $946 in cash in exchange for your shares of Momentive
common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
How does the per share price compare to the market price of Momentive common stock?
A:
This amount constitutes a premium of approximately 28 percent to the volume weighted average closing
price of Momentive stock for the 10 trading days ending on March 13, 2023, the date the merger
agreement was executed, and a 46 percent premium to the company’s closing stock price on the day
prior to media rumors regarding a potential sale on October 19, 2022.
20TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What will happen to restricted stock, Momentive RSUs, Momentive restricted stock and
Momentive options? 
A:
Generally speaking, Momentive RSUs, Momentive restricted stock and Momentive options will be
treated at the effective time of the merger as follows:
•
Each vested Momentive RSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive common stock subject
to such vested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding
taxes.
•
Each unvested Momentive RSU will be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive
a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive common stock
subject to such unvested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable
withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted
cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding unvested Momentive RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.
•
Each share of Momentive restricted stock will be cancelled and converted into the contingent right
to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive common
stock subject to such outstanding Momentive restricted stock award, multiplied by (2) the per
share price, less withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each
such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms
and conditions as applied to the corresponding Momentive restricted stock award immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.
•
Each vested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive common stock
subject to the vested Momentive option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price
over the exercise price per share of Momentive common stock under such vested Momentive
option, less applicable withholding taxes.
•
Each unvested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to
receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive common
stock subject to such unvested Momentive option, multiplied by (2) the excess of the per share
price over the exercise price per share of Momentive common stock under such unvested
Momentive option, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger
agreement, each such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same
vesting terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding unvested Momentive option
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is
not satisfied.
•
Any underwater Momentive option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no
consideration or payment.
Q:
What will happen to the ESPP?
A:
We have taken, or will take prior to the effective time of the merger, all action that we determine to be
reasonably necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the merger, (1) cause any offering period
or purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be outstanding at the effective time of the
merger to be terminated no later than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger; (2) make
any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase
period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and
completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (3) cause the
exercise (as of no later than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger) of each
outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (4) provide that no further offering period or
purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP upon or after the effective time of the merger. The
ESPP will terminate as of the effective time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the
merger).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?

•
to adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Momentive
and Momentive will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;
•
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable
by Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; and

A:
The special meeting will take place on May 31, 2023 at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time. You may attend the
s p e c i a l  m e e t i n g  v i a  a  l i v e  i n t e r a c t i v e  w e b c a s t  o n  t h e  i n t e r n e t  a t
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MNTV2023SM. You will be able to listen to the special meeting live
and vote online. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting instruction form in
order to participate in the special meeting (including voting your shares).
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
All of Momentive’s stockholders as of the close of business on April 12, 2023, which is the record date
for the special meeting, are entitled to vote their shares of Momentive common stock at the special
meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 150,689,947 shares of Momentive
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of Momentive
common stock outstanding as of the record date is entitled to one vote per share on each matter
properly brought before the special meeting.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Momentive
common stock as of the record date and entitled to vote is required to adopt the merger agreement.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the
internet or by telephone; or (3) attend and vote at the special meeting, will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name,”
the failure to instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory
basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to its named
executive officers in connection with the merger; and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting?
A:
Approval of the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Momentive common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Momentive common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the
internet or by telephone; or (3) vote at the special meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, or the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting, except to the
extent that such failure affects obtaining a quorum at the meeting. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have
any effect on these proposals, except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining a quorum at the
meeting. In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement, and the
documents that we refer to or incorporate by reference in this proxy statement carefully and consider
how the merger affects you.
Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, please sign, date, and return, as promptly as
possible, the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant
your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy
card), so that your shares can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,”
please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker, or other nominee for information
on how to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you
attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will revoke any previously
submitted proxy.
Q:
How does the Momentive Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Momentive Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by
Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the
adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at
the time of the special meeting.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not adopted by Momentive’s stockholders or if the merger is not completed
for any other reason, Momentive’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of
Momentive common stock in connection with the merger. Instead: (1) Momentive will remain an
independent public company; (2) Momentive common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the
Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) Momentive will continue to file periodic reports
with the SEC.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Momentive has agreed to pay
Parent (or its designee) a termination fee. In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is
terminated, Parent has agreed to pay Momentive a reverse termination fee, the payment of which has
been guaranteed by the Guarantors.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-
Termination Fees and Remedies.”
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to its named
executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger
and payable to certain of Momentive’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and
arrangements that are contractual in nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent
or its affiliates (including, following the consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation) to
Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with or following the merger is not subject to this
advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 2:
Approval, on a Non-Binding, Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation.”
23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become
payable by Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the
merger? 
A:
Momentive is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or
may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the
merger. Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger is not required to consummate the merger.
Q:
What will happen if Momentive’s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or
may become payable by Momentive to its named executive officers in connection with the
merger?
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to consummation of the merger. This
is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Momentive or Parent. The underlying plans and
arrangements providing for such compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms,
subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by Momentive’s stockholders and the merger is
consummated, the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger will or may be paid to Momentive’s named
executive officers even if Momentive’s stockholders do not approve such compensation.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial
owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Momentive’s transfer agent, Computershare
Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of
record.” If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent
directly to you by or on behalf of Momentive. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special
meeting and vote your shares at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy
card.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker, or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial
owner” of shares of Momentive common stock held in “street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of
shares of Momentive common stock held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to
you by your bank, broker, or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker, or other
nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend
the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other
nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker automatically vote my shares
for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker, or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently
scheduled to be considered at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker, or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker, or other nominee
to vote your shares. Without instruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of obtaining a
quorum or voted on the proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” adoption
of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory
basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Momentive common stock are registered in
your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., Momentive’s transfer agent), there are four ways
to vote:
•
by signing, dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for
your convenience);
•
by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
•
by calling the toll-free (within the United States or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the special meeting virtually and voting at the special meeting using the control
number on the enclosed proxy card.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote
your shares of Momentive common stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been
properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is no
charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur
costs such as internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of
Momentive common stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to
vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Momentive common stock at
the special meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and
vote at the special meeting, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker, or other nominee, you may vote through
your bank, broker, or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by
your bank, broker, or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker, or other
nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone
through your bank, broker, or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction
form provided by your bank, broker, or nominee. However, because you are not the stockholder of
record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from
your bank, broker, or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
If you hold your shares of Momentive common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank,
broker, or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the
special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other nominee giving you the
right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time
before it is voted at the special meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to Momentive’s Chief Legal Officer & Secretary; or
•
attending the special meeting virtually and voting at the special meeting using the control number
on the enclosed proxy card.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy
card will vote your shares in the way that you direct.
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be
voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended
by the
25
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Momentive Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1) “FOR” the
adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by
Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the
adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at
the time of the special meeting.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of
transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order
to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of Momentive common stock represented by
your stock certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to
exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send
your stock certificates with your proxy card.
If you hold your shares of Momentive common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of
transmittal. Instead, the payment agent will pay you the appropriate portion of the merger consideration
upon receipt of a customary “agent’s message” and in accordance with the reasonable terms and
conditions as the payment agent may impose.
Q:
What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before
the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the
anticipated effective time of the merger. If you sell or transfer your shares of Momentive common stock
after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of
a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of
you notifies Momentive in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the per share price with respect to such shares, if the merger is completed, to
the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares
at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your shares of Momentive common stock after the
record date, we encourage you to sign, date, and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply
envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by
telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card).
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date, and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for)
each proxy card and voting instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy
statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently
or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage
account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name,
you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting materials that you receive.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
If available, Momentive may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special
meeting. Momentive intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed
with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Momentive files with the SEC are publicly
available when filed. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where
You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash
pursuant to the merger?
A:
For a U.S. holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of Momentive common stock for
26
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which
generally will require such U.S. holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder in
the merger and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Momentive common stock
surrendered in the merger.
A Non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax with respect to the exchange of Momentive common stock for cash in the merger unless
such Non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup
withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise
establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor to
determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own
particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the
laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general
information only and does not constitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of
material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the merger in the second or third quarter of 2023. However, the exact
timing of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the
closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of Momentive’s
control.
Q:
What governmental and regulatory approvals are required?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period (and
any extensions thereof) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, or
all requisite consents pursuant thereto have been obtained. In addition, the merger cannot be completed
until all approvals and clearances of the relevant governmental authorities under the specified foreign
direct investment laws have been obtained.
Momentive and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR
Act with the FTC and the DOJ on March 24, 2023. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
expired at 11:59 p.m., California time on April 24, 2023.
In addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with Momentive, submitted the specified foreign
direct investment filing in Italy on April 20, 2023 and may submit additional foreign direct investment
filings under certain circumstances.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the merger is consummated, Momentive’s stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of
capital stock) who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold
their shares of Momentive’s common stock through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect
appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements as described in
this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal
will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the

Q:
Do any of Momentive’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from
those of Momentive stockholders generally? 
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Momentive Board with respect to the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, you should be aware that Momentive’s directors and executive officers may have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Momentive’s
stockholders generally. In: (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the
merger agreement; and (3) unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by
Momentive’s stockholders, the Momentive Board was aware of and considered these interests to the
extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Momentive’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger.”

intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. Such
forward-looking statements include statements relating to Momentive’s strategy, goals, future focus areas,
and the value of the proposed transaction to Momentive’s stockholders. These forward-looking statements
are based on Momentive’s management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to
management. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be
identified by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,”
“target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or similar

uncertainties, including statements regarding: the merger, including the expected timing of the closing of the
merger; considerations taken into account by the Momentive Board in approving the merger; and
expectations for Momentive following the closing of the merger.
If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if any of Momentive’s assumptions prove incorrect,
Momentive’s actual results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forward-
looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties include those associated with:
•
the possibility that the conditions to the closing of the merger are not satisfied, including the risk
that required approvals from Momentive’s stockholders for the merger or required regulatory
approvals to consummate the merger are not obtained, on a timely basis or at all;
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right to
terminate the merger, including in circumstances requiring Momentive to pay a termination fee;
•
uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of the merger and the ability of each party to
consummate the merger;
•
the nature, cost, and outcome of any legal proceeding that may be instituted against Momentive
and others relating to the merger;
•
economic, market, financial, business or geopolitical conditions (including resulting from
disruptions to the banking sector, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, supply chain
disruptions, the COVID-19 pandemic, civil unrest or military conflict including military conflict in
Ukraine and related sanctions against Russia and Belarus) or competition, or changes in such
conditions, negatively affecting Momentive’s markets, customers, business, operations and
financial performance;
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on Momentive’s business relationships,
customers, operating results, and business generally, including risks related to the diversion of the
attention of Momentive management or employees during the pendency of the merger;
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses, and charges related to the merger agreement or the
merger;
•
risks that the pendency of the merger affects our current operations or our ability to retain or recruit
employees;
•
the risk that Momentive’s stock price may fluctuate during the pendency of the merger and may
decline significantly if the merger is not completed;
•
the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Momentive is restrained from soliciting other
acquisition proposals during the pendency of the merger;
•
the fact that, if the merger is completed, Momentive’s stockholders will forgo the opportunity to
realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of Momentive’s current strategy as
an independent company;

Only Momentive’s stockholders as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and
to vote at, the special meeting. A list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will be
available for inspection by stockholders for any purpose germane to the special meeting at Momentive’s

for a period of ten days ending on the day before the date of the special meeting. You will need the control
number included on your proxy card or otherwise provided by your bank, broker, or other nominee to access
the stockholder list during the special meeting.
As of the record date, there were 150,689,947 shares of Momentive common stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of Momentive common stock issued and outstanding
as of the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly

The holders of a majority of the voting power of the capital stock of Momentive issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting.

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Momentive common stock as of the record date and
entitled to vote on the proposal. Adoption of the merger agreement by Momentive’s stockholders is a
condition to the closing of the merger.
31TABLE OF CONTENTS
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by
Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Momentive common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Momentive common stock present in person
or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted: (1)
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the
special meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists.
A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker, or other nominee holding shares on your behalf
does not vote on a proposal because the bank, broker, or other nominee has not received your voting
instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote your shares. We do not expect any “broker non-votes” at
the special meeting, but if there are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a
quorum is present. If there are broker non-votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on: (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger

form provided by your bank, broker, or other nominee. If you do not (1) return your bank’s, broker’s, or other

other nominee; or (3) attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting with a “legal proxy” from
your bank, broker, or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the proposal to

submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to Momentive’s Chief Legal Officer & Secretary; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the

basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to Momentive’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger, Momentive’s stockholders are also being asked to approve any
proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional votes or proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement. If a quorum is not present, the
chairperson of the special meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in
person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, without notice other
than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. The chairperson may also
adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date or time, even if a quorum is present. In addition, the

Momentive’s behalf. In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers, and other nominees representing
beneficial owners of shares of Momentive’s common stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting
materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by Momentive’s directors, officers, and
employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax or over the internet. No additional compensation will be

We currently expect to complete the merger in the second or third quarter of 2023. However, the exact
timing of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing
conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of Momentive’s control.
Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, Momentive’s stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of capital
stock) who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their
shares through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain
other conditions and statutory requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in
connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of
the DGCL are satisfied. This means that such persons will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares by
the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
Momentive common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to
be the fair value from
34TABLE OF CONTENTS
the effective time of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between the effective time of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly
(except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a
voluntary cash payment to each person seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum
of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving
corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are
encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of
their shares.
To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record or a beneficial owner must (1) submit a written
demand for appraisal to Momentive before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
(2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to
hold of record or own beneficially the subject shares of Momentive common stock through the effective time
of the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the
DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of
appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of
Momentive unless certain conditions are satisfied by the persons seeking appraisal. The requirements under
Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy
statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of

Effect on Momentive if the Merger is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not adopted by Momentive’s stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for
any other reason, Momentive’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Momentive
common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, (1) Momentive will remain an independent public
company; (2) Momentive common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered
under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the
merger is not completed. We expect that: (A) Momentive’s management will continue to operate the
business as it is currently being operated; and (B) Momentive’s stockholders will continue to be subject to
the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly
competitive industry in which Momentive operates and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the merger not
to be completed, there can be no assurance as to the price at which Momentive common stock may trade,
and the price of Momentive common stock could decline significantly.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the effect of the merger not being completed on the future
value of your shares of Momentive common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Momentive Board will
continue to evaluate and review, among other things, Momentive’s business, operations, strategic direction,
and capitalization, and will make whatever changes it deems appropriate. If the merger agreement is not
adopted by Momentive’s stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Momentive’s
business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely impacted.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Momentive has agreed to pay
Parent (or its designee) the applicable termination fee.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time of the
merger:
•
each share of Momentive common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger (other than excluded shares, if any) will be automatically converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the per share price less any applicable
withholding taxes; and
•
each outstanding share of Momentive common stock that is (1) held by Momentive as treasury
stock; (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid in exchange therefor.
At or prior to the closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the payment agent an amount
of cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate merger consideration to Momentive’s
stockholders. Once a stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her, or its stock certificates for
cancellation (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate) and appropriate letter of transmittal or
customary agent’s message with respect to book-entry shares, in accordance with the reasonable terms
and conditions as the payment agent may impose, then the payment agent will pay the stockholder his, her,
or its applicable portion of the aggregate merger consideration payable to Momentive’s stockholders. For
more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Payment
Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

price for each share of Momentive common stock that such stockholder owned, as described in the section
of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Conversion of Shares,” but will no longer have any
rights as a Momentive stockholder (except that Momentive’s stockholders holding shares with respect to
which an appropriate person has properly and validly exercised and perfected, and has not validly withdrawn
or otherwise lost their appraisal rights will have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their shares,

section of this proxy statement captioned “-Appraisal Rights”).

MOMENTIVE GLOBAL INC._20230427_DEFM14A_20826404_4653973.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Momentive Board established a strategic committee of the Momentive Board (which we refer to as the
“Strategic Committee”) on August 12, 2021 to oversee the exploration and evaluation of potential strategic
alternatives available to Momentive. The Strategic Committee was formed in light of (1) the potentially
significant workload that could be involved in evaluating potential strategic alternatives; (2) the possibility that
Momentive management may need feedback and direction on relatively short notice; and (3) the benefits and
convenience of having a subset of directors oversee and direct the process of considering potential strategic
alternatives. The Momentive Board authorized and instructed the Strategic Committee, among other things,
to (1) oversee and provide assistance to Momentive management and Momentive’s advisors with respect to
the exploration, evaluation, consideration, review and negotiation of the terms and conditions of any potential
strategic alternative, including a possible sale of Momentive; (2) take such other actions with respect to any
strategic alternative as the Strategic Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable; and (3)
recommend to the Momentive Board the actions, if any, that should be taken by Momentive with respect to
any strategic alternative or transaction. The Momentive Board retained the power and authority to approve
the final decision on pursuing a strategic alternative, including a sale of Momentive, and the entry by
Momentive into a definitive agreement providing for a sale transaction was not conditioned on any specific
recommendation by the Strategic Committee. It was also understood that the Momentive Board would
continue to have an active role in the consideration of potential strategic alternatives. The Momentive Board
did not provide for the payment of any compensation to the members of the Strategic Committee in
consideration of their service on the Strategic Committee. The Momentive Board also delegated to the
Strategic Committee the authority to engage, on behalf of Momentive, one or more financial advisors to
assist in connection with these matters. Upon formation, the Strategic Committee was initially composed of
Sue Decker, as chair of the Strategic Committee, David Ebersman and Brad Smith.
On October 28, 2021, Momentive entered into a merger agreement with Zendesk, Inc. (which we refer to as
“Zendesk”) providing for the acquisition of Momentive by Zendesk (which we refer to as the
“Zendesk merger agreement”) in a stock-for-stock transaction. The entry by Momentive into the Zendesk
merger agreement was the result of a process conducted by Momentive and overseen by the Momentive
Board and the Strategic Committee to solicit interest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive
from a number of potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors (the “2021 solicitation process”).
Additional information regarding the 2021 solicitation process and the Zendesk merger agreement was
publicly disclosed by Momentive in the definitive proxy statement filed by Momentive on January 7, 2022
with the SEC in connection with Momentive’s solicitation of proxies from Momentive stockholders to adopt
the Zendesk merger agreement, and the other documents filed by Momentive with the SEC. The terms used
in this proxy statement to refer to counterparties with which Momentive engaged do not correspond to terms
used to refer to the counterparties that participated in the 2021 solicitation process as described in the
definitive proxy statement filed by Momentive on January 7, 2022. Momentive common stock closed trading
at a price of $20.61 on October 6, 2021, the day prior to media reports that Momentive was exploring
options, including a potential sale after receiving takeover interest. Momentive common stock closed trading
at a price of $24.92 per share on October 28, 2021, prior to the announcement of Momentive’s entry into the
Zendesk merger agreement following the close of trading on October 28, 2021, and closed trading at $22.92
per share on October 29, 2022, the first trading day after the announcement of Momentive’s entry into the
Zendesk merger agreement.
On February 25, 2022, Zendesk terminated the Zendesk merger agreement after Zendesk’s stockholders
failed to approve the issuance of shares of Zendesk common stock to Momentive stockholders as
consideration in connection with the acquisition. Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of
$15.72 per share on February 28, 2022, the first trading day after the announcement of the termination of the
Zendesk merger agreement.
As described below, following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, the Momentive Board and
the Strategic Committee continued to consider and explore, from time to time, various potential strategic
alternatives for Momentive, including, among others, (1) the continued execution of Momentive’s standalone
business plan, with Momentive remaining an independent entity; (2) new business and product initiatives,
operational adjustments, cost-cutting initiatives and other revisions to Momentive’s business plan; (3) return
of capital to Momentive stockholders, including through a share buyback program; and (4) business
combinations and other financial and strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of Momentive.
39TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 25, 2022, Momentive’s engagement letters with each of Allen & Company LLC (which we refer
to as “Allen & Company”) and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (which we refer to as “J.P. Morgan”),
Momentive’s financial advisors in connection with the 2021 solicitation process, expired pursuant to their
terms.
On February 28, 2022, Momentive announced the execution of a letter agreement with Legion Partners and
certain related persons and entities, pursuant to which, among other things, Sagar Gupta, Senior Analyst
and Head of Technology, Media and Telecommunications Investing at Legion Partners, was appointed to the
Momentive Board and to the Strategic Committee. On February 28, 2022, Mr. Smith stepped down as a
director of Momentive and member of Strategic Committee. Following the appointment of Mr. Gupta to the
Momentive Board, the Strategic Committee was composed of Ms. Decker, Mr. Ebersman and Mr. Gupta.
From time to time prior to and following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, certain
Momentive stockholders contacted Momentive regarding governance, leadership and other strategic and
operational matters at Momentive, and Momentive management and directors would seek to engage in
discussions with these parties as appropriate.
The Strategic Committee met in March 2022 following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement to
review the 2021 solicitation process and discuss other strategic alternatives available to Momentive. The
Strategic Committee considered whether to engage one or more additional financial advisors in connection
with the continued exploration and evaluation of potential strategic alternatives available to Momentive. The
Strategic Committee met with several potential advisors to consider their candidacy for this role.
In addition, from time to time following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, representatives of
certain financial sponsors that had participated in the 2021 solicitation process contacted Zander Lurie,
Momentive’s chief executive officer, to discuss Momentive’s business. Two such financial sponsors, which
we refer to as “Financial Sponsor A” and “Financial Sponsor B” indicated to Mr. Lurie a non-specific
interest in continuing discussions with respect to a potential strategic transaction involving Momentive. Mr.
Lurie would update the Strategic Committee with respect to these outreaches.
On March 25, 2022, the Strategic Committee met with members of Momentive management and
representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, Momentive’s outside
counsel (which we refer to as “Wilson Sonsini”), in attendance. At the Strategic Committee’s invitation,
representatives of Qatalyst Partners attended a portion of the meeting to present to the Strategic Committee
their qualifications and experience acting as financial advisor to companies in Momentive’s industry, as well
as their preliminary views on Momentive’s financial profile and its strategic alternatives. After representatives
of Qatalyst Partners left the meeting, Mr. Lurie discussed the outreaches by Financial Sponsor A and
Financial Sponsor B. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive
management in attendance, to discuss these matters. The Strategic Committee, in executive session,
considered the qualifications and expertise of Qatalyst Partners and other various potential advisors to act
as financial advisor to Momentive, and requested that Qatalyst Partners submit a proposal with respect to
the terms of an engagement by Momentive. Qatalyst Partners provided an initial draft of an engagement
letter with respect to the engagement on March 29, 2022.
On March 28, 2022, Financial Sponsor A delivered a written, non-binding indication of interest to the
Momentive Board expressing its interest in acquiring Momentive at an unspecified market premium to the
then-current market price of Momentive common stock. Momentive had previously entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor A as part of the 2021 solicitation process, which remained
in effect. On that day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $16.96 per share.
On April 1, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive
management presented a draft long-range plan for Momentive, which reflected updates to the long-range
plan for Momentive previously approved by the Momentive Board prior to the execution of the Zendesk
merger agreement to reflect recent trends and headwinds in Momentive’s business and Momentive
management’s expectations for deteriorations in Momentive’s prospective operational and financial
performance, including as a result of the adverse impact of the pendency and termination of the acquisition
by Zendesk on Momentive’s operations and hiring and retention of employees. The Strategic Committee
discussed the plan, and requested that Momentive management present the draft plan to the Momentive
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board at a subsequently scheduled meeting to obtain the views and feedback of the Momentive directors on
the draft plan. The Strategic Committee reviewed with Mr. Lurie and representatives of Qatalyst Partners the
non-binding indication of interest received from Financial Sponsor A, and discussed whether and how
Momentive should respond. The Strategic Committee also discussed the possibility of initiating another
process to solicit interest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive from potential counterparties
at that time and other strategic alternatives available to Momentive, including continuing to execute
Momentive’s standalone business plan. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without
Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters.
On April 6, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners presented a preliminary financial overview of Momentive and certain market perspectives on
Momentive. The Strategic Committee discussed the possibility of engaging in discussions with Financial
Sponsor A in response to its indication of interest, as well as commencing a broader outreach to additional
counterparties to solicit interest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive at that time. The
Strategic Committee also discussed the potential risks of engaging with Financial Sponsor A and of an
outreach to additional counterparties, including potential public disclosure leaks, Momentive management
and employee distraction, and adverse impacts on Momentive’s business and employee morale, particularly
if a transaction was not ultimately consummated. In this regard, the Strategic Committee noted that the
adverse impacts would be heightened due to the recent termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, and
the increase in the likelihood of those risks if Momentive were to engage extensively with Financial Sponsor
A or engage in a broader private or public process. The Strategic Committee determined to recommend to
the Momentive Board that Momentive engage with Financial Sponsor A to understand whether it would,
following access to Momentive management and non-public information, be in a position to quickly submit a
more specific acquisition proposal. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without
Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance. In executive session,
representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the negotiation of the terms of Qatalyst Partners’
engagement. The Strategic Committee approved the engagement of Qatalyst Partners to serve as financial
advisor to Momentive consistent with the terms discussed at the meeting and directed Momentive
management and Wilson Sonsini to finalize the engagement. The Strategic Committee noted Qatalyst
Partners’ extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which Momentive operates and experience
advising technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. The Momentive Board
also received and reviewed from Qatalyst Partners a conflict disclosure letter, from which the Momentive
Board did not identify matters that would limit Qatalyst Partners’ ability to fulfill its responsibilities as
financial advisor to Momentive. On April 8, 2022, Momentive entered into an engagement letter with Qatalyst
Partners to act as Momentive’s financial advisor in connection with the continued exploration and evaluation
of potential strategic alternatives.
Also on April 8, 2022, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive
management presented a draft long-range plan for Momentive previously presented to the Strategic
Committee, including updates to reflect recent trends and headwinds in Momentive’s business and
Momentive management’s expectations for deteriorations in Momentive’s prospective operational and
financial performance, including as a result of the adverse impact of the pendency and termination of the
acquisition by Zendesk on Momentive’s operations and hiring and retention of employees. Following
discussion, the Momentive Board approved the long-range plan presented at the meeting, including the
unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 included in the updated long-
range plan (which we refer to as the “April 2022 long-range plan”). Additional information about the
preparation and substance of the April 2022 long-range plan is contained in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.”. The Momentive Board reviewed the
non-binding indication of interest received from Financial Sponsor A. The Momentive Board considered the
possibility of engaging in discussions with Financial Sponsor A, as well as commencing a broader outreach
at that time to additional financial sponsors and potential strategic acquirors to solicit interest regarding a
strategic transaction involving Momentive. The Momentive Board also discussed the potential risks of
engaging with Financial Sponsor A and of an outreach to additional counterparties, including adverse
impacts on Momentive’s business and employee morale, particularly if a transaction was not ultimately
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
consummated. In this regard, the Strategic Committee noted that the adverse impacts would be heightened
due to the recent termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, and the increase in the likelihood of those
risks if Momentive were to engage extensively with Financial Sponsor A or engage in a broader private or
public process. The Strategic Committee delivered its recommendation that Momentive engage with
Financial Sponsor A, allowing access to Momentive management and non-public information, to understand
whether it would be in a position to quickly submit a more specific acquisition proposal. Following
discussion, the Momentive Board authorized engaging with Financial Sponsor A and providing due diligence
information, including Momentive’s updated long-range plan, to Financial Sponsor A in order to understand
whether it would submit a more specific acquisition proposal. The Momentive Board also determined not to
initiate a broader outreach process at this time.
On April 18, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided a summary of the April 2022 long-range
plan to representatives of Financial Sponsor A in accordance with the Momentive Board’s instructions.
On April 19, 2022, members of Momentive management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners met with
representatives of Financial Sponsor A to provide due diligence information regarding Momentive’s business.
On April 20, 2022, a member of the Momentive Board received an unsolicited inbound inquiry from a
potential strategic counterparty (which we refer to as “Strategic A”) about the possibility of a potential
combination.
On April 22, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A and reviewed the inquiry received from
Strategic A. The Strategic Committee discussed with Qatalyst Partners considerations with respect to
Strategic A’s ability to finance and consummate an acquisition of Momentive. Following the discussion, the
Strategic Committee determined that Strategic A would not be in a position to acquire Momentive on the
basis of these considerations and declined to engage in discussions with Strategic A. The Strategic
Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst
Partners in attendance, and discussed Momentive’s business and strategic alternatives available to
Momentive.
On April 25, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A contacted Mr. Ebersman and communicated to
him that they would not be able to submit a proposal with respect to an acquisition of Momentive that they
believed the Momentive Board would find acceptable. Separately, representatives of Financial Sponsor A
communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they believed Financial Sponsor A could propose
an acquisition of Momentive potentially at a price in cash of up to $20.00 per share of Momentive common
stock, but not more. Financial Sponsor A did not make a formal acquisition proposal to Momentive. On that
day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $17.63 per share.
On April 27, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A. In addition, representatives of
Qatalyst Partners presented a preliminary financial overview of Momentive and certain market perspectives
on Momentive, as well as an analysis of Financial Sponsor A’s ability to pay a higher price per share in an
acquisition of Momentive. The Strategic Committee discussed the likelihood of reaching an agreement with
Financial Sponsor A with respect to an acquisition of Momentive at a price of $20.00 per share and the risks
of pursuing such a transaction if it were not ultimately consummated, including adverse impacts on
Momentive’s business and employee morale. Members of Momentive management provided an update on
Momentive’s business performance. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without
Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss
these matters. Following discussion, the Strategic Committee approved continuing to engage with Financial
Sponsor A to determine whether it would submit an acquisition proposal at a price of $20.00 per share of
Momentive common stock.
On April 28, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners communicated to representatives of Financial
Sponsor A that Momentive would be willing to continue to engage in discussions with Financial Sponsor A
regarding a potential acquisition. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners, in accordance with the direction of
the Strategic Committee, noted that the Momentive Board might be receptive to an acquisition proposal at a
price of at least $20.00 per share. Representatives of Financial Sponsor A indicated their belief that there
was
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a “50-50” possibility that they would be in a position to acquire Momentive at a price of $20.00 per share.
Following the discussion, representatives of Financial Sponsor A requested additional due diligence
information to support an acquisition proposal at that level. On that day, Momentive common stock closed
trading at a price of $16.30 per share.
On May 6, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A, including the due diligence
information requested by Financial Sponsor A. The Strategic Committee authorized Momentive management
to provide the requested due diligence information.
On May 9, 2022, Momentive provided Financial Sponsor A with access to a virtual data room to share the
requested due diligence information.
On May 16, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A communicated to representatives of Qatalyst
Partners that, based on trends in Momentive’s business and in the market environment, it could not support
an acquisition of Momentive at a price of $20.00 per share nor could they provide an acquisition proposal at
an alternative price at that time. The representatives of Financial Sponsor A noted that they continue to be
admirers of the business and hoped to be able to re-visit the opportunity once the market and business
trends stabilize. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners informed the members of the Strategic Committee of
Financial Sponsor A’s communication. On that day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of
$12.09 per share.
On May 20, 2022, the Momentive Board met with members of Momentive management and with
representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Ms. Decker provided an update on
Momentive’s discussions with Financial Sponsor A, including its communication that it could not support an
acquisition of Momentive at a price of $20.00 per share of Momentive common stock nor could it provide an
acquisition proposal at an alternative price at that time, but that representatives of Financial Sponsor A had
noted that they continue to be admirers of the business and hoped to be able to re-visit the opportunity once
the market and business trends stabilize. The Momentive Board considered the possibility of commencing a
broader outreach to additional financial sponsors and potential strategic acquirors to solicit interest
regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive. The Momentive Board also met in executive session,
without Momentive management in attendance, and continued to discuss strategic alternatives available to
Momentive.
On May 26, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A. In addition, representatives of
Qatalyst Partners presented certain market perspectives on Momentive and a review of recent disruptions in
Momentive’s industry and the broader technology sector. The Strategic Committee discussed the possibility
of commencing a broader outreach to additional financial sponsors and potential strategic acquirors to solicit
interest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive. The Strategic Committee noted that Financial
Sponsor A had not submitted an acquisition proposal, the headwinds and trends in Momentive’s industry
and business, and the volatility in the price of Momentive common stock and companies in the technology
sector generally that would make an agreement on a potential acquisition price more challenging. The
Strategic Committee also considered the risks of pursuing a transaction with Financial Sponsor A or other
counterparties that was not ultimately consummated, including adverse impacts on Momentive’s business
and employee morale. Following discussion, based on these considerations and the fact that Financial
Sponsor A had not submitted an acquisition proposal, the Strategic Committee determined not to continue
discussions with Financial Sponsor A, and to recommend to the Momentive Board that Momentive focus on
the execution of its business plan at this time and not initiate a broader outreach process. The Momentive
Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of
Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters. The Strategic Committee
subsequently updated the Momentive Board with respect to its determinations.

On June 1, 2022, the Momentive Board received a private letter from a Momentive stockholder encouraging
the Momentive Board to conduct a sale process. Subsequently, on June 4, 2022, the Momentive Board
received a private email from another Momentive stockholder encouraging the Momentive Board to pursue a
sale.
On June 15, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners presented an overview of trading market trends for Momentive, companies in Momentive’s industry
and the broader technology sector. Members of Momentive management provided an update on Momentive’s
business performance. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive
management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters.
From time to time in June through September 2022, representatives of various financial sponsors and
financial advisors contacted Mr. Lurie and other representatives of Momentive to express a non-specific
interest in discussing Momentive’s business. Mr. Lurie referred these individuals to Qatalyst Partners for
further discussions. Mr. Lurie and Qatalyst Partners would update the Strategic Committee and the
Momentive Board with respect to these outreaches. Such discussions did not result in an actionable
indication of interest or proposal regarding an acquisition of Momentive at that time.
On July 21, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners presented certain market perspectives on Momentive and its industry. The Strategic Committee
discussed the possibility of initiating an outreach process to potential counterparties to solicit interest in a
potential strategic transaction involving Momentive and determined that it was not the right time to initiate a
process at that time due to volatility in the market prices of Momentive common stock and other companies
in Momentive’s industry and the technology sector generally. The Strategic Committee also met in executive
session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance. On that
day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $9.89 per share.
On August 17, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners presented a preliminary financial overview of Momentive and certain market perspectives on
Momentive and its industry. The Strategic Committee discussed how a potential outreach process to solicit
interest in a potential strategic transaction would work, certain potential counterparties for a potential
strategic transaction and illustrative timelines for such a process. Members of Momentive management
provided an update on Momentive’s business performance. The Strategic Committee also met in executive
session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and
continued to discuss these matters.
On August 21, 2022, a representative of Financial Sponsor A contacted Mr. Ebersman to indicate that
Financial Sponsor A would be interested in re-engaging with Momentive with respect to a potential
transaction at a non-specific lower price than previously discussed. Mr. Ebersman referred the representative
of Financial Sponsor A to Qatalyst Partners for discussion, in which the representative of Financial Sponsor
A expressed an interest in re-engaging with Momentive with Momentive with respect to a potential
transaction at a non-specific lower valuation. On that day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a
price of $7.39 per share on August 19, 2022.
On August 28, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A, including its request to re-engage in
due diligence and the preliminary indications on a lower valuation provided by representatives of Financial
Sponsor A. The Strategic Committee discussed the possibility of re-engaging in discussions with Financial
Sponsor A at that time, including as part of a broader outreach to additional counterparties. The Strategic
Committee noted that Financial Sponsor A had previously engaged in discussions with Momentive without
submitting an acquisition proposal, and the headwinds, uncertainty and market volatility in the technology
sector generally, as well as in Momentive’s business, had not improved since that time. The Strategic
Committee also considered the risks of pursuing a transaction with Financial Sponsor A or other
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
counterparties that was not ultimately consummated, including adverse impacts on Momentive’s business
and employee morale. Following discussion, based on these considerations and the Strategic Committee’s
uncertainty regarding whether Financial Sponsor A would submit an actionable acquisition proposal, the
Strategic Committee determined not to re-engage with Financial Sponsor A at that time. The Strategic
Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst
Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters.
On August 28, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed whether to engage
Qatalyst Partners to also act as financial advisor to the Company in connection with potential shareholder
activism in light of outreaches from Momentive stockholders and potential future shareholder activism,
including the possibility of a proxy contest at Momentive’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, and the
additional compensation that might be payable to Qatalyst Partners in connection with such matters. The
Strategic Committee directed Momentive management to discuss the terms of a potential engagement with
Qatalyst Partners. The Strategic Committee also discussed illustrative timelines for a process to solicit
interest in a potential strategic transaction. Following the meeting, Momentive management discussed with
Qatalyst Partners the terms of a potential engagement with respect to potential shareholder activism and
governance matters.
On September 16, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners presented certain market perspectives on Momentive and its industry. The Strategic Committee
discussed how a potential outreach process to solicit interest in a potential strategic transaction would work
and illustrative timelines for such a process. Members of Momentive management provided an update on
Momentive’s business performance and strategic and cost-cutting initiatives underway at Momentive, and
the Strategic Committee discussed these initiatives in the context of a potential outreach process. The
Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of
Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters.
On October 4, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor with investments in companies in Momentive’s
industry and that had participated in the 2021 solicitation process (which we refer to as “Financial
Sponsor C”) contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and requested to re-initiate discussions
regarding a potential strategic transaction involving Momentive. Momentive had previously entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor C as part of the 2021 solicitation process, which remained
in effect.
On October 6, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive
management provided an update on Momentive’s business performance and strategic and cost-cutting
initiatives underway at Momentive. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided an update on discussions
with Financial Sponsor C. The Strategic Committee discussed timelines for a potential outreach process to
solicit interest in a potential strategic transaction, and reviewed with representatives of Qatalyst Partners
additional potential acquirors that might have an interest in a strategic transaction involving Momentive.
Following discussion, the Strategic Committee directed Qatalyst Partners to engage with Financial Sponsor
C to determine whether it would submit an acquisition proposal. The Strategic Committee also directed
Momentive management to begin preparing due diligence information in anticipation of a potential broader
outreach process. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management
or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters.
On October 7, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, in accordance with the direction of the Strategic
Committee, communicated to representatives of Financial Sponsor C that the Momentive Board would be
open to engaging in discussions if Financial Sponsor C were to submit an acquisition proposal based on
publicly available information.

informed the representatives of Financial Sponsor A that Momentive had received credible unsolicited
interest from another party regarding a potential acquisition.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On October 12, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners
to follow up on Mr. Ebersman’s communication, and representatives of Qatalyst Partners confirmed that
Momentive had received credible unsolicited interest regarding a potential acquisition. The representatives of
Financial Sponsor A responded that Financial Sponsor A continued to be interested in a potential acquisition
of Momentive.
On October 13, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor A communicated an oral, non-binding indication
of interest with respect to an acquisition of Momentive at a price of $12.00 per share of Momentive common
stock based on publicly available information. They indicated that they could complete their diligence and
negotiate a definitive agreement within four weeks and asked to be able to move forward.
After the close of trading on October 13, 2022, Momentive announced (1) a restructuring plan designed to
improve operating margin and create efficiencies in Momentive’s go-to-market motion and in other areas
throughout Momentive, which involved a reduction of Momentive’s workforce by approximately 11 percent
and (2) that expected revenue and operating margin for the third quarter 2022 would be within the guidance
ranges Momentive previously disclosed when it reported its second quarter results for 2022.
On October 18, 2022, Financial Sponsor C submitted a written, non-binding proposal to acquire Momentive
at a price of $10.50 per share of Momentive common stock. The proposal contemplated an acquisition of
Momentive by a portfolio company of Financial Sponsor C.
On October 18, 2022, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $6.49 per share. This was the
last trading day prior to published rumors that Momentive was considering a potential sale.
On October 19, 2022, Bloomberg and other media outlets published a report that Momentive was
considering a sale after receiving takeover interest.
Also on October 19, 2022, representatives of STG contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners following
the media reports that Momentive was considering a sale. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed
with representatives of STG their non-specific interest in a potential acquisition of Momentive and their
capacity to consummate a potential acquisition. The representatives of STG indicated they would contact
Qatalyst Partners again if they determined to make an acquisition proposal based on their review of publicly
available information regarding Momentive. On that same day, representatives of a financial advisor
contacted Mr. Lurie to introduce him to representatives of STG. Mr. Lurie referred the representatives of STG
to Qatalyst Partners.
Also on October 19, 2022, representatives of a financial sponsor (which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor
D”) contacted representatives of Momentive following the media reports that Momentive was considering a
sale. Representatives of Financial Sponsor D had previously contacted representatives of Momentive in
September 2022, including a director, to express a non-specific interest in discussing Momentive’s
business.
On October 20, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with Financial Sponsor A, including the request for due
diligence information to confirm its valuation, and reviewed the acquisition proposal received from Financial
Sponsor C. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also noted that other financial sponsors had recently
contacted representatives of Momentive and Qatalyst Partners and expressed an interest in discussing
Momentive’s business. The Strategic Committee discussed whether to initiate a process to solicit interest in
a potential strategic transaction based on the proposal from Financial Sponsor C and the expressions of
interest received from Financial Sponsor A and other financial sponsors, as well as the progress of
Momentive’s strategic initiatives and cost-cutting initiatives. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners presented
a preliminary financial overview of the valuations for Momentive proposed by Financial Sponsor A and
Financial Sponsor C, as well as certain market perspectives on Momentive. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners reviewed various strategic acquirors and financial sponsors that Momentive might consider
contacting based on those parties’ likely or previously expressed interest in a potential strategic transaction
with Momentive as part of the 2021 solicitation process and following the termination of the Zendesk merger
agreement and their respective abilities to finance and consummate a transaction. The Strategic Committee
discussed timing and process considerations in an outreach process. The Strategic Committee also
discussed the potential risks
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of an outreach, including Momentive management and employee distraction and adverse impacts on
Momentive’s business and employee morale if a transaction was pursued but not consummated, and the
increase in the likelihood of those risks in a wider private or public process relative to a more targeted
outreach. The Strategic Committee expressed a belief that a wider process would not be necessary given
that Momentive’s interest in a potential acquisition would be widely known in light of the 2021 solicitation
process and recent media reports that Momentive was considering a sale. Following discussion, the
Strategic Committee (1) directed Qatalyst Partners to inform Financial Sponsor C that it needed to improve
the terms of its proposal; (2) determined to permit Financial Sponsor A to conduct additional due diligence in
order to provide a firm acquisition proposal; and (3) directed Qatalyst Partners to commence an outreach to
a group of other potential acquirers, to be selected by Ms. Decker in consultation with Qatalyst Partners
and based on the feedback received in the meeting. Following the meeting, based on Ms. Decker’s
consultation with Qatalyst Partners, 11 financial sponsors (which included Financial Sponsor B and
Financial Sponsor D, but did not include STG) and 4 potential strategic acquirors (which did not include
Zendesk or Strategic A) were designated to engage with as part of the outreach process, in addition to
Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C. Following the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners
contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor C to provide feedback on its proposal as directed by the
Strategic Committee. On that day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $7.46 per share.
Between October 21, 2022 and October 25, 2022, in accordance with the directive of the Strategic
Committee, representatives of Qatalyst Partners commenced their outreach to the 15 designated additional
potential counterparties. Over the subsequent two weeks, seven of the 15 additional counterparties entered
into a confidentiality agreement with Momentive, while eight of the additional counterparties did not enter into
a confidentiality agreement and declined to engage in discussions or due diligence with respect to a
potential transaction with Momentive. In addition, Momentive requested at this time that each of Financial
Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C enter into a new confidentiality agreement with Momentive in order to
extend the term of their respective confidentiality obligations and because the “standstill” provisions in their
original confidentiality agreements had terminated upon the announcement of the Zendesk merger
agreement. The new confidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor C also included the portfolio company
of Financial Sponsor C that was proposed as the entity that would acquire Momentive. All of these
confidentiality agreements described above, as well as the confidentiality agreements with the other
counterparties that made an unsolicited outreach to Momentive as described below, including the
confidentiality agreement subsequently entered into with STG, (1) contained “standstill” provisions restricting
the counterparty from making public proposals with respect to the acquisition of Momentive without
Momentive’s prior consent (but not restricting confidential proposals to the Momentive Board), which
restrictions would terminate upon the occurrence of, among other things, Momentive’s execution of a
definitive agreement with a third party to acquire more than 50% of Momentive’s outstanding voting
securities; and (2) restricted the counterparty’s ability to engage with equity or debt financing sources
regarding a potential transaction without Momentive’s prior consent. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners
updated the Strategic Committee on the status of their outreach to, and responses from, the 15 additional
counterparties.
On October 21, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor D contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners
to inform them they would be delivering an acquisition proposal reflecting a “standard” premium to
Momentive’s then-current market price. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners responded that they did not
believe that such a valuation would lead to engagement by Momentive with Financial Sponsor D, which
response was consistent with the feedback provided to Financial Sponsor C at the Strategic Committee’s
direction. Following this discussion, Financial Sponsor D delivered a written, non-binding proposal to acquire
Momentive at a price in cash of between $9.00 and $10.50 per share of Momentive common stock based on
publicly available information.
Also beginning on October 25, 2022 and over the course of the subsequent four weeks, Momentive provided
potential counterparties that had executed a confidentiality agreement, including the additional potential
counterparties that engaged with Momentive on an unsolicited basis following the initial outreach by
Qatalyst Partners, as described below, with access to a virtual data room to share operational and financial
due diligence information regarding Momentive. Over the course of the subsequent four weeks, Momentive
and its representatives also provided additional operational and financial due diligence information regarding

proposal at a premium of up to 50% to 75% to the unaffected price of Momentive common stock prior to
media reports on October 19, 2022 that Momentive was considering a sale. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners offered to provide STG with due diligence information regarding Momentive, which STG accepted.

On November 3, 2022, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive
management presented a draft long-range business plan for Momentive, including underlying assumptions,
business initiatives and other potential growth drivers, potential cost reduction initiatives and operating
margin expectations for Momentive’s business, as well as updates to reflect continuing headwinds in
Momentive’s business and industry and Momentive management’s expectations for deteriorations in
Momentive’s prospective operational and financial performance. The Momentive Board discussed with the
members of Momentive management the draft long-range plan, including the likelihood of achieving the
financial performance assumed in the plan in light of the headwinds and trends in Momentive’s industry and
business. The Momentive Board also discussed the possibility of focusing business initiatives and further
reducing costs to optimize Momentive’s planned growth and operating margins. Following discussion, the
Momentive Board requested that Momentive management prepare an updated version of the long-range plan
with revisions consistent with the discussion at the meeting. The Momentive Board also met in executive
session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss
these matters.
After the close of trading on November 3, 2022, Momentive held its earnings call to report third quarter
results for 2022, and provided financial guidance for fourth quarter and full year results for 2022. Momentive
common stock closed trading at a price of $7.71 per share on November 4, 2022.
On November 4, 2022, following an outreach by representatives of Qatalyst Partners, representatives of a
financial sponsor that Qatalyst Partners had initially contacted regarding a potential transaction on October
21, 2022 at the direction of the Strategic Committee (which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor H”),
indicated that, based on its review of preliminary due diligence information regarding Momentive, Financial
Sponsor H would be interested in a potential acquisition of Momentive at a price in cash of between $9.00
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and $10.00 per share of Momentive common stock, with the possibility of increasing its valuation based on

Lurie referred the representatives of Financial Sponsor I to Qatalyst Partners. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners subsequently contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor I to discuss its interest in a potential
strategic transaction, and Financial Sponsor I requested due diligence information regarding Momentive.
On November 9, 2022, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive
management presented Momentive management’s long-range plan for Momentive as updated based on
feedback from the directors at the prior meeting of the Momentive Board, including the unaudited prospective
financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 included in the updated long-range plan (which we
refer to as the “November 2022 long-range plan”). Additional information about the preparation and
substance of the November 2022 long-range plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” Following discussion, the Momentive Board
approved the November 2022 long-range plan and authorized sharing the November 2022 long-range plan
with potentially interested counterparties as part of their due diligence review of Momentive, and also with
Qatalyst Partners for use in its financial analyses. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided an update

valuation guidance that Qatalyst Partners would provide to potentially interested counterparties. The
Momentive Board also discussed various counterparties’ potential equity and debt financing capabilities in
the current market environment, and their respective capacity to consummate an acquisition of Momentive.
The Momentive Board also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of
Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters. The Momentive Board discussed the benefits
and considerations of pursuing a potential acquisition relative to Momentive’s standalone future prospects,
and how best to position Momentive’s business for execution of its business plan if a transaction was not
consummated. Following discussion, the Momentive Board directed Qatalyst Partners to continue the
ongoing solicitation process and discussions with potentially interested counterparties.

of Financial Sponsor D that it remained interested in a potential transaction but was not prepared to improve

Partners to inform them that Financial Sponsor C would pause its review of a potential acquisition of

representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with the potential counterparties as part of the outreach

acquisition proposals. Following discussion, the Strategic Committee authorized Qatalyst Partners to deliver
a process letter to the remaining potentially interested counterparties requesting that acquisition proposals
be submitted on December 16, 2022. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without
Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss
these matters. In executive session, based on outreaches from Momentive stockholders and potential future
shareholder activism, including the possibility of a proxy contest at Momentive’s 2023 annual meeting of
stockholders if a transaction was not announced, the Strategic Committee discussed whether to engage
Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to the Company in connection with potential shareholder
activism and the terms of a potential engagement. Following discussion, the Strategic Committee directed
Momentive management and Wilson Sonsini to negotiate an engagement letter with Qatalyst Partners to
serve as financial advisor to Momentive in connection with governance and shareholder activism matters
consistent with the terms discussed at the meeting.
On November 24, 2022, Momentive executed a confidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor G.
On November 28, 2022, Qatalyst Partners delivered process letters to each of the potentially interested

On December 7, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst

process, including (1) the distribution of the process letters; (2) the counterparties that had declined to
engage in further discussions with Momentive regarding a transaction to date, including Financial Sponsor D
and Financial Sponsor H; and (3) discussions with the remaining potentially interested counterparties and
the due diligence being conducted by those counterparties. The Strategic Committee discussed whether to
expand the outreach to additional counterparties. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that
contacting additional counterparties was not likely to result in additional acquisition proposals in light of
Momentive’s deteriorating business performance and the fact that Momentive’s interest in a potential sale
was widely known as a result of media reports. Momentive management provided an update on Momentive’s
business performance, including the trends and results for the fourth quarter 2022 to date, including
continued headwinds in Momentive’s business and industry and potential cost-cutting measures. The
Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of
Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters.
On December 13, 2022, following an outreach by representatives of Qatalyst Partners, representatives of
Financial Sponsor E declined to engage in further discussions with Momentive regarding a potential
acquisition following their review of due diligence information.
Also on December 13, 2022, following an outreach by representatives of Qatalyst Partners, representatives
of Financial Sponsor G declined to engage in further discussions with Momentive regarding a potential
acquisition following their continued review of due diligence information because Financial Sponsor G did not
believe it could submit an acquisition proposal that it believed was competitive.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 16, 2022, STG delivered a written, non-binding indication of interest to acquire Momentive at a
price in cash of $10.00 per share of Momentive common stock. The indication of interest included a
summary of STG’s estimated sources and uses of funds in the acquisition, and indicated that STG would
seek equity financing commitments from multiple unspecified third party limited partners of STG as co-
investors. The indication of interest included a request that Momentive agree to enter into exclusive
negotiations with STG with respect to a sale of Momentive through January 31, 2023. Over the course of the
subsequent two days, representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed STG’s estimated sources and uses of
funds with representatives of STG, and representatives of STG confirmed they were targeting the execution
and announcement of a potential acquisition by the end of January 2023.
As of December 16, 2022, all other potential counterparties that had engaged with Momentive with respect
to a potential strategic transaction as part of Momentive’s ongoing solicitation process (including Financial
Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor C, the 15 other additional potential acquirors Qatalyst Partners had contacted
between October 21, 2022 and October 25, 2022, and other potential counterparties that had contacted
Momentive following that time, as described above) had declined to engage in further discussions with
Momentive with respect to a potential acquisition or had otherwise not responded to Qatalyst Partners’
outreach. Momentive received no other indications of interest or proposals with respect to a strategic
transaction on December 16, 2022.
On December 16, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on the results of Momentive’s solicitation process to date, noting that STG was
the only remaining counterparty to have submitted an indication of interest or proposal with respect to a
strategic transaction at that time. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed STG’s indication of
interest, including STG’s proposed financing structure and its estimated sources and uses of funds in the
acquisition. The Strategic Committee discussed negotiation strategies to seek to improve STG’s proposal,
including the possibility of soliciting additional proposals to encourage a competitive bidding dynamic. The
Strategic Committee also discussed with its advisors financing and closing certainty risks in STG’s
proposed transaction, and timing and process considerations of a transaction with STG. Following
discussion, the Strategic Committee (1) determined to continue engaging with STG toward a potential
acquisition, including by providing additional due diligence information, discussed STG’s request to enter
into exclusive negotiations with STG with respect to a sale of Momentive, and declined to do so at this time,
and instructed Qatalyst Partners as part of this engagement to inform STG that Momentive was prepared to
proceed with discussions with respect to a potential transaction but that they were not prepared to transact
at a price below $10.50 per share of Momentive common stock; and (2) directed Qatalyst Partners to
contact to Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C to inform each of them that Momentive had
received a credible acquisition proposal and offer an opportunity to submit a competing proposal. The
Strategic Committee believed that Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C were the counterparties
potentially most likely to be interested in, and capable of, submitting a competitive acquisition proposal. The
Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of
Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters. Following the meeting, the Strategic Committee
updated the Momentive Board on the results of Momentive’s solicitation process to date and next steps.
Between December 18 and 21, 2022, in accordance with the directive of the Strategic Committee,
representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of STG to inform them that (1) Momentive
was prepared to proceed with discussions with respect to a potential transaction, including by providing
additional due diligence information, (2) was not prepared to agree to STG’s request for exclusivity, and (3)
was not prepared to transact at price below $10.50 per share. Representatives of STG responded that it was
prepared to move forward with additional diligence at $10.00 per share but could not commit to a higher
price. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners informed the members of the Strategic Committee of STG’s
response, including that STG indicated they were unable to commit to a higher price than $10.00 per share.
The Strategic Committee determined to proceed with discussions with STG on a non-exclusive basis,
toward a potential acquisition.
On December 20, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor
A to inform it that Momentive had received a credible acquisition proposal. Financial Sponsor A
subsequently declined again to engage in further discussions with Momentive regarding an acquisition.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on December 20, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Financial
Sponsor C to inform them that Momentive had received a credible acquisition proposal. Financial Sponsor C
responded that it was still not a good time for Financial Sponsor C to engage regarding a transaction, but
again requested that Qatalyst Partners inform them if Momentive was near an alternative transaction.
Beginning on December 23, 2022, representatives of STG and its advisors, including Paul Hastings LLP,
STG’s outside counsel (which we refer to as “Paul Hastings”), were granted access to additional
operational and legal due diligence documents and information regarding Momentive in its virtual data room
to support their confirmatory due diligence review of Momentive. Over the course of the following ten weeks,
STG and its advisors conducted operational, customer, financial, legal, employment, accounting and other
due diligence on Momentive, and from time to time met with members of Momentive management and its
advisors regarding the due diligence information.
On January 1, 2023, with the approval of the Strategic Committee, Momentive entered into an engagement
letter with Qatalyst Partners to act as a financial advisor to Momentive in connection with certain
shareholder activism and governance matters.
On January 12, 2023, representatives of STG contacted representatives of Qatalyst to request approval to
contact a group of STG’s limited partners to explore their interest in providing potential equity financing for a
transaction as co-investors with STG. The representatives of STG stated their belief that its limited partners
could provide sufficient equity financing, together with equity financing from funds affiliated with STG and
debt financing, to finance the transaction.
On January 13, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on STG’s due diligence review, and noted that STG would likely require
additional time to complete its due diligence and arrange its financing for a transaction, including engaging
with its limited partners as potential co-investors. The Strategic Committee discussed timing and process
considerations, and authorized STG to engage with additional debt and equity financing sources in
connection with finalizing its acquisition proposal and executing a potential transaction. Members of
Momentive management provided an update on Momentive’s business performance, including the trends and
results for the fourth quarter 2022 and for first quarter of 2023 to date, and discussed (1) deviations in the
billings and operating margin results for these periods relative to the November 2022 long-range plan and
previously disclosed financial and operational guidance; and (2) the possibility of implementing a cost and
workforce reduction plan in response to these trends. The Strategic Committee discussed with Momentive
management whether to it would be necessary to update its earnings guidance to be delivered during its
earnings call to report fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 and revise the November 2022 long-range
plan based on these recent trends and results. The Strategic Committee also discussed the anticipated
timing of executing and announcing a transaction relative to Momentive’s earnings call to report fourth
quarter and full year results for 2022. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without
Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters.
Later on January 13, 2023, Momentive approved STG engaging with a group of its third party limited partners
as potential equity financing sources and co-investors with respect to the financing of a potential acquisition
of Momentive. Certain of the limited partners were also provided access to Momentive’s virtual data room at
the limited partners’ request. Under the confidentiality agreement between Momentive and STG, STG would
be responsible for any violation of non-use or non-disclosure obligations with respect to Momentive’s non-
public information by its prospective financing sources.
On January 15, 2023, in the interest of creating a competitive dynamic, representatives of Qatalyst Partners
contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor C to provide them information on Momentive’s fourth quarter
financial and operating results. The outreach did not result in further engagement by Financial Sponsor C
with Momentive.
On January 18, 2023, Wilson Sonsini provided a draft of the merger agreement to representatives of STG,
including Paul Hastings.
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 19, 2023, representatives of Wilson Sonsini contacted representatives of Paul Hastings to
provide an overview of the draft of the merger agreement. During the discussion, representatives of Paul
Hastings stated that STG requested that Momentive’s directors execute a voting agreement committing to
vote, in their capacity as Momentive stockholders, in favor of the merger.
On January 25, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with STG, including the status of STG’s due diligence review of
Momentive and efforts to secure financing commitments for the transaction. The Strategic Committee
discussed the anticipated timing of executing and announcing a transaction relative to Momentive’s
upcoming earnings call, including the risk that the announcement of Momentive’s fourth quarter and full year
2022 results might result in volatility in the price of Momentive common stock and jeopardize the execution
of a potential transaction. Following discussion, the Strategic Committee directed Momentive management
to schedule the earnings call for February 16, 2023. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session,
without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these
matters.
On January 30, 2023, Momentive announced that it would hold its earnings call to report fourth quarter and
full year results for 2022 on February 16, 2023.
On January 31, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of STG to obtain an
update on STG’s due diligence review and timing and process expectations with respect to a potential
transaction. Qatalyst Partners, at the direction of the Strategic Committee, indicated that Momentive wanted
to target the execution and announcement of a potential transaction on or before the upcoming
announcement of Momentive’s earnings results on February 16, 2023. Representatives of STG indicated that
STG’s due diligence was proceeding as planned. Representatives of STG also indicated that they expected
the transaction to be reviewed by STG’s investment committee within the next week, and confirmed that
STG was working with its third party limited partners necessary to secure equity financing commitments for
the transaction.
On February 1, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with STG, including the status of STG’s due diligence review of
Momentive, investment committee approval and efforts to secure financing commitments for the transaction.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted that representatives of STG had expressed confidence they
would secure the necessary equity financing commitments from STG’s limited partner co-investors. The
Strategic Committee discussed with members of Momentive management its views on a potential cost and
workforce reduction plan. The Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive
management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters.
On February 3, 2023, representatives of STG confirmed to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that STG’s
investment committee had reviewed the potential transaction and approved continuing to work toward the
execution of a transaction.
On February 4, 2023, representatives of STG contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform them
that STG’s limited partners were still working to finalize their respective equity financing commitments, and
that STG was working with each of them to have their respective investment committees provide final
approval for the equity financing commitments by February 14, 2023.
Also on February 4, 2023, at the request of STG, Momentive approved STG engaging with certain additional
potential debt financing sources with respect to the financing of a potential acquisition of Momentive.
On February 7, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with STG, including the status of STG’s investment committee
approval and efforts to secure financing commitments for the transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners noted that STG had indicated that it had received investment committee support to proceed with an
acquisition at $10.00 in cash per share. The Strategic Committee discussed with representatives of Qatalyst
Partners STG’s potential sources of funds for an acquisition of Momentive, including potential equity

TABLE OF CONTENTS
financing commitments from STG’s existing funds and from STG’s limited partners as potential co-investors,
potential debt financing commitments and Momentive’s estimated available cash on hand at the closing;
based on these discussions and the continued deterioration of Momentive’s business and financial
performance, it was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that STG would likely not be able to improve
its proposed purchase price above $10.00 per share of Momentive common stock. The Strategic Committee
discussed timing considerations for executing a potential acquisition with STG, noting that the timeline for a
transaction would be contingent on finalizing the terms of the merger agreement and the equity financing
commitments. The Strategic Committee also discussed the anticipated timing of executing and announcing
a transaction relative to Momentive’s upcoming earnings call on February 16, 2023. Members of Momentive
management discussed trends and results for the fourth quarter 2022 and for first quarter of 2023 to date, as
well as Momentive management expectations for business and financial performance in the first quarter and
full year 2023 based on these trends relative to the November 2022 long-range plan and Momentive’s
previously disclosed financial and operational guidance. Members of Momentive management discussed the
possibility of implementing a cost and workforce reduction plan in response to these trends. The Strategic
Committee discussed with Momentive management whether it would be necessary to update its guidance to
be delivered during its upcoming earnings call and update Momentive’s long-range plan based on these
expectations. The Strategic Committee requested that Momentive management present to the Momentive
Board on these topics, including scenarios for operational adjustments and cost reductions. The Strategic
Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst
Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters.
Also on February 7, 2023, at the request of STG, Momentive approved STG engaging with one additional
third party limited partner as a potential equity financing source.
On February 8, 2023, Paul Hastings sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Wilson Sonsini, as well
as initial drafts of the equity commitment letter and Limited Guaranty. Over the subsequent month and prior
to the execution of the merger agreement, representatives of Momentive and STG and their respective legal
advisors exchanged drafts and negotiated the terms of the merger agreement, equity commitment letter and
Limited Guaranty. Key terms of the merger agreement negotiated between the parties included: (1) STG’s
proposed equity financing structure for the acquisition, including whether Parent’s equity financing
commitments for the transaction would be provided entirely by funds affiliated with STG or would also be
provided by certain of STG’s limited partners as co-investors; (2) the terms of Parent’s obligations with
respect to the completion of the equity financing and debt financing necessary to complete the acquisition,
and Momentive’s obligations to cooperate with Parent to complete the debt financing; (3) the terms and
conditions of the equity financing sources’ obligations to fund the equity financing commitments under the
equity commitment letter; (4) Momentive’s recourse in the event of a financing failure, including the
circumstances in which Momentive could require Parent to seek to enforce the financing commitments or
Momentive could seek to enforce the equity financing commitments directly under the equity commitment
letter, the size of the termination fee payable by Parent and the circumstances in which it would be payable,
and whether the payment of the termination fee would be guaranteed under the Limited Guaranty entirely by
funds affiliated with STG or would be allocated proportionally among all of Parent’s equity financing sources;
(5) the terms of the no-shop restrictions applicable to Momentive, the circumstances in which Momentive
could negotiate or accept a superior proposal; (6) the amount of the termination fee payable by Momentive
and the circumstances in which it would be payable; (7) the conditions to each party’s obligations to
complete the merger; (8) the termination date and the circumstances in which the parties could terminate
the merger agreement, as well as the limitation of the parties’ liability in the event the merger agreement was
terminated; (9) the circumstances in which the equity commitment letter and the Limited Guaranty would
terminate; and (10) the interim operating covenants applicable to Momentive prior to the closing of the
merger and related exceptions for matters such as Momentive’s 2023 annual equity award refresh grant,
other employee compensation and retention, and entry by Momentive into new material contracts.
Also on February 8, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. Members of Momentive management discussed with the
Strategic Committee (1) the trends and deteriorating results in Momentive’s business for the fourth quarter
2022 and for first quarter of 2023 to date, (2) deviations in billings and operating margin results relative to the
November 2022 long-range plan and Momentive’s previously disclosed financial and operational guidance, (3)
Momentive management’s expectations for further deteriorations in Momentive’s business and financial

TABLE OF CONTENTS
performance for 2023, including scenarios for implementing a workforce reduction plan and other operational
and cost-cutting adjustments. The Strategic Committee requested that Momentive management further
develop its views on these topics, including expectations for Momentive’s performance through 2026, and
present Momentive management’s views to the Momentive Board on these topics.
On February 12, 2023, Wilson Sonsini sent an initial draft of the voting agreement to Paul Hastings. Over
the subsequent month and prior to the execution of the merger agreement, representatives of Momentive
and STG and their respective legal advisors exchanged drafts and negotiated the terms of the voting
agreement. Key terms of the voting agreement negotiated between the parties included the terms of the
voting commitments applicable to the voting agreement stockholders, and the circumstances in which the
transfer restrictions and voting commitments applicable to the voting agreement parties would terminate.
On February 13, 2023, representatives of STG contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Mr. Lurie
to provide them with an update on their efforts to secure equity and debt financing commitments for the
transaction.
On February 14, 2023, representatives of STG contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners to inform them
that certain of the limited partner co-investors required additional time to obtain approval of their potential
financing commitments, and Parent would not be in a position to finalize its financing commitments prior to
Momentive’s scheduled earnings call on February 16, 2023.
Also on February 14, 2023, a representative of a financial advisor contacted Mr. Lurie and Ms. Decker to
inform them that a financial sponsor (which we refer to as “Financial Sponsor J”) had expressed interest in
a potential acquisition of Momentive. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners, in accordance with the direction
of the Strategic Committee, contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor J to discuss their interest in
Momentive.
On February 15, 2023, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on discussions with STG, including the status of STG’s efforts to secure
financing commitments for the transaction and the fact that STG had confirmed it had not yet finalized its
financing commitments. The Momentive Board discussed timing considerations for executing a potential
acquisition with STG, noting that the timeline for a transaction would be contingent on STG finalizing its
financing commitments. The Momentive Board discussed with representatives of Qatalyst Partners STG’s
potential sources of funds for an acquisition of Momentive; based on these discussions and the continued
deterioration of Momentive’s business and financial performance, it was the consensus of the Momentive
Board that STG would likely not be able to improve its proposed purchase price above $10.00 per share of
Momentive common stock. The Momentive Board discussed with its advisors STG’s proposed equity
financing structure and related financing and closing certainty risks, as well as the terms being negotiated to
mitigate these risks, including Momentive’s ability to enforce the equity financing commitments directly
under the equity commitment letter and the size and source of the Parent termination fee. Members of
Momentive management presented (1) the trends and results in Momentive’s business for the fourth quarter
2022 and for first quarter of 2023 to date, (2) deviations in billings and operating margin results relative to the
November 2022 long-range plan and Momentive’s previously disclosed financial and operational guidance, (3)
Momentive management’s expectations for deteriorations in Momentive’s prospective business and financial
performance through 2026, including scenarios for implementing a workforce reduction plan and other
operational and cost-cutting adjustments. Mr. Lurie noted his belief that the implementation of a workforce
reduction plan would be in the best interests of Momentive and its stockholders as an independent entity.
The Momentive Board discussed these matters and various scenarios for implementing and announcing a
workforce reduction plan, including stockholder reactions and the potential impact on discussions and
negotiations with STG. Following discussion, the Momentive Board approved the implementation of the
workforce reduction plan, to be announced and initiated in connection with Momentive’s earnings call
scheduled for the next day. The Momentive Board also approved Momentive management providing financial
and operational guidance for the first quarter of 2023 on the earnings call to reflect Momentive
management’s revised expectations for Momentive’s business performance and the implementation of the
workforce reduction plan, and requested that Momentive management prepare and present at a subsequent
meeting of the Momentive Board an updated version of long-range plan for Momentive to account for these
matters.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
After the close of trading on February 16, 2023, Momentive held its earnings call to report fourth quarter and

Following Momentive’s earnings call, between February 19, 2023 and February 28, 2023, members of
Momentive management met with representatives of STG to discuss the workforce reduction plan and the
updated first quarter financial guidance announced by Momentive on its earnings call. Representatives of
STG indicated that STG’s limited partners would need to review these updates with their investment
committees before confirming their potential equity financing commitments.
On February 21, 2023, representatives of Financial Sponsor J contacted representatives of Qatalyst
Partners to inform them that Financial Sponsor J was declining to engage in discussions with Momentive

the speed and certainty to match Momentive’s ongoing solicitation process.
On February 24, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Wilson

Sonsini and members of Momentive management also provided an update on the negotiations with STG
regarding exceptions to the interim operating covenants under the merger agreement for employee

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On March 5, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of STG to obtain an
update on Parent’s efforts to secure financing commitments. In connection with that discussion,
representatives of STG sent representatives of Qatalyst Partners a schedule of its detailed illustrative,
estimated sources and uses of funds in the merger, which schedule assumed that Parent would pay $10.00
per share of Momentive common stock as consideration in the merger.
On March 6, 2023, representatives of STG informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they expected
the limited partner co-investors would seek approval of their potential equity financing commitments from
their respective investment committees within the next two days.
On March 7, 2023, representatives of STG communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that
certain limited partner co-investors had determined not to proceed with an equity commitment in Parent, and
that considering (1) the prevailing business trends relating to Momentive, including as publicly disclosed in
Momentive’s updated public guidance, (2) the remaining potential equity financing amounts and the
anticipated debt financing amounts available for a potential transaction, together with Momentive’s estimated
available cash on hand at the closing; (3) the estimated capitalization of Momentive at closing (including
equity awards proposed to be issued by Momentive as part of its 2023 annual refresh grant prior to the
closing) and the aggregate amount of consideration estimated to be payable by Parent in the merger; and
(4) the other anticipated uses of funds in the merger, including the repayment of Momentive’s outstanding
debt and estimated transaction expenses, Parent would only have the capacity to pay a purchase price of
$9.20 in cash per share of Momentive common stock in an acquisition. Following this discussion, STG
delivered a revised written proposal to acquire Momentive at a purchase price of $9.20 in cash per share of
Momentive common stock.
Later on March 7, 2023, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive
management presented a draft updated long-range plan for Momentive to reflect headwinds and trends in
Momentive’s industry and business and the implementation of the workforce reduction plan, which members
of Momentive management characterized as an “upside” case for Momentive’s near-term billings growth. In
reviewing the long-range plan presented at the meeting, the Momentive Board discussed with Momentive
management and considered, among other factors, Momentive management’s view that achieving the
results indicated by the plan was subject to significant execution risks in light of the headwinds and trends
in Momentive’s industry and business, the trends in Momentive’s industry and business that needed to
improve in the near-term in order to achieve the plan, and Momentive’s recent track record of achieving
publicly disclosed operating and financial guidance in the context of uncertain market conditions. Following
discussion, the Momentive Board requested that Momentive management prepare and present to the
Momentive Board an updated plan with alternative scenarios for billings growth that Momentive management
had more confidence in achieving. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also provided an update on
discussions with STG, including the revised acquisition proposal received that day and the status of
Parent’s efforts to secure financing commitments for the merger. The Momentive Board also discussed the
amount and terms of equity awards proposed to be issued by Momentive as part of its 2023 annual refresh
grant prior to the closing, as well as other exceptions to the interim operating covenants under the merger
agreement for employee compensation and retention matters. The Momentive Board also met in executive
session, without Momentive management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and
continued to discuss these matters. Following discussion, the Momentive Board directed Qatalyst Partners
to continue to negotiate the acquisition price of the merger with STG.
On March 8, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed with representatives of STG its
assumptions and estimates with respect to sources and uses of funds in the merger, including revisions to
the amounts of Momentive’s estimated available cash on hand at the closing and the estimated transaction
expenses, and the impact of such revisions on Parent’s capacity to pay an increased purchase price per
share in the merger. Following this discussion, STG delivered a revised written proposal to acquire
Momentive at a purchase price of $9.35 in cash per share of Momentive common stock. In addition,
representatives of STG indicated that STG might have capacity to further increase its purchase price if
Momentive issued less equity awards as part of its 2023 annual refresh grant prior to the closing.
On March 9, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Partners provided an update on discussions with STG, including the revised acquisition proposal received
the prior day and the status of Parent’s efforts to secure financing commitments for the merger, as well the
remaining potential equity co-investors STG proposed to include in the consortium. Representatives of
Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the negotiation of the merger agreement and related transaction
documents. The Strategic Committee discussed with its advisors (1) the execution risks presented by
STG’s proposed transaction financing structure; (2) the terms of the merger agreement and related
transaction documents as they related to financing and closing certainty; and (3) Momentive’s rights with
respect to the enforcement of the financing commitments and Momentive’s remedies in the event of a
financing failure. The Strategic Committee discussed the amount and terms of equity awards proposed to be
issued by Momentive as part of its 2023 annual refresh grant prior to the closing, and other employee
compensation and retention matters, and how to optimize the possibility of obtaining an improved
acquisition proposal from STG relative to employee retention and incentive objectives prior to the closing of a
potential transaction and in the event a transaction was not ultimately consummated. Following discussion,
the Strategic Committee directed Qatalyst Partners, Wilson Sonsini and Momentive management to
continue to negotiate the terms of the merger, including the acquisition price and the terms related to
financing and closing certainty. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that Momentive should
propose to issue a reduced amount of equity awards and retention bonuses to prior to the closing and seek
an improved acquisition proposal from STG.
Later on March 9, 2023, in accordance with the direction of the Strategic Committee, representatives of
Qatalyst Partners communicated to representatives of STG Momentive’s proposed amount and terms of
equity awards and retention bonuses to be issued by Momentive prior to the closing consistent with the
direction of the Strategic Committee and requested an improved acquisition proposal. In response, STG
requested to increase the amount of equity awards and retention bonuses to be issued by Momentive prior
to closing for employee retention purposes but also indicated that, based on the proposed net reduction in
the amount of equity awards and retention bonuses to be issued, Parent would have the capacity to pay a
purchase price of $9.45 in cash per share of Momentive common stock in an acquisition. Representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Wilson Sonsini also continued to negotiate the terms of the merger with
representatives of STG consistent with the direction of the Strategic Committee, including the conditions
and other terms of the equity financing sources’ obligations to complete their respective equity financing
commitments and the size of the Parent termination fee.
Still later on March 9, 2023, representatives of Qatalyst Partners noted to representatives of STG that,
based on their calculations of the sources and uses of funds in the merger and the reduction in the amount
of equity awards and retention bonuses proposed by Momentive to be issued prior to the closing, Parent
would have the capacity to pay a purchase price of $9.46 per share of Momentive common stock in an
acquisition. STG agreed with Qatalyst Partner’s calculations, and orally increased its proposal to acquire
Momentive at a purchase price of $9.46 in cash per share of Momentive common stock.
On March 10, 2023, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Members of Momentive
management presented an updated long-range plan for Momentive, including revisions relative to the draft
plan presented at the prior meeting of the Momentive Board based on the feedback of the Momentive
directors (which we refer to as the “March 2023 long-range plan”). Additional information about the
preparation and substance of the March 2023 long-range plan is contained in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” The Momentive Board discussed the
updates to the long-range plan with members of Momentive management, including Momentive
management’s increased confidence in the achievability of the results indicated by the March 2023 long-
range plan in the near-term and long-term in light of current and anticipated headwinds and trends in
Momentive’s industry and business. Following discussion, the Momentive Board approved the March 2023
long-range plan, including for purposes of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses, and authorized Qatalyst
Partners to share a summary of the March 2023 long-range plan with STG. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners and representatives of Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the negotiations and discussions with
STG, including the status of Parent’s efforts to secure financing commitments and the terms of Parent’s
financing commitments and Momentive’s rights with respect thereto. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners
noted that, based on the amount of Parent’s anticipated financing commitments and the estimated sources
and uses of funds in the merger, Parent would not have the capacity to pay a purchase price of more than
$9.46 in cash per share of Momentive common stock in an acquisition. The Momentive Board discussed
with
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Wilson Sonsini potential Momentive stockholder reactions to the
announcement of the merger. The Momentive Board also met in executive session, without Momentive
management or representatives of Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters.
Following discussion, the Momentive Board authorized representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst
Partners and members of Momentive management to continue negotiating the terms of the merger with
STG. Following the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided STG with a summary of the
March 2023 long-range plan.
Also on March 10, 2023, Momentive received a notice from a stockholder nominating a candidate for
election to the Momentive Board at Momentive’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders.
On March 11, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners reviewed the process to solicit proposals conducted by Momentive to date. Representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the negotiations and discussions with STG,
including the status of Parent’s efforts to secure financing commitments for the merger. In particular,
representatives of Wilson Sonsini noted that the negotiation of the merger agreement and related transaction
documents was substantially complete, in accordance with the terms previously discussed with the
Strategic Committee and the Momentive Board, but that the execution of the merger agreement remained
subject to the finalization of Parent’s financing commitments. The Strategic Committee discussed the
impact of contemporaneous events with respect to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and disruption in the
U.S. banking sector on Parent’s ability to finalize its financing commitments and execute the merger. The
Strategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of
Qatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters. Following discussion, the
Strategic Committee directed representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Momentive management to finalize the
forms of the merger agreement and confirm that Parent’s financing commitments had been finalized. The
Strategic Committee also determined to recommend to the Momentive Board that it adopt and approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.
On March 12, 2023, representatives of STG communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that, in
light of disruption in the U.S. banking sector and related uncertainty, certain members of the equity
investment consortium and the debt financing sources would not be in a position to confirm their respective
financing commitments until they observed the market reactions to these events on March 13, 2023, and
therefore Parent was not in a position to finalize and execute the merger agreement on March 12, 2023.
Later on March 12, 2023, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners provided an update on the negotiations and discussions with STG, including the fact that Parent’s
financing commitments were not expected to be finalized that day. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners
also reviewed the process to solicit proposals conducted by Momentive to date, in which Momentive, with
the assistance of Qatalyst Partners, had engaged in discussions with 22 potential counterparties,
consisting of 18 financial sponsors and four potential strategic acquirors, 14 of which had entered into
confidentiality agreements with Momentive and conducted due diligence, and that had resulted only in the
proposal from Parent at that time. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also presented to the Momentive
Board their financial analysis of the per share price and related financial aspects of the merger.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated they would be prepared to deliver a written opinion, based on
the financial analysis presented at the meeting, that the per share price would be fair, from a financial point
of view, to the Momentive stockholders if and when requested by the Momentive Board prior to the execution
of the merger agreement within the next day. The Strategic Committee delivered its recommendation that
the Momentive Board adopt and approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of
the Momentive Board relevant Delaware law matters, including the directors’ fiduciary duties in connection
with the merger. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini also reviewed with the Momentive Board the principal
terms of the merger agreement, the voting agreements, the equity commitment letter and the other
transaction documents. The Momentive Board also received from Qatalyst Partners an updated conflict
disclosure letter, from which the Momentive Board did not identify matters that would limit Qatalyst Partner’s
ability to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to Momentive. In its review of the merger, the
Momentive Board
60
TABLE OF CONTENTS
considered various factors, including those described in the section titled “-Momentive’s Reasons for
the Merger and Recommendation of the Momentive Board of Directors.” The Momentive Board directed
representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Momentive management to finalize the forms of the merger agreement
and related transaction documents.
On March 13, 2023, representatives of Paul Hastings provided representatives of Wilson Sonsini an updated
version of the debt commitment letter and related documents reflecting revised lending terms, and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Paul Hastings and members of Momentive management
confirmed that the forms of the merger agreement, voting agreements and related transaction documents
were final and that Parent had finalized its financing commitments for the merger.
Later on March 13, 2023, during the trading and prior to the Momentive Board’s approval of the merger
agreement, upon the request of the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners delivered to the Momentive Board
its written opinion, stating that based on conditions as of March 12, 2023 and the financial analysis
presented to the Momentive Board on March 12, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various other
assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, that the per share price to be
received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger by the holders of Momentive common
stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The
written opinion was revised by Qatalyst Partners following the execution of the merger agreement to be in
the form attached to this proxy statement as Annex B to correct a scrivener’s error and to remove
confidential identifying information with respect to the members of the equity investment consortium.
Momentive management also updated the Momentive Board on the discussions with STG and its
representatives.
After the close of trading on March 13, 2023, the Momentive Board unanimously determined that the merger
agreement and the merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Momentive and its
stockholders, and declared advisable, adopted and approved in all respects the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and approved the execution and
delivery of the merger agreement, the voting agreements the other relevant transaction documents.
Still later on March 13, 2023, the merger agreement, voting agreements and related transaction documents
were executed by the relevant parties, and Momentive publicly announced the merger and the execution of
the merger agreement.
Also on March 13, 2023, following the announcement of the merger, Momentive received a notice
withdrawing the nomination of a director candidate for election that had been submitted on March 10, 2023.",46,68

Recommendation of the Momentive Board
On March 13, 2023, the Momentive Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
Momentive and its stockholders; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by
Momentive, the performance by Momentive of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the
consummation of the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (3)
recommended that Momentive stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby; and (4) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted for
consideration by Momentive stockholders at the special meeting.
The Momentive Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by
Momentive to its named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of
the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special
meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Momentive Board consulted with Momentive
management, as well as representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners. In recommending
that Momentive stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger,
61TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Momentive Board considered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors
are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations
and analyses, as well as the factors discussed below, the Momentive Board concluded that entering into the
merger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Momentive and its stockholders.
The Momentive Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination
and recommendation:
•
Business, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The Momentive Board considered
the current and historical financial condition, results of operations, business and competitive
positioning of Momentive, as well as Momentive’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an
positioning of Momentive, as well as Momentive’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an
independent company. In particular, the Momentive Board considered Momentive’s then-current
business plan, including the March 2023 long-range plan. Additional information about the
preparation and substance of the March 2023 long-range plan is contained in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” The Momentive Board
considered the March 2023 long-range plan and the potential opportunities that it presented
against, among other things, various execution and other risks to achieving Momentive’s business
plan, including (1) the likelihood that the financial and operational results indicated by the March
2023 long-range plan could be achieved in the face of operational and execution risks in the short
and long term; (2) the impact of market, industry, customer and competitive trends on, and
headwinds to, Momentive’s business; and (3) market volatility and the general risks related to
market and industry conditions that could reduce the price of Momentive common stock. Among
the potential risks identified by the Momentive Board were:
○
Momentive’s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included
among these risks were consideration of (1) Momentive’s size, as well as its
financial resources, relative to those of its competitors; (2) challenges to attracting and
retaining sales-assisted and other customers, converting unpaid users to customers, and
developing and expanding relationships with customers; (3) challenges to hiring and retaining
key personnel critical to the execution of Momentive’s business plan; (4) new and
evolving competitive threats, particularly in light of relatively low barriers to entry into our
business; and (5) other factors affecting the revenues, operating margin and profitability of
Momentive and other companies in Momentive’s industry generally and other risk factors
described in Momentive’s other filings with the SEC, as listed in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
○
Momentive’s continuing efforts to execute growth initiatives to (1) convert free users to paid
subscribers in its self-serve channel; and (2) invest in product innovation and go-to-
market initiatives to expand the percentage of Momentive’s revenue generated through its
sales-assisted channel. Although the Momentive Board believes that these actions are the
right strategic decisions for Momentive, there is no assurance that they will be successful or
result in a more valuable company. In this regard, the Momentive Board was aware that
Momentive’s sales-assisted channel faced greater costs, longer sales cycles and less
predictability in generating revenue than its self-serve channel.
○
Recent market volatility and evolving trends and headwinds facing Momentive’s business and
its industry more generally, including the impact of changed and uncertain
economic circumstances on key customer segments and the continuing effect of these
factors on Momentive and the execution of Momentive’s plans as an independent public
company.
○
Momentive’s history of fluctuations in revenue growth and the challenges to maintaining
operating margins in the near term, along with evolving investor expectations regarding
growth and profitability at technology companies.
○
The challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly
traded company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance.
The Momentive Board was aware that the price of Momentive common stock could be
negatively impacted if Momentive failed to meet investor expectations, including if Momentive
failed to meet its growth or profitability objectives.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
○
The inherent uncertainty of achieving the results reflected in the March 2023 long-range plan.
○
The historical execution of Momentive’s business plan and publicly disclosed guidance by
Momentive management. In this regard, the Momentive Board was aware of instances in
which Momentive failed to achieve certain expectations of Momentive’s financial and
operational performance, and of the impact that these failures had on the price of the
Momentive common stock.
○
The historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of
Momentive common stock.
•
Results of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of a comprehensive strategic
review process overseen by the Strategic Committee. The Momentive Board considered that, with
the assistance of Qatalyst Partners, Momentive contacted four potential strategic acquirors and 18
financial sponsors (including STG) concerning their interest in a strategic transaction involving
Momentive. The Momentive Board considered the nature of the engagement by each of these
potential acquirors, and that, of these potential acquirors, only STG made a proposal for an
acquisition of Momentive that was capable of being accepted. The Momentive Board was also
aware that the 2021 solicitation process had attracted considerable media attention and made
clear that the Momentive Board would consider a potential sale of Momentive and other transaction
that maximized stockholder value. Further, the Momentive Board noted that media reports that
Momentive was pursuing a potential sale prompted numerous unsolicited expressions of interest in
pursuing a potential acquisition of Momentive, but that none of these expressions of interest had
resulted in a proposal that was capable of being accepted.
•
Cash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by Momentive
stockholders in the merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured
against the ongoing business and financial execution risks of Momentive’s business plan. The
receipt of cash consideration eliminates uncertainty and risk for Momentive stockholders related to
the continued execution of Momentive’s business.
•
Best Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Momentive Board that the per share price
represents the best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of Momentive common stock, taking
into account the Momentive Board’s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business
strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Momentive on a historical and
prospective basis. In addition, the Momentive Board believed that, measured against Momentive’s
longer-term execution risks, the per share price reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of
Momentive common stock. The Momentive Board also considered that the per share price
constitutes a premium of approximately 28 percent to the volume weighted average closing price of
Momentive stock for the 10 trading days ending on March 13, 2023, the date the merger agreement
was executed, and a 46 percent premium to Momentive’s closing stock price on October 18, 2022,
the day prior to media rumors regarding a potential sale. The Momentive Board also considered
that the per share price represented the highest price that STG said Parent was capable of paying
in an acquisition of Momentive.
•
Potential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Momentive Board that none of the possible
alternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate Momentive as an
independent public company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived
risks of those alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to Momentive stockholders of
those alternatives and the timing and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely
to present superior opportunities for Momentive to create greater value for Momentive stockholders,
taking into account execution risks as well as business, competitive, financial, industry, legal,
market and regulatory risks.
•
Fairness Opinion of Qatalyst Partners. The written opinion of Qatalyst Partners delivered to the
Momentive Board, stating that based on conditions as of March 12, 2023 and the financial analysis
presented to the Momentive Board on March 12, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various
other assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, that the per share
price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger by the holders of
63
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) is fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP” and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B
to this proxy statement.
•
Negotiations with Parent and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement
and related transaction documents, which were the product of arms’-length negotiations, and the
belief of the Momentive Board that these agreements contained terms that provided Momentive with
a high level of closing certainty. The factors considered included:
○
Momentive’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct
negotiations with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.
○
The Momentive Board’s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to
deter third parties from making a superior proposal.
○
The Momentive Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its
recommendation that Momentive stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement.
○
Momentive’s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter
into an alternative acquisition agreement. In that regard, the Momentive Board believed that the
termination fee payable by Momentive in such instance was reasonable, consistent
with similar fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.
○
The limited conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the merger, making the merger
reasonably likely to be consummated.
○
Parent’s obligations under the merger agreement to complete the equity financing and debt
financing necessary to fund the merger. 
○
The limited conditions to the obligations of the investment consortium led by STG to fund their
respective equity financing commitments under the equity commitment letter.
○
Momentive’s recourse in the event of a financing failure, including Momentive’s ability (1) to
specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded or
to specifically enforce the equity financing commitments directly under the equity
commitment letter in the circumstances specified in the merger agreement and the equity
commitment letter; or (2) to collect the Parent termination fee in the circumstances specified
in the merger agreement and the Limited Guaranty. In that regard, the Momentive Board
believed that the Parent termination fee, which was guaranteed by funds affiliated with STG,
was consistent with similar fees payable in comparable transactions.
•
Reasonable Likelihood of Consummation. The belief of the Momentive Board that an acquisition by
Parent has a reasonable likelihood of closing, including the Momentive Board’s belief that there
was a reasonable likelihood that the regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger
would be obtained.
•
Appraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to Momentive
stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of Momentive common stock) who timely and
properly exercise such appraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.
The Momentive Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative
factors related to its recommendation, including the following:
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash
transaction means that Momentive stockholders will not participate in Momentive’s future earnings
or growth and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation following the
merger, whether as an independent company or in combination with other STG portfolio companies
or assets. The Momentive Board also considered the other potential alternative strategies available
to Momentive as an independent company, which, despite significant uncertainty, had the potential
to result in a more successful and valuable company.
64
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
No Ability to Solicit an Alternative Transaction. The restrictions in the merger agreement on
Momentive’s ability to solicit competing proposals from the date of the merger agreement (subject
to certain exceptions to allow the Momentive Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a
superior proposal, and then only upon the payment of the termination fee described below).
•
Financing Risks. The need for Parent to obtain debt financing, and equity financing from a
consortium of co-investors, in order to complete the merger. In that regard, the Momentive Board
was aware that Parent’s need to obtain equity financing commitments from a consortium of co-
investors could give rise to a greater possibility of a financing failure.
•
Termination Fee Payable by Momentive. The requirement that Momentive pay Parent a termination
fee of $52.0 million under certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement,
including if the Momentive Board terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal.
The Momentive Board considered the potentially dampening effect that this termination fee could
have on a third party’s interest in making a proposal to acquire Momentive.
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not
be consummated, and, if it is not consummated, that: (1) Momentive’s directors, senior
management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have
experienced significant distractions from their work on behalf of Momentive during the pendency of
the merger; (2) Momentive will have incurred significant transaction and other costs; (3)
Momentive’s continuing business relationships with customers, business partners and employees
may be adversely affected; (4) the trading price of Momentive common stock could be adversely
affected; (5) the other contractual and legal remedies available to Momentive in the event of the
termination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or both; and (6) the
failure of the merger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among Momentive’s
current and prospective customers, employees and investors, which could cause an adverse
impact on Momentive’s operating results. In this regard, the Momentive Board was aware of the
significant impact of the failure of the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement on Momentive
and its business.
•
Parent Liability Limitation. The fact that Parent’s liability for monetary damages under the merger
agreement are limited to the Parent liability limitation, which amount may not be sufficient to
compensate Momentive for the adverse impacts of the failure of the merger to be consummated.
•
Impact of Interim Restrictions on Momentive’s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger.
The restrictions on Momentive’s conduct of its business prior to the consummation of the merger,
which may delay or prevent Momentive from undertaking strategic initiatives before the completion
of the merger that, absent the merger agreement, Momentive might have pursued.
•
Effects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger,
including the: (1) effects on Momentive’s employees, customers, operating results and stock price;
(2) impact on Momentive’s ability to attract and retain management, sales and marketing and
technical personnel; and (3) potential for litigation in connection with the merger.
•
Taxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Momentive common stock in
the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for many Momentive
stockholders.
•
Interests of Momentive’s Directors and Executive Officers. Interests that Momentive’s directors and
executive officers may have in the merger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of
Momentive other stockholders.
This discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors
evaluated by the Momentive Board in its consideration of the merger. After considering these and other
factors, the Momentive Board concluded that the potential benefits of entering into the merger agreement
outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In light of the variety of factors considered by the Momentive Board
and the complexity of these factors, the Momentive Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify
or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and
recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Momentive Board applied his or her own personal
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
business judgment to the process and may have assigned different relative weights to the different factors.
The Momentive Board adopted and approved the merger agreement and the merger, and recommended that
Momentive stockholders adopt the merger agreement, based upon the totality of the information presented
to, and considered by, the Momentive Board. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above
may contain forward-looking statements, which should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”",68,73

Momentive retained Qatalyst Partners to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential
transaction such as the merger and to evaluate whether the per share price of $9.46 to be received pursuant
to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive
common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. Momentive selected Qatalyst Partners to act as Momentive’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst
Partners’ extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which Momentive operates and experience
advising technology companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. Qatalyst Partners has
provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the
Momentive Board on March 12, 2023, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Momentive Board its valuation
analysis and stated that Qatalyst Partners was prepared to render a financial opinion to the Momentive
Board based on that analysis, if asked to do so. Upon request of the Momentive Board the following day,
during the trading and prior to the Momentive Board’s approval of the merger agreement, Qatalyst Partners
delivered its written opinion, dated March 13, 2023, to the Board of Directors, to the effect that, based on
conditions as of March 12, 2023 and the financial analysis presented to the Momentive Board on March 12,
2023, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters
set forth therein, the merger consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any
affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For more information on the
delivery of the opinion by Qatalyst Partners to the Momentive Board, please see the section of this proxy

The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated March 13, 2023, is attached hereto as
Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of
the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. The Momentive stockholders
should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the
Momentive Board and addresses only, based upon and subject to the various other assumptions,
qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein,, the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the per share price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
merger agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any
affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the merger. It does
not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Momentive common stock
should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address
the price at which Momentive common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst
Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, certain related
documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of
Momentive. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the March 2023 long-range plan and the March 2023
extrapolations prepared by Momentive management (which is referred to in this section of the proxy
statement, collectively, as the “Momentive Projections”), described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past
and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Momentive with senior management of
Momentive. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Momentive
common stock and compared the financial performance of Momentive and the prices and trading activity of
Momentive common stock with that of certain other selected publicly traded companies and their securities.
In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected
66TABLE OF CONTENTS
acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and
considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made
available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Momentive. With respect to the Momentive
Projections, Qatalyst Partners was advised by Momentive management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed
based on discussions with Momentive management and the Momentive Board, that the Momentive
Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of Momentive management of the future financial performance of Momentive and other matters
covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft merger agreement reviewed by
Qatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed merger agreement, and that the merger
will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without any
modification, waiver or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of
all the necessary approvals of the merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed
that could have an adverse effect on Momentive or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the
merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Momentive or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the
assessment of Momentive management as to the existing and future technology and products of Momentive
and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has been approved
by its opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to it as of, March 12, 2023. Events occurring after March 12,
2023 may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners
has not been asked and has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst
Partners’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Momentive to engage in the merger,
or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to
Momentive. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per
share price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement by the
holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst
Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to
any of the officers, directors or employees of Momentive or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons,
relative to such consideration.
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with
its opinion dated March 13, 2023. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a
whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For
purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized, among other things, the Momentive Projections,
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Certain Unaudited Prospective Information.”
Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables
are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by
Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data
set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a
range of potential per-share present values for Momentive common stock as of December 31, 2022 (which is
the end of Momentive’s most recent completed fiscal year and most recent balance sheet date) by:
•
adding:
○
the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows excluding the
impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, non-recurring expenses, 
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and other non-cash items (which are referred to as the “UFCF”) of Momentive, based on the
Momentive Projections for calendar year 2023 through calendar year 2031 (which implied
present value was calculated using a range of discount rates of 12.0 percent to 14.5 percent,
based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for Momentive);
○
the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Momentive, calculated by
multiplying Momentive’s estimated UFCF in calendar year 2032 of approximately $225
million (excluding the effect of Momentive’s estimated remaining research and development
tax credits for calendar year 2032 of approximately $12 million, as such tax attributes
were separately valued, as described in the second succeeding bullet point below), based on
the Momentive Projections, by a range of fully diluted enterprise value to next-12-
months’ estimated UFCF multiples of 10.0x to 15.0x (which were chosen based on Qatalyst
Partners’ professional judgment), and discounted to present value using the same range of
discount rates used in the first bullet above;
○
the cash and cash equivalents of Momentive as of December 31, 2022, as provided by
Momentive management;
○
the implied net present value of Momentive’s estimated federal tax savings due to its
remaining research and development tax credits for calendar year 2032 (as provided by
Momentive’s management), discounted to present value using the same range of discount
rates used in the first bullet above; and
•
subtracting:
○
the principal amount of Momentive’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022, as provided
by Momentive management; and
•
dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Momentive common stock
outstanding (calculated using the treasury stock method), which takes into account outstanding
stock options and restricted stock units as of March 10, 2023, all as provided by Momentive
management, with each of the above-referenced estimated future UFCFs, terminal value and federal
tax savings due to remaining research and development tax credits for calendar year 2032 having
also been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each
respective applicable period (which totaled approximately 37 percent in the case of the terminal
value) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future
equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Momentive management.
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Momentive common
stock of approximately $7.52 to $10.48 per share.
Selected Companies Analysis
Qatalyst Partners reviewed and compared selected financial information and public market multiples for
Momentive with publicly available financial information and public market multiples for selected companies.
The companies used in this comparison were those companies listed below, which were selected by
Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are publicly traded
companies in similar lines of business to Momentive, have a similar business model, have similar financial
performance or have other relevant or similar characteristics.
Based upon third-party research analyst consensus estimates as of March 10, 2023 (which are referred to
as the “Analyst Projections”) and using the closing prices as of March 10, 2023 for shares of the selected
companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the fully diluted enterprise value divided by
the estimated consensus revenue for calendar year 2023 (which are referred to as the “CY2023E revenue
multiples”), for each of the selected companies.
Based upon the Analyst Projections and using the closing prices as of March 10, 2023 for shares of the

Based on an analysis of the CY2023E revenue multiples for the selected companies and the application of
its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 2.0x to 3.5x.
Qatalyst Partners then applied this range to each of Momentive’s estimated revenue for calendar year 2023:
$489 million based on the Momentive Projections, and $495 million based on the Analyst Projections.
Based on the fully diluted shares of Momentive common stock outstanding as of March 10, 2023 (calculated
utilizing the same methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement captioned “-Discounted
Cash Flow Analysis”). This analysis implied a range of values for Momentive common stock of
approximately $6.32 to $10.96 per share based on the Momentive Projections and approximately $6.40 to
$11.10 per share based on the Analyst Projections.
Based on an analysis of the CY2023E LFCF multiples for each of the selected companies and the
application of its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 10.0x
to 15.0x.
Qatalyst Partners then applied this range to each of Momentive’s estimated levered free cash flow for
calendar year 2023: $78 million based on the Management Projections, and $88 million based on the
Analyst Projections. Based on the fully diluted shares of Momentive common stock outstanding as of March
10, 2023 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Discounted Cash Flow Analysis”).This analysis implied a range of values for Momentive common
stock of approximately $4.96 to $7.44 per share based on the Momentive Projections and approximately
$5.57 to $8.35 per share based on the Analyst Projections.
No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Momentive. In evaluating the
selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these
matters are beyond the control of Momentive, such as the impact of competition on Momentive’s business
and the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in Momentive’s
financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or
mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself
a meaningful method of using selected company data.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Qatalyst Partners compared seven selected public company transactions announced since 2011 that had a
deal value of more than $1 billion, including transactions involving companies participating in similar lines of
business to Momentive or with similar business models, similar financial performance or other relevant or
similar characteristics.
For each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (1) the
implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of last-12-months’ revenue of the
69
TABLE OF CONTENTS
target company (which are referred to as the “LTM revenue multiples”), (2) the implied fully diluted enterprise
value of the target company as a multiple of the Analyst Projections of the next-12-months’ revenue of the
target company (which are referred to as the “NTM revenue multiples”) and (3) the implied fully diluted equity
value of the target company as a multiple of the Analyst Projections of the next-12-months levered free cash
flow of the target company (which are referred to as the “NTM LFCF multiples”).

Based on an analysis of the LTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional
judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 2.6x to 6.3x and then applied this
range to Momentive’s last-12 months’ revenue (calculated as the 12-month period ending December 31,
2022). Based on the fully diluted shares of Momentive common stock outstanding as of March 10, 2023
calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis”), as provided by Momentive management, this analysis implied a range of
values for Momentive common stock of approximately $8.04 to $19.08 per share.
Based on an analysis of the NTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional
judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 2.3x to 5.9x and then applied this
range to Momentive’s estimated next-12-months’ revenue (calculated as the 12-month period ending
December 31, 2023) based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count as
used in the immediately preceding paragraph, this analysis implied a range of values for Momentive common
stock of approximately $7.34 to $18.44 per share.
Based on an analysis of the NTM LFCF multiples for the selected transactions and its professional
judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 13.1x to 27.5x then applied this
range to Momentive’s estimated next-12-months’ levered free cash flow (calculated as the 12-month period
ending December 31, 2023) based on the Analyst Projections. Based on the same fully diluted share count
calculation as used for the analysis utilizing LTM revenue multiples above, this analysis implied a range of
values for Momentive common stock of approximately $7.30 to $15.23 per share.
No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Momentive or the
merger. In evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond Momentive’s control, such as the impact of competition on Momentive’s
business or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in
Momentive’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which
could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which
they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic
mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected transactional data.
Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the merger, Qatalyst Partners
cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.
Miscellaneous
In connection with the review of the merger by the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety
of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial
70
TABLE OF CONTENTS
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all its analyses as a whole and did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that
selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may
have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have
deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Qatalyst
Partners’ view of the actual value of Momentive. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Momentive. Any estimates
contained in Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the per share price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the merger agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or
any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price
at which Momentive common stock might actually trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Momentive Board was one of many factors considered
by the Momentive Board in deciding to approve the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as
described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Momentive Board with respect
to the per share price to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger
agreement by the holders of shares of Momentive common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of
Parent) or of whether the Momentive Board would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. The
per share price payable in the merger was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Momentive
and Parent and was approved by the Momentive Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Momentive
during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to
Momentive or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of
these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade
or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Momentive, Parent or certain of their
respective affiliates. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed
between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company, Parent, Symphony Technology Group or
the other equity co-investors of Parent, or their respective affiliates, pursuant to which compensation was
received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except that Qatalyst Partners acted as a financial advisor to
the Company in connection with certain shareholder activism and governance matters. Qatalyst Partners
and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to Momentive or
Parent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would expect to receive compensation.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided Momentive with financial
advisory services in connection with the merger for which it will be paid an aggregate amount
currently estimated at approximately $19 million, $3 million of which was payable upon delivery
of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), $2 million of which was
payable for services previously rendered and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon,
and subject to, the closing of the merger. Momentive has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst
Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. Momentive has also agreed to
indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers,
partners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its
affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, and
certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.

Other than in connection with Momentive’s regular earnings press releases and related investor materials,
Momentive does not, as a matter of course, make public its long term future financial projections, due to,
71TABLE OF CONTENTS
among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, Momentive management regularly prepares, and the Momentive Board regularly
evaluates prospective financial information as to Momentive’s future performance as part of its resource
planning and long-term business planning processes. Momentive management regularly makes and reviews
with the Momentive Board updates to its business plan, including to reflect actual results and trends and
changes in Momentive’s performance and the industry in which it operates.
During the period in which it was engaged in discussions with STG and certain other parties with respect to
a potential transaction, and as part of Momentive’s strategic planning process and evaluation of strategic
alternatives (including continuing as an independent company), Momentive management prepared and
reviewed with the Strategic Committee and the Momentive Board various unaudited forward-looking financial
information, including the unaudited prospective financial information summarized below. The tables below
summarize the (1) unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 included in
the long-term business plan for Momentive reviewed with, and approved by, the Momentive Board on April 8,
2022 (which financial information is referred to as the “April 2022 long-range plan”); (2) unaudited
prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 included in the long-term business plan
for Momentive reviewed with, and approved by, the Momentive Board on November 9, 2022 (which financial
information is referred to as the “November 2022 long-range plan”); and (3) unaudited prospective
financial information for fiscal years 2023 through 2026 included in the long-term business plan for
Momentive as updated by Momentive management as of, and reviewed with and approved by the Momentive
Board on, March 10, 2023 (which financial information is referred to as the “March 2023 long-range plan”),
together with extrapolations of such unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2027 through
2032 prepared by Momentive management and reviewed with the Momentive Board on March 10, 2023
(which extrapolations are referred to as the “March 2023 extrapolations”). For purposes of this proxy
statement, we refer to the April 2022, November 2022 long-range plan, the March 2023 long-range plan and
the March 2023 extrapolations, collectively, as the “unaudited prospective financial information.”
The unaudited prospective financial information was prepared for internal use and not for public disclosure
and was provided by Momentive management to the Strategic Committee and the Momentive Board for the
purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the merger and other strategic alternatives available to
Momentive. At the direction of the Momentive Board, the March 2023 long-range plan and the March 2023
extrapolations were also provided to, and approved by the Momentive Board for use by, Qatalyst Partners for
purposes of performing its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the Momentive
Board. Qatalyst Partners was advised by Momentive management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based
on discussions with Momentive management and the Momentive Board, that the March 2023 long-range
plan and the March 2023 extrapolations had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of Momentive management of the future financial performance of
Momentive and other matters covered thereby. In addition, as described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Background of the Merger,” at the direction of the Strategic Committee and the
Momentive Board, (1) a summary of the April 2022 long-range plan was provided to Financial Sponsor A on
April 18, 2022, (2) a summary of November 2022 long-range plan was provided to STG on November 18,
2022 and to certain other potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction involving Momentive in
October and November 2022, and (3) a summary of the March 2023 long-range plan was provided to STG on
March 10, 2023, in each case as part of Momentive’s discussions with those parties with respect to a
potential transaction and to assist in their respective due diligence review. For more information on the
preparation and use of the unaudited prospective financial information, please see the sections of this proxy
statement captioned “Background of the Merger” and “Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.”
The unaudited prospective financial information was developed by Momentive management as then-current
estimates of Momentive’s future financial performance as an independent company. The unaudited
prospective financial information does not give effect to the merger, including any impact of the negotiation or
execution of the merger agreement or the merger, the expenses that have already and will be incurred in
connection with completing the merger, or any changes to Momentive’s operations or strategy that may be
implemented in connection with the pendency of, or following the consummation of, the merger. The
unaudited prospective financial information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to
be completed; it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The unaudited prospective financial information constitutes forward-looking statements. The unaudited
prospective financial information is not included in this proxy statement to influence any decision on whether
to vote for the merger proposal or any other proposal presented at the special meeting, but rather is included
in this proxy statement to give stockholders access to certain non-public information that was provided to
the Strategic Committee, the Momentive Board and Qatalyst Partners for the purposes described above, as
well as to STG and certain other potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction involving
Momentive. By including the unaudited prospective financial information in this proxy statement, none of
Momentive, the Strategic Committee, the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners or any person has made or
makes any representation to any person regarding Momentive’s ultimate performance as compared to the
information contained in the unaudited prospective financial information. The inclusion of the unaudited
prospective financial information should not be regarded as an indication that Momentive, the Strategic
Committee, the Momentive Board or Qatalyst Partners or any other person considered, or now considers,
them to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, and such information should not be relied on as
such. Further, the inclusion of the unaudited prospective financial information in this proxy statement does
not constitute an admission or representation by Momentive that the information presented is material.
There can be no assurance that the prospective results will be realized or that actual results of Momentive
will not be materially lower or higher than estimated. The unaudited prospective financial information has not
been updated or revised to reflect information or results either as of or after the date of this proxy statement.
Momentive has, and may continue to, report results of operations for periods included in the unaudited
prospective financial information that were or will be completed following the preparation of the unaudited
prospective financial information. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to Momentive’s periodic
filings with the SEC for information on Momentive’s actual historical results.
The unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or
complying with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In addition, the
unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published
guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The unaudited prospective
financial information included in this proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,
Momentive’s management. Momentive’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,
has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the
unaudited prospective financial information and, accordingly, they do not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young LLP report incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement relates solely to Momentive’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to
the unaudited prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.
Although the unaudited prospective financial information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects
numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by Momentive management that Momentive
management believed in good faith were reasonable at the time the unaudited prospective financial
information was prepared, including with respect to (1) market, industry, customer and competitive trends in
Momentive’s business and industry; (2) growth rates for Momentive’s revenues in self-serve and sales-
assisted channels; (3) personnel, research and development and other operating expenses; (4) operating
margins; and (5) other relevant operating and financial measures. Momentive’s ability to achieve the financial
results contemplated by the unaudited prospective financial information will be affected by Momentive’s
ability to achieve its strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods, and will be subject to
operational and execution risks associated therewith. The unaudited prospective financial information
reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important factors that
may affect actual results and cause the unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved can
be found in the risk factors included in Momentive’s periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are
difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of Momentive’s control. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the unaudited prospective financial information will be realized, and Momentive’s actual
results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the unaudited prospective financial
information. For information on factors that may cause Momentive’s future results to materially vary, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.” The unaudited prospective
financial information may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts. You should evaluate the
unaudited prospective financial information, if at all, in conjunction with Momentive’s historical financial
statements and other

TABLE OF CONTENTS
information regarding Momentive contained in Momentive’s public filings with the SEC. The unaudited
prospective financial information may not be consistent with Momentive’s historical operating data as a
result of the assumptions utilized in preparing such information. Except to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws, Momentive do not intend to update or otherwise revise the unaudited prospective
financial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such information was prepared or to
reflect the occurrence of future events.
Because the unaudited prospective financial information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible
to sensitivities and assumptions, as well as to multiple interpretations based on actual experience and
business developments. The unaudited prospective financial information also covers multiple years, and
such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The unaudited
prospective financial information is not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating
results. Further, the unaudited prospective financial information is not fact and should not be relied upon as
being necessarily indicative of Momentive’s future results or for purposes of making any investment decision.
Certain of the financial measures included in the unaudited prospective financial information are non-GAAP
financial measures (which we refer to as the “non-GAAP financial measures”). These are financial
performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial
measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from
similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations
inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be
included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered
together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Financial
measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a
business combination transaction, such as the unaudited prospective financial information, are excluded
from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures” under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a
result, the unaudited prospective financial information is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of
non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial
measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided
to or relied upon by the Strategic Committee, the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners, or any other person.
Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the unaudited prospective financial
information is provided in this proxy statement.

Unlevered Free Cash Flow is calculated as non-GAAP operating income (loss), subtracting the impact of cash taxes, and
adding or subtracting (as applicable) the net impact of depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, changes in net
working capital and amortization of deferred costs. Unlevered Free Cash Flow excludes the impact of stock-based

the amount of $78 million, which estimate was prepared by Momentive management and used by Qatalyst Partners in
connection with its financial analyses for the purpose of rendering its opinion to the Momentive Board. Levered Free Cash

When considering the recommendation of the Momentive Board that you vote to approve the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that Momentive’s directors and executive officers may
have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Momentive’s
stockholders. Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Momentive’s directors,
in their capacities as Momentive stockholders, entered into the voting agreements with Parent and
Momentive. The voting agreements obligate these persons to vote their respective shares of Momentive
common stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and any action in furtherance of the
adoption of the merger agreement; (2) against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected
to result in a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Momentive in the
merger agreement; and (3) against any proposal involving Momentive or any of its subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to have a Momentive material adverse effect (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Representations and Warranties”) or materially impede,
interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the consummation of the merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger
agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that the merger
agreement be adopted by Momentive’s stockholders, the Momentive Board was aware of and considered
these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests are more
fully described below.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of Momentive will be entitled to certain
ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage, including under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policies. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-
Indemnification and Insurance.”
Treatment of Equity Awards
Treatment of Momentive RSUs
As of April 5, 2023, there were outstanding awards of Momentive RSUs (or portions thereof) that cover an
aggregate of 10,159,110 shares of Momentive common stock, of which Momentive RSUs covering an
aggregate of 66,182 shares of Momentive common stock were held by Momentive’s current non-employee
directors and of which Momentive RSUs covering an aggregate of 1,560,069 shares of Momentive common
stock were held by Momentive’s current executive officers.
75TABLE OF CONTENTS
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Momentive RSU will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive
common stock subject to such vested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable
withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Momentive RSU will be cancelled and converted into the
contingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive
common stock subject to such unvested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less
applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted
cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as applied
to the corresponding unvested Momentive RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, with
payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.
For more information regarding the treatment of Momentive RSUs held by Momentive’s directors and
executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Interests of Momentive’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.”
Treatment of Momentive Restricted Stock
As of April 5, 2023, there were 809,314 of shares of Momentive common stock subject to outstanding
Momentive restricted stock awards, none of which were held by Momentive’s current non-employee directors
and all of which were held by Momentive’s current executive officers (at maximum target performance for any
performance-based Momentive restricted stock award).
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Momentive restricted stock will be cancelled
and converted into the contingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of
shares of Momentive common stock subject to such outstanding Momentive restricted stock award,
multiplied by (2) the per share price, less withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger
agreement, each such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting
terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Momentive restricted stock award immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.
On March 13, 2022, we granted Alexander J. Lurie, our chief executive officer, a performance-based
restricted stock award (which we refer to as the “Lurie restricted stock award”). Pursuant to the terms of
the Restricted Stock Award Agreement governing the Lurie restricted stock award (which we refer to as the
“Restricted Stock Agreement”), the performance period applicable to the Lurie restricted stock award will
end five business days prior to closing and the compensation committee will determine the number of
shares eligible to vest (which we refer to as the “Lurie eligible shares”) based on Momentive’s total
stockholder return and the total stockholder return of an index as described in the Restricted Stock
Agreement. The per share price will be used to calculate Momentive’s total stockholder return. The number
of Lurie eligible shares will be calculated based on actual performance in accordance with the terms of the
Restricted Stock Agreement and, per the Restricted Stock Agreement, will be reduced by 19,189 shares
(the number of Lurie eligible shares that vested at the end of the one-year performance period as described
in the Restricted Stock Agreement). Upon closing, a pro-rated number of the Lurie eligible shares will vest
with such pro-ration calculated by multiplying the number of Lurie eligible shares by a fraction with a
numerator equal to the number of completed calendar months that have elapsed between the March 13,
2022 grant date of the Lurie restricted stock award and the closing, and a denominator of 36. Following
closing, the remaining Lurie eligible shares will vest in approximately equal installments on each quarterly
anniversary of the closing through March 13, 2025, with any remaining unvested Lurie eligible shares vesting
on March 13, 2025. Vesting of the Lurie eligible shares is subject to continued service, but the Lurie eligible
shares will be eligible for accelerated vesting upon a qualifying termination of employment under Mr. Lurie’s
change in control and severance agreement. At 100% of target, 180,704 shares of Momentive common
stock would become Lurie eligible shares. At maximum performance, 200% of target, or 361,408 shares of
Momentive common stock would become Lurie eligible shares. For purposes of this disclosure, we have
assumed that performance will be achieved at 100% of target and 161,515 shares of Momentive common
stock (the 180,704 shares achieved at 100% of target reduced by the 19,189 shares that vested at the end
of the one-year performance period as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement) will become Lurie
eligible shares. At maximum performance, 342,219 shares of Momentive common stock (361,408 shares
reduced by the 19,189 shares
76
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that vested at the end of the one-year performance period as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement)
would become Lurie eligible shares. For more information regarding the treatment of Momentive restricted
stock held by Momentive’s directors and executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Interests of Momentive’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger- Change in Control and
Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.”
Treatment of Momentive Options
As of April 5, 2023, 10,778,822 shares were subject to outstanding Momentive options, of which 880,000
have an exercise price below the per share price. Momentive options to purchase an aggregate of 896,431
shares of Momentive common stock were held by Momentive’s current non-employee directors, none of
which have an exercise price below the per share price, and Momentive options to purchase an aggregate of
6,672,237 shares of Momentive common stock were held by Momentive’s current executive officers, of
which 600,000 have an exercise price below the per share price.
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive
common stock subject to the vested Momentive option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share
price over the exercise price per share of Momentive common stock under such vested Momentive option,
less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the
contingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive
common stock subject to such unvested Momentive option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per
share price over the exercise price per share of Momentive common stock under such unvested Momentive
option, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such
converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding unvested Momentive option immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.
Any underwater Momentive option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration or
payment.
For more information regarding the treatment of Momentive options held by Momentive’s directors and
executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Interests of Momentive’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.”
Treatment of the ESPP in connection with the Merger
We have taken, or will take prior to the effective time of the merger, all action that we determine to be
reasonably necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the merger, (1) cause any offering period or
purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be outstanding at the effective time of the merger to
be terminated no later than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger; (2) make any
adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period,
but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed
offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (3) cause the exercise (as of no
later than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger) of each outstanding purchase right
pursuant to the ESPP; and (4) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence
pursuant to the ESPP upon or after the effective time of the merger. The ESPP will terminate as of the
effective time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger). Of Momentive’s current
executive officers, five are enrolled in the ESPP for the current purchase period. Momentive’s non-employee
directors are not eligible to participate in the ESPP.

amended, that are outstanding and held by Momentive’s non-employee directors, including pursuant to
Momentive’s Outside Director Compensation Policy. Pursuant to the 2018 plan and the Outside Director
Compensation Policy, equity awards granted to Momentive’s non-employee directors will accelerate vesting
upon a “change in control.” The closing of the merger will be a “change in control” within the meaning of
Momentive’s 2018 plan and the terms of the Outside Director Compensation Policy.
Change in Control and Severance Agreements
Momentive has entered into a change in control and severance agreement with each of its current executive
officers that provide for the severance and change in control benefits as described below. Messrs.
Coulombe’s, Schoenstein’s and Hale’s change in control and severance agreement terminated upon their
resignation of their position and such individuals are not entitled to receive any benefits pursuant to the
agreement.
Each change in control and severance agreement with Momentive’s current executive officers (with the
exception of Mr. Sullivan, whose change in control and severance agreement does not have a term) has an
initial term of three years commencing on the effective date of the agreement. On the third anniversary of the
effective date of the agreement, the agreement will renew automatically for additional one-year terms unless
either party provides the other party with written notice of nonrenewal at least one-year prior to the date of
automatic renewal. However, if a change in control (as defined in the applicable agreement) occurs when
there are fewer than 12 months remaining during the initial term or during an additional term, the term of the
change in control and severance agreement will extend automatically through the date that is 12 months
following the date of the change in control. Additionally, if an initial occurrence of an act or omission by
Momentive that constitutes grounds for “good reason” occurs, and the expiration date of any cure period with
respect to such grounds could occur following the expiration of the initial term or an additional term, the term
of the change in control and severance agreement will extend automatically for 15 days following the
expiration of the cure period.
Termination Without Change in Control
If an executive’s employment is terminated outside the period beginning 90 days before a change in control
and ending 12 months following a change in control, which we refer to the “change in control period,” either
(1) by Momentive (or any Momentive subsidiaries) without “cause” (excluding by reason of death or
disability) or (2) by
79
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any executive for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in each of their change in control and severance
agreement), they will receive the following benefits if they timely sign and do not revoke a release of claims
in Momentive’s favor (which may include an agreement not to disparage Momentive or any of its
subsidiaries, non-solicit provisions and an agreement to assist in any litigation matters) and provided they
return all documents and other property provided by Momentive and resign from all officer and director
positions:
•
A lump-sum payment equal to 12 months for Mr. Lurie or six months for Mses. Blum, Cantieri and
Carr and Messrs. Ewell and Sullivan of annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to such
termination (or if such termination is due to a resignation for good reason based on a material
reduction in base salary, then as in effect immediately prior to the reduction) and for Mr. Sullivan, a
lump-sum payment equal to a prorated portion of his target annual bonus as in effect for the fiscal
year in which the termination occurs, prorated based on the number of days of completed service
for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs (or, if such termination occurs within the first six
months’ of his employment, the proration will be increased to reflect six months of employment);
and
•
payment of premiums for coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended, which we refer to as “COBRA,” for up to 18 months for Mr. Lurie and up to six
months for Mses. Blum, Cantieri, and Carr and Messrs. Ewell and Sullivan (and for each of their
eligible dependents, if any), or taxable monthly payments for the equivalent period in the event
payment of the COBRA premiums would violate or be subject to an excise tax under, applicable
law.
Termination With Change in Control
If, within the change in control period, an executive officer’s employment is terminated either (1) by
Momentive (or any Momentive subsidiary) without cause (excluding by reason of death or disability) or (2) by
any executive for good reason, they will receive the following benefits if they timely sign and do not revoke a
release of claims in Momentive’s favor (which may include an agreement not to disparage Momentive or any
of its subsidiaries, non-solicit provisions and an agreement to assist in any litigation matters) and provided
they return all documents and other property provided by Momentive and resign from all officer and director
positions:
•
a lump-sum payment, less applicable withholdings, equal to the sum of (x) 18 months for Mr. Lurie,
and 12 months for Mses. Blum, Cantieri and Carr and Messrs. Ewell and Sullivan, of annual base
salary as in effect immediately prior to such termination (or if such termination is due to a
resignation for good reason based on a material reduction in base salary, then as in effect
immediately prior to the reduction or if greater, at the level in effect immediately prior to the change
in control) and (y) a prorated portion of such executive’s target annual bonus as in effect for the
fiscal year in which the termination occurs, prorated based on the number of days of completed
service for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs;
•
payment of premiums for coverage under COBRA for the executive and such executive’s eligible
dependents, if any, for up to 18 months for Mr. Lurie, up to 12 months for Mr. Sullivan and up to six
months for Mses. Blum, Cantieri and Carr and Mr. Ewell, or taxable monthly payments for the
equivalent period in the event payment of the COBRA premiums would violate, or be subject to an
excise tax under, applicable law; and
•
other than for Mr. Sullivan, 100% accelerated vesting and exercisability of all outstanding equity
awards and, in the case of an equity award with performance-based vesting unless otherwise
specified in the applicable equity award agreement governing such award, all performance goals
and other vesting criteria generally will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and for Mr.
Sullivan, pursuant to the terms of his change in control and severance agreement, because the
merger agreement was signed within six months of his employment start date, accelerated vesting
and exercisability as to 25% of the then-unvested shares subject to each of his then-outstanding
equity awards and, in the case of an equity award with performance-based vesting unless
otherwise specified in the applicable equity award agreement governing such award, all
performance goals and other vesting criteria generally will be deemed achieved at 100% of target
levels.
If any of the amounts provided for under these change in control and severance agreements or otherwise
payable to any Momentive executives would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code and could be subject to the related excise tax, the executive would be entitled to
80
TABLE OF CONTENTS
receive either full payment of such benefits or such lesser amount which would result in no portion of the
benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greater amount of after-tax benefits to the
executive. The change in control and severance agreements do not require Momentive to provide any tax
gross-up payments.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Momentive Named Executive Officers
The following information, table and the related footnotes present information about the compensation
payable to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding certain
compensation for each of Momentive’s named executive officers that is based on, or that otherwise relates
to, the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC
disclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable
to Momentive’s named executive officers. Momentive’s “named executive officers” for purposes of the
disclosure in this proxy statement are Alexander J. Lurie, Richard Sullivan Jr., Lora Blum, Clarence Ewell,
Priyanka Carr, Justin Coulombe, and John Schoenstein. For additional details regarding the terms of the
payments quantified below, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Momentive’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity Awards” and “-Interests of Momentive’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Agreements.”
The amounts in the table are estimated using the following assumptions and such additional assumptions
as may be set forth in the footnotes to the table:
•
that the effective time of the merger will occur on April 5, 2023 (which is the assumed closing date
of the merger solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure);
•
that the current named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination of his or her
employment at the effective time of the merger that resulted in severance benefits becoming
payable to such named executive officer under his or her change in control and severance
agreement; and
•
that the Lurie restricted stock award is achieved at 100% of target and all Lurie eligible shares will
vest.
The amounts reported below are estimates based on these and other assumptions that may or may not
actually occur or be accurate on the date the merger actually closes. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be
received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth
below. Momentive’s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation,
or tax reimbursements in connection with the merger. As required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts
below that are determined using the per share value of Momentive common stock have been calculated
based on the per share price.

Reflects the amount of “double-trigger” payments to which the named executive officer may become entitled under their
change in control and severance agreement. The amount becomes payable if a named executive officer’s employment is
terminated during the period beginning 90 days before a change in control (including the merger) and ending 12 months
following a change in control, either (1) by Momentive (or any Momentive subsidiaries) without “cause” (excluding by
reason of death or disability) or

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(2) by any named executive officer for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in each of their change in control and
severance agreement), subject to the named executive officer timely signing and revoking a release of claims in
Momentive’s favor and provided the named executive officer returns all documents and other property provided by
Momentive and resigns from all officer and director positions. We refer to such termination as a “qualifying termination”.
The amounts represent a lump-sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of (x) 18 months for Mr. Lurie and 12 months
for Messrs. Sullivan and Ewell and Mses. Blum and Carr, and (y) a prorated portion of such named executive officer’s
target annual bonus as in effect for fiscal year 2023, prorated for the number of days during the fiscal year that elapsed
during fiscal year 2023 prior to (and including) April 5, 2023, as follows:

Equity. The numbers in the table represent the value of accelerated vesting of outstanding unvested in-the-money
Momentive options, Momentive RSUs and Momentive restricted stock awards, as applicable (based on the assumptions
described below). As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Momentive’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity Awards,” outstanding unvested equity awards will be cancelled and
converted into the contingent right to receive a cash payment subject to vesting.
The values in the equity column of the tables above and below reflect the accelerated vesting terms upon closing and of the
named executive officer’s change in control and severance agreement and the following assumptions:
•
the closing date of the merger occurs on April 5, 2023 and the Lurie restricted stock award is achieved at 100% of
target;
•
as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Momentive’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity Awards,” a portion of the Lurie eligible shares will vest at close and
payment is not conditioned upon Mr. Lurie’s qualifying termination, which is a “single-trigger” benefit; and
•
the named executive officer’s employment is terminated in connection with a qualifying termination (after the time such
outstanding equity awards are cancelled and converted by Parent), such that the named executive officer’s
outstanding and unvested Momentive equity awards will vest in full (or, in the case of Mr. Sullivan, will vest as to 25%
of the then-unvested shares subject to his awards), which is a “double-trigger” benefit.

With respect to Momentive options, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, less the option’s
exercise price, multiplied by (ii) the number of outstanding unvested in-the-money Momentive options held by the named
executive officer (or, in the case of Mr. Sullivan, with respect to 25% of the outstanding Momentive RSUs held by Mr.
Sullivan).
With respect to Momentive RSUs, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii) the
number of outstanding Momentive RSUs held by the named executive officer.
With respect to Momentive restricted stock (other than the Lurie restricted stock award), the amount is determined as the
product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii) the number of outstanding shares of Momentive restricted stock held by
the named executive officer.
With respect to the Lurie restricted stock award, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price,
multiplied by (ii) the number of Lurie eligible shares assuming performance is achieved at 100% of target. Based on such
assumption, 161,515 shares of Momentive common stock (the 180,704 shares achieved at 100% of target reduced by the
19,189 shares that vested at the end of the one-year performance period as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement)
will become Lurie eligible shares. At maximum performance, 342,219 shares of Momentive common stock (the 361,408
shares received at maximum performance reduced by the 19,189 shares that vested at the end of the one-year
performance period as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement) would become Lurie eligible shares. As described in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Momentive’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-
Treatment of Equity Awards,” a portion of the Lurie eligible shares will vest at close. If closing occurs on April 5, 2023, and
assuming 100% of target performance, 53,838 of the Lurie eligible shares (with a value of approximately $509,308) will
vest at close and vesting and payment is not conditioned upon Mr. Lurie’s qualifying termination (a “single-trigger” benefit).
The remaining 107,677 Lurie eligible shares (with a value of approximately $1,018,624) will vest upon a qualifying
termination (a “double-trigger benefit”).

Perquisites / Benefits. For each of the named executive officers, the amount shown represents the cost of payment of
premiums for coverage under COBRA for the named executive officer and such named executive officer’s eligible
dependents, if any, for up to 18 months for Mr. Lurie, up to 12 months for Mr. Sullivan and up to six months for Mses. Blum
and Carr and Mr. Ewell, which becomes payable upon a qualifying termination, and accordingly these amounts are “double-

the amounts provided for under the individual’s change in control and severance agreement or otherwise payable to any of
the named executive officers would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
could be subject to the related excise tax, the named executive officer would be entitled to receive either full payment of his
or her benefits or such lesser amount which would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to the excise tax,
whichever results in the greater amount of after-tax benefits to the named executive officer. Totals may not foot due to

other retention with the surviving corporation or with Parent or any subsidiary to be effective following the
consummation of the merger. However, prior to the effective time of the merger, Parent or any subsidiary

The closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is agreed upon by Momentive, Parent, and
Merger Sub, but no later than three business days after the last condition to closing is satisfied or waived
(excluding conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the

If the merger is consummated, Momentive’s stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of
Momentive’s capital stock) who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) properly
demand an appraisal of their shares; (3) continuously hold of record or beneficially own their shares through
the effective time of the merger; (4) otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL; and
(5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal may, subject to the conditions
thereof, seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, which
we refer to as “Section 262.” Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in
this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares as to which appraisal rights are asserted,
all references in Section 262 and in this summary “beneficial owner” mean a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and all
references in Section 262 and in this summary to the word “person” mean any individual, corporation,

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the
DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is available at the following URL,
accessible without subscription or cost, which is incorporated herein by reference:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary does not constitute
any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Momentive’s stockholders exercise
their appraisal rights under Section 262. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FULL
TEXT OF SECTION 262 AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED BELOW. 
83TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of Momentive common stock or
beneficial owners who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of Momentive
common stock to Momentive prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote, in
person or by proxy, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (3) continuously hold of record or
beneficially own such shares on the date of making the demand for appraisal through the effective time of
the merger; and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth
in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of Momentive common stock appraised by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash, in lieu of the consideration set forth in the merger
agreement, for the “fair value” of their shares of Momentive common stock, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger through the date
of payment of the judgment (or in certain circumstances described herein, on the difference between the
amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the merger to
each person entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) as described
further below. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a
hearing to determine persons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders
of shares of a class or series of stock that, immediately prior to the closing of the merger, were listed on a
national securities exchange who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (A) the total number of
shares of the class or series of stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued or perfected exceeds one
percent of the outstanding shares of such class or series as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of
Section 262; or (B) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We
refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Given that the shares of Momentive common
stock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until closing of the merger),
then the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of Momentive
common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is
satisfied.
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest on the amount determined to be the fair value of the shares subject to appraisal will accrue and
compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five
percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving
corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person entitled to appraisal, interest will accrue
thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of
the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment
prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,
the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as
of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a
copy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at
which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes
Momentive’s notice to Momentive’s stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the
m e r g e r ,  a n d  t h e  f u l l  t e x t  o f  S e c t i o n  2 6 2  i s  a v a i l a b l e  a t  t h e  f o l l o w i n g  U R L :
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the merger, any holder of
shares of Momentive common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve
such holder’s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the
requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under
the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price
described in the merger agreement less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the
procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Momentive common stock, Momentive
believes that if a person is considering exercising such rights, such person should seek the advice of legal
counsel.
Stockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of
Momentive common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
such person must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
84
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
such person must deliver to Momentive a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the
merger agreement at the special meeting;
•
such person must continuously hold of record or beneficially own the shares of Momentive
common stock from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a
person will lose appraisal rights if the person transfers the shares before the effective time of the
merger); and
•
such person or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after
the effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition
and has no intention of doing so).
In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to
determine persons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who
asserted appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock unless one of the
ownership thresholds is met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, each person who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain.
Filing Written Demand
A person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Momentive, before the vote on the adoption of
the merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person’s shares. In
addition, that person must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A
vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether
by mail or via the internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the
shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A person exercising
appraisal rights must hold or own, as applicable, beneficially or of record, the shares on the date the written
demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold or own, as applicable, the shares through the
effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless
revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the
stockholder’s and beneficial owner’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written
demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or
abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the
merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of
Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on
the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not
constitute a demand. A person’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the
adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a stockholder of record, the demand must reasonably
inform Momentive of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an
appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a beneficial
owner, the demand must reasonably identify the record holder of the shares for which the demand is made,
be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of such stock
and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and
provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the surviving
corporation and to be set forth on the verified list (as defined below).
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person’s demand for
appraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, less any applicable
withholding taxes, by delivering to Momentive, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the
demand for appraisal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of
Chancery will be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and
such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just,
including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction (which we refer to as a “reservation”) for any
application (as defined below); provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any person who has
not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time
of the merger. If the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding
with respect to a person, such person will be entitled to receive only the fair value determined in any such
appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered
pursuant to the merger agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will
notify each stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of each constituent corporation who has properly
made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective time thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any
person who has complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy
served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by any person other than the surviving
corporation, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders
entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a
petition, and stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any
negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Momentive common stock. Accordingly, any
persons who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Momentive common stock within the time and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could
nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements
for an appraisal of such person’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to
receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Momentive has received demands
for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares
(provided that where a beneficial owner makes a demand for appraisal directly, the record holder of such
shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of this aggregate
number). Such statement must be given within ten days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the
written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy
thereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such
service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the “verified
list”) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and
with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the
surviving corporation and all of the persons shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. The
costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.
86
TABLE OF CONTENTS
After notice is provided to the applicable persons as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, at the
hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with
Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery
may require the persons who demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by stock
certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any person fails to comply with this requirement, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. Upon application by the surviving
corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the verified list may participate fully in
all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262.
Given that the shares common stock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed
up until closing of the merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to
all holders of shares of Momentive common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one
of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal and, with respect to
Momentive common stock, that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect
of persons seeking appraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the
rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of
Momentive common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest from the effective time of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the merger and
the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the
Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to
each person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to
subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any,
between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of
the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest accrued before such voluntary
cash payment, unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods
which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving
the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,
the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on
future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does
not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value
arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also
stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible
of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they
would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an
investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a
87
TABLE OF CONTENTS
merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262.
ALTHOUGH MOMENTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE PER SHARE PRICE IS FAIR, NO REPRESENTATION IS
MADE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE APPRAISAL OF FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE
DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, AND STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT SUCH AN
APPRAISAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF A VALUE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN, OR THE
SAME AS, THE PER SHARE PRICE. Neither Momentive nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per
share price to any persons exercising appraisal rights, and each of Momentive and Parent reserves the
rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Momentive common
stock is less than the per share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or, with respect to
Momentive common stock, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of
persons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest,
if any, by the surviving corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such
person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court
of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such Delaware Court of Chancery may be
enforced.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of
experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware
Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name
appears on the verified list who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith
(which we refer to as an “application”), the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion
of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal that were not
dismissed pursuant to the terms of Section 262 or subject to an award pursuant to a reservation. In the
absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Momentive common stock under Section
262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of
Momentive common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the
right to receive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or
effectively lose, such person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of
those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock, or if the person
delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person’s demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the effective time of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance
with Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of Momentive common stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective time of the merger); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to
the shares of Momentive common stock, or if such person delivers to the surviving corporation a written
withdrawal of such person’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, within 60 days after
the effective time of the merger, then the right of such person to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person
without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court
deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect
the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger within 60 days after the effective time of the merger.
88
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of
appraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in
accordance with the merger agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person
wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise
those rights.

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that
may be relevant to U.S. holders and Non-U.S. holders of shares of Momentive common stock whose shares
are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”), U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(which we refer to as the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy
statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.
This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Momentive common stock as “capital assets”
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, as property held for investment purposes). With
respect to holders whose shares of Momentive common stock were subject to vesting restrictions at the
time such shares were acquired, if any, this discussion assumes that a valid and timely election pursuant to
Section 83(b) of the Code was made with respect to such shares.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences
that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does
not address:
•
tax consequences to holders who received their shares of Momentive common stock in a
compensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of Momentive options, or Momentive RSUs,
or otherwise in connection with the performance of services;
•
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under
U.S. federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S
corporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-
through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in
stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of
accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts;
entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; holders who hold their common stock as “qualified
small business stock” for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code, as “Section 1244
stock” within the meaning of Section 1244 of the Code, or through individual retirement or other tax-
deferred accounts; Non-U.S. holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of
Momentive common stock; or U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of
the United States;
•
tax consequences to holders holding shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,
straddle, or other risk reduction transaction;
•
tax consequences to U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or
other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
•
tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
•
tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of
gross income with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock being taken into account in
an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in the Code);
•
any U.S. federal estate, gift, or alternative or other minimum tax consequences;
89TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
any state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
•
tax consequences to persons that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand
appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common stock, then the tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Momentive common stock and
partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the merger described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given
that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court. Further, no opinion of counsel has
been or will be rendered with respect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-
INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.
U.S. Holders
General
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common
stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source;
or
•
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the
control of one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2)
has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United
States person.
Taxable Sale of Company Capital Stock
The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Momentive common stock pursuant to the
merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. holder’s
gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the shares surrendered in the merger generally will equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for
those shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such
U.S. holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the
merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate
U.S. holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder
acquired different blocks of shares of Momentive common stock at different times and/or different prices,
such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block
of Momentive common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders
General
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common
stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
90
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Taxable Sale of Company Capital Stock
Subject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below) withholding, any gain
realized by a Non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. holder in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case such gain
generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons,
and, if the Non-U.S. holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits
tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in
the taxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in
which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower
rate under an applicable income tax treaty) and such person will generally be required to file a U.S.
federal income tax return; or
•
Momentive is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is
defined in Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as a “USRPHC”), at any time within the
shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. holder’s holding period with
respect to the applicable shares of Momentive common stock (which we refer to as the “relevant
period”) and, if shares of Momentive common stock are regularly traded on an established
securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. holder
owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of Momentive common stock at
any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),
except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair
market value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50
percent of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other
assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests
generally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Although there can be no
assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time
during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their
tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds
received by a holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. holder
that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. holder is not subject to
backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or an appropriate substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S.
holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-U.S. holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of
IRS Form W-8 (or an appropriate substitute or successor form); or (b) otherwise appropriately establishes an
exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
A U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder’s common stock and file with its U.S.
federal income tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain
facts relating to the merger.
Additional Withholding Requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance
issued thereunder (which we refer to as, collectively, “FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30
percent on certain payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under these rules)
unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain
91
TABLE OF CONTENTS
payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain
U.S. account holders of such institution (which include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as
well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA
also generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-
financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a certification identifying certain
direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement
between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain
circumstances, a Non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.
The U.S. Treasury Department has released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form,
would eliminate the FATCA withholding applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of
Momentive common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department
stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Holders of Momentive common stock are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the
possible implications of FATCA on the disposition of Momentive common stock pursuant to the merger.
THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE INCLUDED
FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW.

General Efforts
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and Momentive, on the other hand, agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions; do, or cause to be done, all things; and assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, or causing to be done, all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to
applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the merger, in the most expeditious manner
practicable including by using reasonable best efforts to: (1) cause the conditions to the merger to be
satisfied; (2) seek to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, orders, and authorizations from governmental
authorities, and make all registrations, declarations, and filings with governmental authorities, in each case
that are necessary or advisable to consummate the merger; and (3) seek to obtain all consents, waivers and
approvals and deliver all notifications, in each case pursuant to any material contracts in connection with the
merger agreement and the consummation of the merger so as to seek to maintain and preserve the benefits
to the surviving corporation of such material contracts as of and following the consummation of the merger;
provided, however, that nothing in the merger agreement requires Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective
affiliates to commit to or effect any action with respect to the capital stock or other equity or voting interests,
assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products or businesses of affiliates of Parent or
Merger Sub (other than Parent and Merger Sub and, following the closing, the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries).
HSR Act; Foreign Direct Investment Laws
Under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period (and any extensions
thereof) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act have expired or otherwise been terminated, or all
requisite consents pursuant thereto have been obtained, and all approvals or clearances of the relevant
governmental authorities under the specified foreign direct investment laws have been obtained.
Momentive and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act
with the FTC and the DOJ on March 24, 2023. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired at
11:59 p.m., California time on April 24, 2023.
In addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with Momentive, submitted the specified foreign direct
investment filing in Italy on April 20, 2023 and may submit additional foreign direct investment filings under
certain circumstances.
 
92TABLE OF CONTENTS
Momentive and Parent have each agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to,
as soon as reasonably practicable, cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
pursuant to the HSR Act and to receive consent, approval, or clearance, or the expiration of any applicable
waiting periods under the specified foreign direct investment laws, and any other antitrust law or foreign
direct investment law applicable to the merger; provided, however, that nothing in the merger agreement
requires Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective affiliates to commit to or effect any action with respect to
the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,
properties, products or businesses of affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub (other than Parent and Merger Sub
and, following the closing, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries).
Additionally, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed (and will cause the Guarantors, the investment
consortium led by STG and its and their respective affiliates) not to acquire or agree to acquire by merging,
or consolidating with, by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by acquiring in any other
manner, any business of any person or other business organization or division if such business competes in
any line of business with Momentive or its subsidiaries and the entering into a definitive agreement relating
to the consummation of such transaction would reasonably be expected to (1) materially increase the risk of
not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration, or approval of any governmental authority by
the termination date necessary to consummate the merger or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period; (2) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the merger; (3) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on

At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and
notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action
under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Momentive or Parent. Private parties
may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the
extent necessary to obtain clearance consents, approvals, waivers, actions, waiting period expirations or
terminations, non-actions, or other authorizations pursuant to applicable antitrust laws and specified foreign
direct investment laws, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under antitrust laws or
specified foreign direct investment laws applicable to the merger, in each case, as promptly as practicable
so as to allow the consummation of the merger as promptly as practicable, and in any event at least three
business days prior to the termination date offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise (a) the sale, divestiture, license, or other disposition, of any and all of the
capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products, or
businesses of Parent, Momentive, or their respective subsidiaries; (b) the termination, modification, or
assignment of existing relationships, joint ventures, contracts, or obligations of Parent, Momentive, or their
respective subsidiaries; (c) the modification of any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent,
Momentive, or their respective subsidiaries; and (d) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent,
Momentive, or their respective subsidiaries; provided, however, that nothing in the merger agreement requires
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective affiliates to, and Momentive will not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, commit to or effect any action with respect to the capital stock or other equity or voting
interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products or businesses of affiliates of
Parent or Merger Sub (other than Parent and Merger Sub and, following the closing, the surviving corporation

One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement, or
limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek
to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions

significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to
predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will
ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by Momentive’s
stockholders and the completion of the merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure
you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, obtained at all, or
that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional
conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These
conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.",99,101

In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the investment consortium led
by STG delivered the equity commitment letter to Parent, pursuant to which the investment consortium led
by STG committed to provide Parent, at the effective time of the merger, with an equity investment of
approximately $1.17 billion to fund a portion of the aggregate merger consideration and to pay fees and
expenses related to the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the equity commitment letter.
Momentive is a third party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter and is entitled to enforce the
investment commitment, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. Additionally, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the debt financing sources
delivered a debt commitment letter to Parent dated March 13, 2023, pursuant to which the lenders party to
that letter committed to provide Parent, at the effective time of the merger, with debt financing of $450 million
to fund a portion of the aggregate merger consideration and to refinance Momentive’s existing credit
facilities, subject to the terms and conditions of the debt commitment letter. These financing amounts,
together with Momentive’s cash on hand at closing, will be sufficient to fund the aggregate merger
consideration payable to Momentive’s stockholders and the other payments required to be paid in
connection with the completion of the merger (in each case, pursuant to certain terms and conditions).
Limited Guaranty
Pursuant to the Limited Guaranty, the Guarantors have agreed to guarantee, among other things, due and
punctual performance and discharge of the guaranteed obligations. The aggregate obligations of the
Guarantors under the Limited Guaranty is limited to (a) the Parent termination fee of $104.0 million, plus (b)
enforcement expenses up to $7.0 million, plus (c) certain reimbursement obligations. The Limited Guaranty
guarantees, among other things, the payment of the termination fee payable by Parent under the terms,

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, on March 13, 2023, following approval thereof by
the Momentive Board, Parent and Momentive entered into voting agreements with the voting agreement
stockholders. The following summary describes certain material provisions of the voting agreements, a form
of which is attached hereto as Annex C and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The description
of the voting agreements in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the complete text of the voting agreements.
Voting
Each voting agreement stockholder agreed that during the voting period, such voting agreement stockholder
will vote or cause to be voted all shares of Momentive common stock that he, she, or it beneficially owns,
among other things:
•
in favor of: (i) the adoption of the merger agreement; and (ii) any action in furtherance of the
adoption of the merger agreement;
•
against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in a material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation of Momentive in the merger agreement; and
94TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
against any proposal involving Momentive or any of its subsidiaries that would reasonably be
expected to have a Momentive material adverse effect (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Representations and Warranties”) or materially
impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the consummation of the merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
However, if Momentive Board makes a Momentive Board recommendation change (as defined in the section
of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-The Momentive Board’s Recommendation; Board
Recommendation Change”) during the voting period, then the voting agreement stockholders will instead vote
their shares of Momentive common stock in the same proportion (for, against or abstain) as the votes that
are collectively cast by all of the other holders of Momentive common stock who are present and voting with
respect to each such matter.
As of the record date, the voting agreement stockholders subject to the voting agreements beneficially
owned in the aggregate approximately 12.47 percent of the outstanding shares of Momentive common
stock.
Restrictions on Inconsistent Arrangements and Transfers
The voting agreements contain customary provisions restricting the voting agreement stockholders from
entering into arrangements inconsistent with the terms of the voting agreements during the term of the voting
agreements. Each voting agreement stockholder has also agreed that, with limited exceptions, prior to the
termination of its voting agreement, it will not transfer any shares of Momentive common stock or other
Momentive securities beneficially owned or acquired by such voting agreement stockholder during the voting
period.
Termination
By its terms, each voting agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (1) the termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms; (2) the effective time of the merger; (3) the effectiveness of
any amendment, modification or supplement to the merger agreement that decreases the per share price
(other than any such decrease in accordance with certain applicable terms of the merger agreement),
changes the form of the per share price, or is otherwise materially adverse to the Momentive’s stockholders;
and (4) with respect to any voting agreement stockholder, the termination of the voting agreement by written
agreement of each of Parent, Momentive, and such voting agreement stockholder.",101,102

Case No. 3:23-cv-01936-TLT. On April 24, 2023, a purported Momentive stockholder filed a complaint in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and the members of the
Momentive Board, captioned Wang v. Momentive Global, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-03408. On April 26,
2023, a purported Momentive stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of California against the Company and the members of the Momentive Board, captioned DeVey v. Momentive
Global, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:23-cv-02032. We refer to the complaints referenced in this paragraph as the
“Complaints.”
The Complaints assert claims against all defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule
14a-9 promulgated thereunder for issuing Momentive’s preliminary proxy statement with allegedly false and
misleading statements of material facts and omissions of material facts and against the individual
defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged “control person” liability with respect to such

false and misleading statements of material facts and omissions of material facts. The allegations in the
Complaints include that the preliminary proxy statement omitted material information regarding Momentive’s
financial projections, the analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners, potential conflicts of interest involving
Qatalyst Partners, and potential conflicts of interest involving alleged Momentive insiders. The Complaints
seek, among other relief, (1) to enjoin defendants from consummating the merger; (2) to rescind the merger
agreement or recover damages, if the merger is completed; (3) an accounting of damages; and (4) attorneys’
fees and costs.
The defendants believe that the disclosures set forth in the preliminary proxy statement comply fully with all
applicable laws and that the allegations contained in the Complaints are without merit. Additional lawsuits
arising out of the merger may be filed in the future. No assurances can be made as to the outcome of such
lawsuits or the Complaints.

statement, including the information set forth in the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger”

RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION","PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL, ON A NON-BINDING, ADVISORY BASIS, OF CERTAIN
MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a
non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable by Momentive to
Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Momentive’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the additional disclosures referenced therein that
otherwise are disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of
Momentive’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
We are asking Momentive’s stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by
Momentive to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger. These payments are set
forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Momentive’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes and
additional disclosures referenced therein. The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these
compensation payments may be made generally have previously formed part of Momentive’s overall
compensation program for Momentive’s named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to
stockholders in public filings, including Momentive’s annual proxy statement. These historical arrangements
were adopted and approved by the Momentive Board or the Compensation Committee of the Momentive
Board, which is composed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line
with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Momentive approve the compensation that will or may become
payable to Momentive’s named executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant
to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger-Interests of Momentive’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” in Momentive’s proxy statement
for the special meeting.”
Momentive’s stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and
as a non-binding, advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Momentive, the Momentive Board or Parent.
Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to
stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is
consummated Momentive’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is
based on or that otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to
those payments.
The Momentive Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

We are asking you to approve any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting. If stockholders approve this proposal, we can adjourn the
special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit
additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly
signed proxies voting against adoption of the merger agreement. Among other things, approval of the
adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to adopt the merger agreement would be
defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and
seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement. Additionally, we may seek stockholder approval to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not
present. The chairperson of the special meeting is permitted by Momentive’s bylaws to adjourn the special
meeting even if Momentive’s stockholders have not approved the proposal to adjourn the special meeting.
The Momentive Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the
merger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified
in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement
as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read
and consider the merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety
because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to
you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger
agreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements described below and included in the merger
agreement (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were
made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to important
qualifications, limitations, and supplemental information agreed to by Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub in
connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a
contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed
with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub
by Momentive in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may
have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between
Momentive and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts. Further, the
representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances
in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or
otherwise. Momentive’s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement
and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements or any descriptions
thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Momentive, Parent, or Merger Sub or
any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. Except where expressly
provided in the merger agreement, none of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the
merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of
the merger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations
on the respective businesses of Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain
actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as
otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the
public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with
information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information
regarding Momentive, Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations,
warranties, covenants, and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you
should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in Momentive’s filings with the SEC
regarding Momentive and Momentive’s business.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub, and Momentive
that is no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the
merger agreement) of the last condition to the closing of the merger (other than those conditions that by
their term are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted under the merger agreement) of such conditions); or (2) at such other time agreed to by
Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub in writing. On the closing date of the merger, the parties will cause the
merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of
that certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at a later time agreed to in
writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL.",107,107

into the contingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of
Momentive common stock subject to such unvested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price,
less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such

agreement, each such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting
terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Momentive restricted stock award immediately prior to

At the effective time of the merger, each vested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive

adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period,
but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed
offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (3) cause the exercise (as of no
later than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger) of each outstanding purchase right
pursuant to the ESPP; and (4) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence
pursuant to the ESPP upon or after the effective time of the merger. The ESPP will terminate as of the

Prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
Momentive, which we refer to as the “payment agent,” to make payments of the merger consideration to
Momentive’s stockholders. At or prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the payment agent an amount of cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the
aggregate merger consideration payable to Momentive’s stockholders in accordance with the merger
agreement.
Promptly (and in any event within one business day) following the effective time of the merger, Parent and
the surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger represented outstanding shares of Momentive common stock (other than excluded shares), a letter
of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender their stock certificates in exchange for
their respective portion of the merger consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for
cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit of loss, together with any required bond); and (2) a duly completed
102TABLE OF CONTENTS
and validly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Momentive common stock represented
by such certificate and (y) the per share price. The amount of any per share price paid to Momentive’s
stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of Momentive common stock held in book-entry form
(which we refer to as “uncertificated shares”) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal (as both are described above) to the payment agent to receive the consideration payable
in respect thereof. Each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of
uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding
share of Momentive common stock (other than excluded shares) will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message”
in customary form at the effective time of the merger, be entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay
and deliver as promptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number
of shares of Momentive common stock represented by such holder’s transferred uncertificated shares; and
(2) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such Momentive stockholders will not include

If any certificates or uncertificated shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which
any cash in respect of such certificate or uncertificated share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any governmental authority, then any such cash in respect of such certificate or uncertificated
share will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving
corporation, or any other party will be liable to any of Momentive’s stockholders with respect to any cash
amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law, or
similar laws.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such
certificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen, or
destroyed, then the payment agent will issue the per share price payable in respect of thereof to such holder
upon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Parent or the
payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the per share price,
require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the payment agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation, or the payment

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “acquisition transaction” means any
transaction or series of related transactions (other than the merger) involving:
•
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or group (other than Parent or
Merger Sub, the Guarantors, or the investment consortium led by STG, or any of their respective
affiliates, or any group that includes any of the foregoing), whether from Momentive or any other
person, of securities representing more than 15 percent of the total outstanding voting power of
Momentive after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or group that, if consummated in
accordance with its terms, would result in such person or group beneficially owning more than 15
percent of the total outstanding voting power of Momentive after giving effect to the consummation
of such tender offer or exchange offer;
•
any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or group (other than Parent,
Merger Sub, the Guarantors, or the investment consortium led by STG, or any of their respective
affiliates, or any group that includes any of the foregoing) of assets (including securities issued by
any of Momentive or its subsidiaries) constituting more than 15% of the consolidated net revenues
or consolidated net income (measured based on the 12 full calendar months prior to the date of
determination) or consolidated assets (measured based on book value or fair market value as of the
last day of the most recently completed calendar month) of Momentive and its subsidiaries, in
each case except for sales or non-exclusive licenses or sublicenses of Momentive’s products in
the ordinary course of business; or
•
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation,
dissolution or other transaction involving Momentive (or any of its subsidiaries whose business
accounts for more than 15 percent of the revenue, net income, or consolidated assets of
Momentive and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) pursuant to which any person or group (other

For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means any written
acquisition proposal, on terms that the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) would be more favorable, from a
financial point of view, to the Momentive stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the merger (taking into
account (i) any revisions to the merger agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of
such determination; and (ii) those factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Momentive
Board (or any committee thereof), which factors may include the (A) identity of the person making the
proposal; (B) likelihood of consummation in accordance with the terms of such acquisition proposal; and (C)
legal, financial (including the financing terms), regulatory, timing and other aspects of such acquisition
proposal). For purposes of the reference to an “acquisition proposal” in this definition, all references to “15

The Momentive Board has recommended that the holders of shares of Momentive common stock vote “FOR”
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, except as set forth below, at no
time after the date of the merger agreement may the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify, or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, the Momentive Board recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent;
•
adopt, approve, or recommend an acquisition proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the Momentive Board recommendation within ten business days of the
occurrence of a material event or development and after Parent so requests in writing (or, if the
Momentive stockholder meeting is scheduled to be held within ten business days, then within one
112TABLE OF CONTENTS
business day after Parent so requests in writing) (it being understood that Momentive will not be
obligated to affirm the Momentive Board recommendation on more than two occasions (other than
in connection with the first public announcement of an acquisition proposal that is not or will not be
a tender or exchange offer));
•
make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or the issuance of a “stop, look, and listen” communication by
the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) to Momentive’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-
9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position
with respect to an acquisition proposal until 2:29 p.m. (California time) on the tenth business day
after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such acquisition proposal
without such action being considered a violation of the applicable covenants under the merger
agreement);
•
fail to include the Momentive Board recommendation in the proxy statement (we refer to the
actions described in these five bullets as a “Momentive Board recommendation change”) (it
being understood that none of (1) the determination in itself by the Momentive Board (or a
committee thereof) that an acquisition proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
superior proposal or (2) the delivery, in itself, by Momentive to Parent or its representatives of any
notice contemplated by applicable provisions of the merger agreement will constitute a Momentive
Board recommendation change or violate applicable covenants under the merger agreement); or
•
cause or permit Momentive or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition
agreement.
At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, other than in connection with an acquisition
proposal, the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Momentive Board recommendation
change in response to an intervening event if and only if:
•
the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Momentive Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable
law;
•
Momentive has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five business days in advance (which
we refer to as the “event notice period”) to the effect that the Momentive Board (or a committee
thereof) has (1) so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Momentive Board recommendation
change, which notice will specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Momentive Board
recommendation change and will describe the intervening event in reasonable detail; and
•
prior to effecting such Momentive Board recommendation change, Momentive and its
representatives, until 5:00 p.m., California time, on the last day of the event notice period, have (1)
negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the
other documents entered into in connection with the merger so that the Momentive Board (or a
committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Momentive Board
recommendation change in response to such intervening event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; (2) permitted Parent and its
representatives to make a presentation to the Momentive Board regarding the merger agreement
and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a
presentation); and
•
following the expiration of the event notice period, the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof)
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account
Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the
transaction documents) has determined that the failure of the Momentive Board (or a committee
thereof) to make a Momentive Board recommendation change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. Each time that material
113
TABLE OF CONTENTS
modifications or developments with respect to the intervening event occur (as reasonably
determined by the Momentive Board in good faith), Momentive has agreed to notify Parent of such
modification and the event notice period will recommence and be extended for three business days
from the later of (A) the delivery of such written notice to Parent; or (B) the end of the original event
notice period.
At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, if Momentive has received a written
acquisition proposal that the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, then the Momentive
Board may (1) effect a Momentive Board recommendation change with respect to such superior proposal; or
(2) authorize Momentive to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition
agreement with respect to such superior proposal, in each case if and only if:
•
the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Momentive Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable
law;
•
Momentive has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the merger
agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal;
•
Momentive has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five business days in advance (the
“notice period”) to the effect that the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) has (1) received a
written acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2) concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal
constitutes a superior proposal; and (3) resolved to effect a Momentive Board recommendation
change or to terminate the merger agreement, which notice describes the basis for such
Momentive Board recommendation change or termination, including the identity of the person or
group making such acquisition proposal, and the material terms of such acquisition proposal will
include copies of final, execution ready versions of all applicable documents relating to such
acquisition proposal; and
•
prior to effecting such Momentive Board recommendation change or termination, Momentive and its
representatives, until 5:00 p.m., California time, on the last day of the notice period, have (1)
negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the
other documents entered into in connection with the merger so that such acquisition proposal
would cease to constitute a superior proposal; (2) permitted Parent and its representatives to make
a presentation to the Momentive Board regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with
respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being
understood that (A) in the event of any material revision, amendment, update, or supplement to
such acquisition proposal, Momentive agreed to be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of the merger agreement with respect to such new
written notice (with the “notice period” in respect of such new written notice being three business
days); and (B) at the end of the notice period, the Momentive Board (or a committee thereof) must
have in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking
into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement)
reaffirmed its determination that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “intervening event” means any effect, or
any material consequence of such effect material to Momentive and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that
(i) as of the date of the merger agreement was not known or reasonably foreseeable, in each case based on
facts known to the Momentive Board as of the date of the merger agreement; and (ii) does not relate to (A)
an acquisition proposal; or (B) the mere fact, in and of itself, that Momentive meets or exceeds any internal
or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the merger agreement, or changes after the
date of the merger agreement in the market price or trading volume of Momentive’s common stock or the
credit rating of Momentive (it being understood that the underlying cause of any of the foregoing in this
clause (B) may be considered and taken into account in determining whether an intervening event has
occurred).

From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to) honor all of Momentive’s Company Employee Plans and compensation and
severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, except that nothing will prohibit the surviving corporation from amending or terminating any such
Company Employee Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or
as otherwise required pursuant to applicable law.
We refer to each individual who is Momentive’s employee or an employee of any of Momentive’s subsidiaries
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and continues to be an employee of Parent or one of its
subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) immediately following the effective time of the merger as a
“continuing employee.”
During the 12-month period following the effective time of the merger, during which a continuing employee
remains employed by the surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries (which we refer to as the “benefits
period”), the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation
and its subsidiaries to) either:
•
maintain for the benefit of each continuing employee the Company Employee Plans and any other
employee benefits plans or other compensation and severance arrangements (other than the
opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits, defined benefits pursuant to qualified and
nonqualified retirement plans, retiree medical benefits, and other retiree health and welfare
arrangements, which we refer to as the “excluded plans”) of the surviving corporation or any of its
subsidiaries (which we refer to as the “Momentive plans”) on terms and conditions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect at Momentive or its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger;
•
provide base compensation, target incentive compensation opportunity and benefits (other than the
opportunity to participate in excluded plans)to each continuing employee that, taken as a whole,
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base compensation, target incentive compensation
opportunity and benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in excluded plans and individual
employment agreements) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger (which we refer to as the “comparable plans”); or
•
provide some combination of Momentive plans and comparable plans such that each continuing
employee receives base compensation, target incentive compensation opportunity and benefits
(other than the opportunity to participate in the excluded plans) that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the base compensation, target incentive compensation opportunity
and benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits) provided to such
continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
In each case, base compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be decreased for a
period of one year following the effective time of the merger for any continuing employee employed during
that period. For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will
(and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) provide to continuing employees severance benefits that
are no less favorable than those provided by Momentive as of the date of the merger agreement.
At or after the effective time of the merger, Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation or any other
subsidiary of Parent to, cause to be granted to continuing employees credit for all service with Momentive
and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger (to the extent that such service was taken into
account under the analogous Momentive plan immediately prior to the effective time of the merger), and with
Parent, the surviving corporation, and any of their subsidiaries on or after the effective time of the merger, for
115TABLE OF CONTENTS
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement) except that such service need not
be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits and service prior to the
effective time of the merger will not be credited for purposes of a defined benefit pension plan.
In addition:
-
each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in
any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its subsidiaries (other than the
Momentive plans) (which we refer to as the “new plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to
any new plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Momentive plan in which such
continuing employee participates immediately before the effective time of the merger (which we
refer to as the “old plans”);
-
for purposes of each new plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other
welfare benefits to any continuing employee, Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation or
any subsidiaries of Parent to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods,
pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work requirements or similar requirements of such new plan are to be
waived for such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents;
-
Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation or any subsidiaries of Parent to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such continuing
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old plan
ending on the date that such continuing employee’s participation in the corresponding new plan
begins to be given full credit pursuant to such new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-
payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such new plan; and
•
Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation or any subsidiaries of Parent to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the accounts of such continuing employees pursuant to
any new plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such
continuing employee.
Any vacation of paid time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be credited to such continuing employee following the effective time of the
merger, will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeitures and will not limit future accruals.
No provision in the merger agreement related to Company Employee Plans (a) guarantees employment for
any period of time for, or precludes the ability of Parent, the surviving corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries to terminate any continuing employee for any reason; (b) subject to the limitations and
requirements specifically set forth in the merger agreement, requires Parent, the surviving corporation, or
any of their respective subsidiaries to maintain or continue any Momentive plan or prevent the amendment,
modification, suspension or termination thereof after the effective time of the merger; (c) creates any third-
party beneficiary rights in any person; or (iv) will be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend,
any Company Employee Plan.

HSR Act; Foreign Direct Investment Laws
Momentive and Parent have each agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to,
as soon as reasonably practicable, cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
pursuant to the HSR Act and to receive consent, approval, or clearance, or the expiration of any applicable
waiting periods under the specified foreign direct investment laws, and any other antitrust law or foreign
direct investment law applicable to the merger.
Momentive and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act
with the FTC and the DOJ on March 24, 2023. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired at
11:59 p.m., California time on April 24, 2023.

In addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with Momentive, submitted the specified foreign direct
investment filing in Italy on April 20, 2023 and may submit additional foreign direct investment filings under
certain circumstances.
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the
extent necessary to obtain clearance consents, approvals, waivers, actions, waiting period expirations or
terminations, non-actions, or other authorizations pursuant to applicable antitrust laws and specified foreign
direct investment laws, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under antitrust laws or
specified foreign direct investment laws applicable to the merger, in each case, as promptly as practicable
so as to allow the consummation of the merger, as promptly as practicable, and in any event at least three
business days prior to the termination date offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise (a) the sale, divestiture, license, or other disposition, of any and all of the
capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products, or
businesses of Parent, Momentive, or their respective subsidiaries; (b) the termination, modification, or
assignment of existing relationships, joint ventures, contracts, or obligations of Parent Momentive or their
respective subsidiaries; (c) the modification of any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent,
Momentive or their respective subsidiaries; and (d) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent,
Momentive, or their respective subsidiaries; provided, however, that nothing in the merger agreement requires
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective affiliates to, and Momentive will not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, commit to or effect any action with respect to the capital stock or other equity or voting
interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products, or businesses of affiliates of
Parent or Merger Sub (other than Parent and Merger Sub and, following the closing, the surviving corporation
and the other Momentive subsidiaries).
Additionally, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed (and will cause the Guarantors, the investment
consortium led by STG and its and their respective affiliates) not to acquire or agree to acquire by merging,
or consolidating with, by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by acquiring in any other
manner, any business of any person or other business organization or division if such business competes in
any line of business with Momentive or its subsidiaries and the entering into a definitive agreement relating
to the consummation of such transaction would reasonably be expected to (1) materially increase the risk of
not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration, or approval of any governmental authority by
the termination date necessary to consummate the merger or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period; (2) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the merger; (3) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise; or (4) materially delay beyond the termination date or prevent the consummation of the
merger, subject to certain exceptions.
Equity Financing and Debt Financing
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the investment consortium led
by STG delivered the equity commitment letter, pursuant to which the investment consortium led by STG
committed to provide Parent, at the effective time of the merger, with an equity investment of approximately
$1.17 billion to fund a portion of the aggregate merger consideration and to pay fees and expenses related to
the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the equity commitment letter. Momentive is a third party
beneficiary of the equity commitment letter and is entitled to enforce the investment commitment, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. Additionally, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, the debt financing sources delivered a debt commitment letter to
Parent dated March 13, 2023, pursuant to which the lenders party to that letter committed to provide Parent,
at the effective time of the merger, with debt financing of $450 million to fund a portion of the aggregate
merger consideration and to refinance Momentive’s existing credit facilities, subject to the terms and
conditions of the debt commitment letter. These financing amounts, together with Momentive’s cash on hand
at closing, will be sufficient to fund the aggregate merger consideration payable to Momentive’s stockholders
and the other payments required to be paid in connection with the completion of the merger (in each case,
pursuant to certain terms and conditions).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to take (or cause to be taken) all
actions and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper, and advisable to obtain the equity

days prior to the termination date, including by:
•
maintaining in effect the equity commitment letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof;

•
complying with its obligations pursuant to the equity commitment letter; and

the equity commitment letter.
Under the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub have agreed not to, without Momentive’s prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the equity
commitment letter.
Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to seek to enforce, including by bringing a legal proceeding for specific
performance, the equity commitment letter if Momentive seeks and is granted a decree of specific
performance of the obligation to consummate the merger after all applicable conditions to the granting
thereof set forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied.
Under the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take
(or cause to be taken) all actions and to do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper and advisable
to arrange and obtain the debt financing on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the
full exercise of any “flex” provisions) described in the debt commitment letters or the fee letters no later than
the closing of the merger, including using reasonable best efforts to
•
maintain in effect the debt commitment letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the

contemplated by the debt commitment letters on the terms and conditions (including the “flex”
provisions) contemplated by the debt commitment letters or the fee letters;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub have agreed not to, without Momentive’s prior
written consent, permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the debt commitment letters if such amendment, modification, or waiver would, or
would reasonably be expected to,
•
reduce the aggregate amount of the debt financing (unless the amount of the equity financing is
increased by an equivalent amount from the investment consortium led by STG as of the date of
the merger agreement);
•
materially delay or prevent the closing of the merger,
•
make the funding of the debt financing materially less likely to occur; or
•
adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or Momentive to consummate the transactions
contemplated under the merger agreement at the closing of the merger or the to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the debt commitment letters or the likelihood of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated under the merger agreement to be consummated at the closing of
the merger.
Parent will promptly provide Momentive with executed copies of any amendments or modifications to the
debt commitment letters and the equity commitment letter.
If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the “flex”
provisions) contemplated in the debt commitment letters, then Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and at least three
business days prior to the termination date, (i) alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in
the debt commitment letters and the fee letters and in an amount at least equal to the debt financing or
such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (which we refer to as the “alternate debt financing”);
and (ii) one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such alternate debt financing (which
we refer to as the “new debt commitment letters”), which new debt commitment letters will replace the
existing debt commitment letters in whole or in part.",123,126

the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to), for a period of six years after the effective time of the
merger, honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of Momentive and its subsidiaries pursuant to any
indemnification agreements between Momentive and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of
their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director, officer of
Momentive or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger), on the other hand (we refer to
such persons collectively as the “indemnified persons”) either set forth on the confidential disclosure letter

the charter, the bylaws, and the other similar organizational documents of Momentive and the subsidiaries of
Momentive, as applicable, as of the date of the merger agreement and honor and fulfill, in all respects, such
indemnification, exculpation, and advancement of expenses provision. During such six-year period or such
period in which an indemnified person is asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to the merger
agreement, whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended, or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any indemnified persons except as required

The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for Momentive and Parent. Upon valid termination
of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, Momentive has agreed to pay Parent (or its
designee) a termination fee of $52.0 million. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable by Momentive
to Parent if the merger agreement is terminated:
•
by Momentive prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Momentive’s stockholders holding
a majority of the outstanding shares of Momentive common stock as of the record date, in order to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal; or
•
by Parent if the Momentive Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger or if
there has been a willful breach of Momentive’s obligations under the merger agreement not to
solicit an alternative transaction in a manner that is material.
•
Momentive also agreed to pay Parent (or its designee) the termination fee in certain circumstances
if:
•
the merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination
date or any relevant extension thereof; (2) because of Momentive’s failure to obtain the required
approval of Momentive’s stockholders; or (3) subject to a 45-day cure period, because Momentive
breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties, or covenants in a manner that
would cause the related closing conditions to not be satisfied;
•
Momentive has not delivered to Parent written notice prior to termination of the merger agreement
of a breach or failure to perform by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective representations,
warranties, or covenants contained in the merger agreement in a manner that would cause the
conditions to Momentive’s obligation to consummate the merger to not be satisfied, or any such
noticed breach or failure to perform was cured prior to, or is otherwise not continuing as of, the
termination of the merger agreement;
•
prior to the termination of the merger agreement, an acquisition proposal has been publicly
announced or publicly disclosed or, in certain circumstances, otherwise provided to the Momentive
Board, and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and
•
within one year of termination of the merger agreement, Momentive consummates, or enters into a
definitive agreement providing for (and such acquisition proposal is subsequently consummated at
any time), a transaction involving the acquisition of at least 50 percent of the outstanding shares of
Momentive common stock or Momentive’s consolidated assets.
The merger agreement also provides that Momentive, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, may specifically enforce the obligations under the merger agreement, except that Momentive
may only cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger, and cause the equity financing under
the equity commitment letter to be funded, if certain conditions are satisfied.
Upon valid termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, Parent has agreed to pay
Momentive a termination fee of $104.0 million, the payment of which has been guaranteed pursuant to and
subject to the terms and conditions of the Limited Guaranty. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable
by Parent to Momentive if the merger agreement is terminated by Momentive if:
•
subject to a 45-day cure period, Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform any of its
respective representations, warranties, or covenants in the merger agreement such that the related
closing condition would not be satisfied; however, Momentive will not be entitled to terminate the
merger agreement pursuant to this provision if, at the time that such termination would otherwise
take effect in accordance with the foregoing, Momentive is in material breach of the merger
agreement such that certain closing conditions are not satisfied; or
•
(1) the conditions to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the merger have been
and continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied if the date of such termination was the
closing date) or waived; (2) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the closing as required
under the merger agreement; (3) Momentive has notified Parent in writing that if Parent performs its
obligations under the merger agreement and the equity financing contemplated by the equity
123TABLE OF CONTENTS
commitment letter and the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter is funded,
then Momentive stands ready, willing, and able to consummate, and irrevocably commits to
consummate, the closing; (4) Momentive gives Parent written notice at least two business days
prior to such termination stating Momentive’s intention to terminate the merger agreement; and (5)
the closing has not been consummated by the end of such two business day period (it being
understood that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, Parent will not
be permitted to terminate the merger agreement during such two business day period).
Subject to limited exceptions, (a) Parent’s and Merger Sub’s aggregate liability for monetary damages for
breaches of the merger agreement are capped at $104.0 million, plus enforcement expenses up to $7.0
million, plus certain reimbursement obligations, and (b) Momentive’s liability for monetary damages for
breaches of the merger agreement is capped at $52.0 million, plus certain enforcement expenses up to $7.0
million.
Neither Parent nor Momentive is required to pay the other its termination fee on more than one occasion.
Momentive’s receipt of the Parent termination fee (including Momentive’s right to enforce the Limited
Guaranty with respect thereto and receive the Parent termination fee from the Guarantors), receipt of certain
reimbursement obligations, and enforcement expenses up to $7.0 million payable by Parent to the extent
owed, and Momentive’s right to specific performance are the sole and exclusive remedies of Momentive and
its affiliates against Parent and its affiliates in respect of the merger agreement, the related transaction
documents, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or such transaction documents, the
termination of the merger agreement or the failure to consummate the merger, other than in the case of fraud
or a willful breach of the merger agreement. Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages
payable by Parent and its affiliates (including for fraud or willful breach) under the merger agreement, the
Limited Guaranty, or the equity commitment letter exceed the parent liability limitation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, under no circumstances can Momentive receive both a grant of specific
performance or other equitable relief to cause the equity financing or the debt financing to be funded
(whether under the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter or the debt commitment letter) and
the occurrence of the closing, on the one hand, and (1) payment of any monetary damages (including any
monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever; or (2) payment of any of the Parent
termination fee, certain reimbursement obligations, and any enforcement expenses by Parent to Momentive,

•
each of Momentive’s named executive officers;
•
each of Momentive’s directors and nominees for director; and

Momentive’s knowledge, the persons and entities named in the table have sole voting power and sole
investment power with respect to all shares that they beneficially owned, subject to community property
laws where applicable.
The calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 150,689,947 shares of Momentive
common stock outstanding as of April 5, 2023 (the “Beneficial Ownership Date”). We have deemed

conditions expected to occur within 60 days of April 5, 2023, to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned
by the person holding the stock option or RSU for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of
that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the
percentage ownership of any other person.

March 13, 2023
Board of Directors 
Momentive Global Inc. 
One Curiosity Way
San Mateo, CA 94403
Members of the Board:
We understand that Momentive Global Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Mercury Bidco LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), and Mercury Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), plan to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) dated as of March 13, 2023, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company (the “Merger”). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the
effective time of the Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of
common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger (such shares, collectively, “Company Common Stock” or “Shares” and each, a
“Share”), other than (i) each Share to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(ii) of the Merger
Agreement and (ii) Dissenting Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $9.46 in cash, without interest (the
“Merger Consideration”), subject to any required Tax (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) withholding
as provided in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger
Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the “Holders”), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated March
13, 2023 (the “Draft Merger Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial
statements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-
looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial
projections and operating data of the Company (the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we discussed the past
and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the
Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and
compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock
with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other
analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed
with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the
Company, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and Board of Directors of the Company,
that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered
thereby. We express no view as to the Company Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. We have
assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the final executed Merger
Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the
receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be
imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in
the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of
the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with
such technology and products.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our
services, a portion of which will become payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger
fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us
for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material
relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company, Parent, Symphony
Technology Group or the other equity co-investors of Parent, or their respective affiliates, pursuant to which
compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates, except that Qatalyst Partners acted as a financial
advisor to the Company in connection with certain shareholder activism and governance matters. Qatalyst Partners
and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or
Parent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these
activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise
effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.

“threatened” will be deemed to be immediately followed by the words “in writing.”
(d) Neither, etc. Not Exclusive. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, “neither,”
“nor,” “any,” “either” and “or” are not exclusive. The rule known as the ejusdem generis rule will not
apply, and accordingly, general words introduced by the word “other” will not be given a restrictive
meaning by reason of the fact that they are preceded by words indicating a particular class of acts,
matters or things.

and does not simply mean “if.”
(f) Dollars. When used in this Agreement, references to “$” or “Dollars” are references to United
States dollars. All amounts in this Agreement will be paid in Dollars, and if any amounts, costs, fees or
expenses incurred by any Party pursuant to this Agreement are denominated in a currency other than
Dollars, to the extent applicable, the Dollar equivalent for such costs, fees and expenses will be
determined by converting such other currency to Dollars at the foreign exchange rates published by
Bloomberg or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source reasonably determined by the
Company, in effect at the time that such amount, cost, fee or expense is incurred. If the resulting
conversion yields a number that extends beyond two decimal points, it will be rounded to the nearest
penny.
(g) Meaning of Terms. The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used in this
Agreement is equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term, and words
denoting any gender include all genders. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of
its other grammatical forms has a corresponding meaning. All terms defined in this Agreement will have
the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant to this
Agreement unless otherwise defined in such certificate or document. References to the “United States”
or abbreviations thereof mean the United States of America and its states, territories and possessions.
(h) References to Persons. References to any Person (including any Party) include references to
such Person’s successors and permitted assigns, and, in the case of any Governmental Authority, to
any Person succeeding to its functions and capacities. It is agreed that a breach of this Agreement by
Merger Sub will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent.
(i) References to Subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this
Agreement to the Subsidiaries of a Person will be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries
of such Person.
(j) Writings. References to “writing” mean the representation or reproduction of words, symbols or
other information in a visible form by any method or combination of methods, whether in electronic form
or otherwise, and including writings delivered by Electronic Delivery. “Written” will be construed in the
same manner.
(k) Legislation; Contracts. A reference to any specific legislation or to any provision of any
legislation includes any amendment to, and any modification, re-enactment or successor thereof, any
legislative provision substituted therefor and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued
thereunder or pursuant thereto, except that, for purposes of any representations and warranties in this
Agreement that are made as a specific date, references to any specific legislation will be deemed to
refer to such legislation or provision (and all rules, regulations, statutory instruments and applicable
guidance, guidelines, bulletins or policies issued or made in connection therewith by a Governmental
Authority) as of such date. References to any agreement or Contract are to that agreement or Contract
as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, and any exhibits, schedules, annexes,
statements of work, riders and other documents attached thereto.

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and each certificate

stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the

if any) will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $9.46,

(or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if

dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect
to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the

all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a Company Stockholder, who has (A) neither voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented to the Merger in writing and (B) properly demanded appraisal of such shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7 but instead,
such Company Stockholder holding or owning the Dissenting Company Shares will be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Such Company Stockholder will be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. However, if, after the Effective Time,
such holder or other applicable Person fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or waives, or otherwise
loses such Person’s right to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such Person is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock will be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price in accordance with this Agreement and will not
thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Company Shares.
(ii) Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal. The Company will give Parent (A) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of
any Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of any
Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer
to settle any such demands for payment in respect of any Dissenting Company Shares. For
purposes of this Section 2.7(c)(ii), “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant
to the DGCL in respect of any Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the attorney-client
privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected) and may
offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands, but Parent will not be afforded any
decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment, settlement
or compromise consent set forth above.

in cash (without interest) equal to (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Vested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the
Per Share Price, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (the
“Vested Company RSU Consideration”).
(ii) Unvested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company RSU under
the applicable Company Equity Plan that is not a Vested Company RSU (an “Unvested Company
RSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted solely into the contingent right to receive from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation an aggregate amount in cash (without interest) (each, a “Converted Cash Award”)
equal to (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Per Share Price, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 2.8, each such Converted Cash Award assumed and converted pursuant to
this Section 2.8 will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and
conditions (including acceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any))
as applied to the corresponding Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with
payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.
(b) Company Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Company
Restricted Stock under the applicable Company Equity Plan (excluding shares of Company Restricted
Stock that vest immediately prior to or as of the Effective Time including as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) will, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to
receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (x) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such outstanding Company Restricted Stock award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as determined in accordance with the applicable award
agreement) multiplied by (y) Per Share Price, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect

(c) Company Options.
(i) Vested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (a “Company Option”) under the applicable Company Equity
Plan that is vested at the Effective Time (a “Vested Company Option”) will, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash, equal to (x) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Vested Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under
such Vested Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment (the “Vested Company Option Consideration”). For the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Option (whether vested or unvested) that has a per Share exercise price that is greater
than or equal to the Per Share Price (an “Underwater Option”) will be cancelled at the Effective
Time for no consideration or payment.
(ii) Unvested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option
under the applicable Company Equity Plan that is not a Vested Company Option or an Underwater
Option (an “Unvested Company Option”) will, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (x) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess of the Per Share Price over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock under such Unvested Company Option, less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8,

such Converted Cash Award assumed and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8 will continue to
have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including acceleration
provisions upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding

(d) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate amount
owed to holders of Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs with respect to such Vested

following the Closing Date, but in no event later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date following
the Closing Date (or, if such date is within three Business Days of the Closing Date, the second

Company Options and Vested Company RSUs will receive a payment from the Surviving Corporation,
through its payroll system or payroll provider, of the Vested Company Option Consideration and Vested
Company RSU Consideration required to be paid to such former holders pursuant to this Section 2.8. To
the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, any distributions to holders of a Converted Cash
Award must be made prior to the date that is five (5) years following the Effective Time and otherwise in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A). The Surviving Corporation will pay
any portion of a Converted Cash Award that vests to the applicable holder thereof no later than the first
regularly scheduled payroll date following the date on which such portion vests (or, if such date is within
three Business Days of the Closing Date, the second regularly scheduled payroll date following the
Closing Date) (but in no event later than December 31 of the year in which the Converted Cash Award
vested) and any portion of a holder’s Converted Cash Award that remains unvested (after giving effect to
any applicable vesting acceleration terms), as of the date of his or her termination of employment or
service, if any, shall be permanently forfeited by such holder and such holder shall have no further rights
in or claims to any such forfeited portion of his or her Converted Cash Award.
(e) Necessary Further Actions. The Company will take all action within its power and authority
reasonably necessary to effect the cancellation of Company Equity Awards as of the Effective Time and
to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). All Company Equity Awards and all Company Equity Plans will
terminate as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger).
(f) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all action that the Company determines to be reasonably necessary to, effective upon the
consummation of the Merger, (i) cause any offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that
otherwise would be outstanding at the Effective Time to be terminated no later than the Closing Date,
but prior to the Effective Time; (ii) make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect
the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or
purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes
pursuant to the ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise (as of no later than the Closing Date, but prior to the
Effective Time) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (iv) provide that no further
offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP upon or after the Effective Time.
On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the
ESPP within each participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution
and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by
Section 2.7. Any interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within one
Business Day), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as
provided in Section 2.11)); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon
surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as
provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed, in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of
such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by
such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor
as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in
respect thereof) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price. The
Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to
cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of Certificates on the amount payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the
Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive
the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated
Shares”) will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Payment Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In
lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated
Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in

customary form (it being understood that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to
have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” or such other
evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled
to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable)
an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share Price. The
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of
Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish
procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior
to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”);
and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment
Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be
paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the aggregate consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and
transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment
of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in
whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.
(f) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the
Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company
Stockholder for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered
immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash
in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after
the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time who have not
theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such
shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for
payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired Companies, (i)
each Company Associate that renders or has rendered services to any of the Acquired Companies that
is or was classified as a Contract Worker or other non-employee status or as an exempt or non-exempt
employee, is properly characterized as such for all purposes (including: (A) for purposes of the Fair
Labor Standards Act and similar applicable state, local, provincial and foreign Laws; (B) applicable Tax
Laws; and (C) unemployment insurance and worker’s compensation obligations), and (ii) the Acquired
Companies have properly classified and treated each such individual in accordance with all applicable
A-40TABLE OF CONTENTS
Laws and for purposes of all applicable Company Employee Plans and perquisites. Between January 1,
2021 and the date of this Agreement, none of the Acquired Companies has received any written notice
from any Person disputing such classification. No Contract Worker is eligible to participate in any
Company Employee Plan.
(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Company Associate has used to use any trade secret,
information or documentation confidential or proprietary to any former employer or other Person for
whom such individual performed services or violated any confidential relationship with any Person in
connection with the development or sale of any product or proposed product, or the development or sale
of any service or proposed service, of any Acquired Company. Each Company Associate is legally
authorized to work in all locations where he or she performs services for the Acquired Companies.
(e) Each Acquired Company is, and since January 1, 2018 each Acquired Company has been, in
compliance with all Employment Laws in all material respects. None of the Acquired Companies has
effectuated or will effectuate a plant closing, termination, relocation, mass layoff, furlough, separation
from position, reduction, or other termination of any current or former employee of any Acquired
Company that has imposed or would impose any obligation or other liability upon any Acquired
Company under WARN or would otherwise require any Acquired Company to notify or consult with,

impact of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability, each of the Acquired Companies has properly accrued in the
ordinary course of business, and has timely made all payments for, all wages, overtime, salaries,
commissions, bonuses, fees and other compensation for any services performed, directly or indirectly,
for any Acquired Company as of the date of this Agreement. None of the Acquired Companies has any
material liability for any arrears of wages, salaries, overtime pay, premium pay, commissions, bonuses,
benefits, severance pay or other amounts, including pursuant to any Contract, policy, practice or
applicable Law, or any Taxes or any penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing. None of the
Acquired Companies has any material liability for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or
maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, worker’s compensation, social security or other benefits or obligations (other than routine
payments to be made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). Except as
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired Companies, each of the Acquired
Companies maintains accurate and complete records of overtime hours worked by each employee
eligible for overtime compensation and compensates all employees in accordance with the
requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the applicable Laws of all jurisdictions where such
Acquired Company maintains employees.
(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2018, no claim of sexual harassment,

Company in such person’s capacity as such or in any other capacity. Since January 1, 2018, no
Acquired Company has entered into any material settlement agreement, tolling agreement, non-
disparagement agreement, confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure agreement, or any Contract or
provision similar to any of the foregoing, relating to any Misconduct Claim against any Acquired
Company or any person who is or was an officer, director, manager, employee or Contract Worker of
any Acquired Company.
(g) Section 3.16(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains an accurate and complete list, as of
the date of this Agreement, of each material Company Employee Plan and each material Company
Employee Agreement that is maintained in the U.S., Canada, The Netherlands and Ireland. None of the
Acquired Companies has committed to establish or enter into any new arrangement that would
constitute a material Company Employee Plan or material Company Employee Agreement, or to
materially modify any material Company Employee Plan or material Company Employee Agreement
(except to conform any such Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement to the
requirements of any applicable Laws). The Company has made available to Parent, in each case, to the
extent applicable: (i) accurate and complete copies of all material documents setting forth the terms of
each material Company Employee Plan and each material Company Employee Agreement, including
A-41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
all material amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent summary plan description, together with
summaries of the material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA with respect to each
material Company Employee Plan; (iii) the most recently filed annual report (Form 5500 Series and all
schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in
connection with each Company Employee Plan; (iv) the trust agreement, insurance Contract or other
funding instrument, if any, with respect to each material Company Employee Plan; (v) all discrimination
tests required under the Code for each Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code for the most recent plan years; and (vi) the most recent IRS determination or opinion
letter issued with respect to each Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code.
(h) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each
Company Employee Plan has been established, maintained and operated in accordance with its terms
and in compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Any Company Employee
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to be qualified
under Section 501(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if
applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event
has occurred since the date of the most recent determination that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect such qualification. Each Foreign Company Plan intended to qualify for special tax
treatment satisfies in all material respects the requirements for such treatment. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no “prohibited transaction,” within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Each
Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in
accordance with its terms, without material liability to Parent, the Acquired Companies or any ERISA
Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses). There is no audit, inquiry or Legal Proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental
Authority with respect to any Company Employee Plan. None of the Acquired Companies or any ERISA
Affiliate has ever incurred any material penalty or Tax with respect to any Company Employee Plan
under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code or any material penalty or Tax
under applicable Laws. Except as would not result in material liability, each of the Acquired Companies
and ERISA Affiliates have timely made all contributions and other payments required by and due under
the terms of each Company Employee Plan, and, to the extent not yet due, such contributions and
other payments have been adequately accrued in the consolidated financial statements (including any
related notes) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Reports. Each Foreign
Company Plan that is required to be registered or approved by any Governmental Authority under
applicable Laws has been so registered or approved.
(i) None of the Acquired Companies, and none of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, or been obligated to contribute to
or has any liability in respect of, any: (i) Company Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code or any Foreign Company Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan; (ii) “multiemployer
plan” within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA; or (iii) plan described in Section 413 of the Code.
No Company Employee Plan is or has been funded by, associated with or related to a “voluntary
employee’s beneficiary association” within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company
Employee Plan subject to ERISA holds stock issued by the Company or any of its current ERISA
Affiliates as a plan asset. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Company Plan, the liability of
each insurer for any Foreign Company Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established
for any Foreign Company Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all current and former participants in
such Foreign Company Plan according to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most
recently used to determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Company
Plan, and none of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will cause any such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.

correct and complete copies of (i) an executed commitment letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, between Parent and certain other parties thereto, including the Guarantors (the “Equity
Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which such other parties thereto (together with each of their
permitted assignees pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter, the “Equity Financing
Sources”) have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or
indirectly, the cash amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding a portion of the aggregate value
of the Merger (the “Equity Financing”); and (ii) executed commitment letters, dated as of the date of
this Agreement, among Parent, Merger Sub and the lenders party thereto (the “Debt Commitment
Letters” and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the “Financing Letters”) pursuant to which
the lenders party thereto (the “Debt Financing Sources”) have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding a portion of the
aggregate value of the Merger (the “Debt Financing” and, together with the Equity Financing, the
“Financing”). Parent has also delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of any fee
letter (which may be delivered with the fee amounts and “flex” terms redacted in a customary manner
so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability
or termination of the Debt Financing) in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters (collectively,
“Fee Letters”). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that (A) the Company is an express third party
beneficiary thereof in connection with the Company’s exercise of its rights under Section 9.10(b); (B)
subject in all respects to Section 9.10(b), Parent and the Equity Financing Sources have waived any
defenses to the enforceability of such third party beneficiary rights; and (C) Parent and the Equity
Financing Sources will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief in connection with the exercise by Company of such third party beneficiary rights.

and the terms of the Financing have not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement;

Agreement); and (iii) the respective commitments contained in the Financing Letters have not been
withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or rescinded in any respect, and, to Parent’s knowledge, no such
withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission is contemplated. There are no Contracts, agreements,
side letters or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to the funding, investing
or use, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letters and any Fee Letters.
(c) Sufficiency of Financing. The aggregate amounts committed pursuant to the Financing Letters
are sufficient to (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar
premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of “flex” (including original issue
discount “flex”) provided under the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters) (i) make all payments
contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Merger (including the payment of all amounts
A-48TABLE OF CONTENTS
payable pursuant to Article II in connection with or as a result of the Merger); (ii) repay, prepay or
discharge (after giving effect to the Merger) the principal of and interest on, and all other indebtedness
outstanding pursuant to, the Credit Agreement, subject to and including any cash collateral required in
connection with letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement that will remain outstanding after
the Closing Date; and (iii) pay all fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the Merger and the
Financing.
(d) Solvency. Assuming the accuracy of each of the Company’s representations in Article III at and
after the Closing, Parent and the Company and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will, after
giving effect to the Merger, including the funding of the Financing and payment of all other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger, including the payment of all
related fees and expenses, be Solvent at and immediately after the Closing. The term “Solvent” shall
mean, with respect to a particular date, that on such date, (i) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation,
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will exceed their
debts, (ii) Parent and, after the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (on a
consolidated basis) has not incurred and does not intend to incur, and does not believe that it will incur,
debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and (iii) Parent has and, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will have, sufficient
capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this Section 4.10(d), “debt”
means any liability on a claim, and “claim” means any (i) right to payment, whether or not such a right
is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and (ii) any right to an equitable remedy for breach
of performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy
is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or
unsecured.
(e) Validity; No Contrary Expectation. The Financing Letters and the Fee Letters (each in the forms
delivered by Parent to the Company) are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto (including, with respect to the
Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity Financing Sources), as applicable, enforceable against Parent,
Merger Sub and the other parties thereto, as applicable, in accordance with their terms, except, in each
case, as enforcement may be limited by Enforceability Exceptions. Other than as expressly set forth in
the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full proceeds of the Financing (including any “flex” provisions) pursuant to
any agreement relating to the Financing to which the Equity Financing Sources, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates is a party. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent, Merger
Sub, any Equity Financing Source nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Financing
Letters, as applicable, has committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations set forth
in, or is in default under, any of the Financing Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) constitute or result in a breach or default
on the part of any Person under any of the Financing Letters or the Fee Letters; (ii) constitute or result
in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Letters or the Fee
Letters; (iii) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Letters
inaccurate in any material respect; or (iv) otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not being
available. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after giving
effect to any “flex” provisions in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Fee Letters) that (A) it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing to be satisfied by it, whether
or not such term or condition is contained in the Financing Letters or the Fee Letters; or (B) the full
amounts committed pursuant to the Financing Letters will not be available as of the Closing if the terms
or conditions contained in the Financing Letters to be satisfied by it are satisfied. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or other
fees, expenses, premiums and charges that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters. Other than as set forth
in the Financing Letters, there are no conditions precedent related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing.

(a) No Solicitation. Subject to Section 5.4(b), following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and the executive officers and directors of
the Company, and will instruct its legal and financial advisors and use reasonable best efforts to cause
each of its other Representatives (other than its non-controlled Affiliates that are not directors, officers
or employees of the Company) to, cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with, and terminate any data room access (or other access to diligence) of, any Person and its
Representatives relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Transaction. Unless the Company has already so requested, promptly following the date of this
Agreement, the Company will request that each Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) that
has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition
Transaction promptly return or destroy, in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement,
all non-public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries

knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person or Group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Representatives) any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford to any Person or Group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or the making
of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate,
engage in or knowingly facilitate discussions or negotiations with any Person or Group with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to the making of an
Acquisition Proposal; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is

intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract
relating to an Acquisition Transaction, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”); or (vi) authorize or
commit to do any of the foregoing. Following the date of this Agreement, the Company will not be
required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any “standstill” provision in any confidentiality
agreement to the extent that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal
being made to the Company Board, if the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law.
(b) Permitted Conduct Related to Certain Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.4, from the date of this Agreement until the Company’s receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or
indirectly through one or more of their respective Representatives (including Qatalyst Partners),
discuss, negotiate and enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and, subject to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (i) participate or engage in other discussions or negotiations

afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to

Superior Proposal by, in each case, any Person or Group or their respective Representatives that has
made, renewed or delivered to the Company an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement
that was not solicited in material breach of Section 5.4(a). The Company and the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may only take the actions contemplated by the preceding sentence (including the
initial negotiation of an
A-54TABLE OF CONTENTS
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (B) the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.4(b) would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law.
(c) No Company Board Recommendation Change or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement. Except as provided by Section 5.4(d), at no time after the date of this Agreement may the
Company Board (or a committee thereof):

amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; (B)
adopt, approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days of the occurrence of a material event or

requests in writing) (it being understood that the Company will not be obligated to affirm the
Company Board Recommendation on more than two occasions (other than in connection with the
first public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal that is not or will not be a tender or exchange
offer)); (D) make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or the issuance of a “stop, look and listen” communication by
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-
9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until 2:29 p.m. (California time) on the 10th Business Day
after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this Section 5.4); or (E) fail to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A)
through (E), a “Company Board Recommendation Change”), it being understood that none of
(1) the determination in itself by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal or (2) the delivery, in
itself, by the Company to Parent or its Representatives of any notice contemplated by Section
5.4(d) will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.4; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.
(d) Permissible Company Board Recommendation Change and Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(i) Intervening Events. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, other than in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if and only if:
(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law;
(2) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days
(the “Event Notice Period”) in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has (A) so determined and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change pursuant to this Section 5.4(d)(i), which notice will specify in reasonable detail the
basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change and will describe the Intervening
Event in reasonable detail;
(3) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and
its Representatives, until 5:00 p.m. (California time) on the last day of the Event Notice Period,
have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
A-55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; and (B)
permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board
regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent
requests to make such a presentation); and
(4) following the Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account
Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents) has determined that the failure of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law, it being understood that each
time that material modifications or developments with respect to the Intervening Event occur
(as reasonably determined by the Company Board in good faith), the Company shall notify
Parent of such modification and the time period set forth in the preceding clause (2) shall
recommence and be extended for three Business Days from the later of (i) the delivery of such
written notice to Parent or (ii) the end of the original Event Notice Period.
(ii) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a
written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
with respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:
(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law;
(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.4 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
(3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in
advance (the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
has (A) received a written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h),
which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or
termination, including the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal
and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and will include copies of final, execution
ready versions of all applicable documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and
(4) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the
Company and its Representatives, until 5:00 p.m. (California time) on the last day of the
Notice Period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the
extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (B) permitted Parent and its
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and
any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a
presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any material revision, amendment,
update or supplement to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a
new written notice to
A-56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.4(d)(ii)(4) with respect to such
new written notice (with the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice being three
Business Days); and (b) following the Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) must have in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents) reaffirmed its determination that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
(e) Notice to Parent of Acquisition Proposals. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will
promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours from the receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if to the
Knowledge of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal is received by the Company or any of its
Representatives or any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives, which requests,
discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice must include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal or request (unless
such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person
or Group that is in effect on the date of this Agreement); (B) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such proposal or request and, if in writing, a copy thereof; and (C) copies of any material
agreements, documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith. Thereafter, the
Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours
of any material development with respect to, or material amendment of such, proposal or request), of
the status and terms of any such proposal (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations, including providing copies of any new or amended material
agreements, documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith. During the Pre-
Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) make available to Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such
Person or Group or its Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent or its
Representatives.
(f) Permitted Disclosures by the Company and the Company Board. So long as the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such public
disclosure (other than in a customary “stop, look and listen” communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act), and without limiting or
otherwise adversely affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.4 or otherwise permitting the Company or the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other
than in accordance with Section 5.4(d):
(i) nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, including making a “stop, look and listen” communication by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); (B) complying
with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (C) making any
disclosure to the Company Stockholders (including regarding the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Acquired Companies) that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof), after consultation with its outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith is required
by applicable Law; and
(ii) it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate
public statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that (A)
describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; (B) identifies the Person or Group
making such Acquisition Proposal; (C) provides the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal; or
(D) describes the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in any case, be
deemed to be (1) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, qualification or modification, or proposal
by the
A-57

Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the
Company Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a Company Board Recommendation Change.
(g) Breach of No-Solicitation Obligations by Representatives of the Company. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary herein, the Company agrees that if (i) any Subsidiary, director or executive
officer of the Company takes any action or (ii) it authorizes, directs or is made aware of an action by
one of its other Representatives and does not use its reasonable best efforts to prohibit or terminate
such action, and, in each case, such action would constitute a material breach of this Section 5.4 if
taken by the Company during the Pre-Closing Period, then such action will be deemed to constitute a
breach by the Company of this Section 5.4.

on the one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, will use (and will
cause its respective Affiliates, including their UPE, if applicable, to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to (x) file a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the Merger as
required by the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ within 10 Business Days
following the date of this Agreement (unless Parent and the Company agree to file such form at a later
date) and (y) as promptly as reasonably practicable submit all notification filings, forms and
submissions with any Governmental Authority pursuant to any other Antitrust Laws and each Foreign
Direct Investment Law specified in Section 7.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (a “Specified
Foreign Direct Investment Law”). Each of Parent and the Company will (and will cause each of its
respective Representatives, as applicable, to) (A) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making
of such filings; (B) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply the other (or cause the other to
be supplied) any information that may be required in order to make such filings; (C) use its respective
reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause the other to be supplied) with any additional information that

efforts to take all action necessary to, as soon as reasonably practicable, cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and to receive consent, approval
or clearance, or the expiration of any applicable waiting periods, under any other Antitrust Laws or the
Foreign Direct Investment Laws applicable to the Merger. If any Party receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or Foreign Direct Investment Laws applicable to
the Merger, then such Party will make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response to such request, and cooperate and
coordinate with the other Parties in connection with responding to any such request. Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not to, (a) “pull-and-refile”
pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 or otherwise withdraw any filing under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law, as the case may be, unless the other Parties have consented in writing to such withdrawal and
refiling (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); or (b) extend any
waiting or review period under any Antitrust Law or Foreign Direct Investment Laws applicable to the
Merger or enter into any timing agreement or other agreement not to consummate the Merger with any
Governmental Authority, unless the other Parties have consented in writing to such extension or
agreement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
(b) Efforts to Cause the Closing. In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 6.2(a), if and to the
extent necessary to obtain clearances, consents, approvals, waivers, actions, waiting period
expirations or terminations, non-actions or other authorizations pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws
and Foreign Direct Investment Laws, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
Antitrust Laws and Foreign Direct Investment Laws applicable to the Merger, in each case as promptly
as practicable so as to allow the consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable, and in any
event at least three Business Days prior to the Termination Date, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise: (i) the sale,

interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) the termination, modification, or assignment of existing
relationships, joint ventures, Contracts, or obligations of Parent, the Company or their respective

Company or their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall
require Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates to, and the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, commit to or effect any action with respect to the capital stock or other
equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products or
businesses of Affiliates of Parent

or Merger Sub (other than Parent and Merger Sub and, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
and the other Acquired Companies). Parent shall oppose any request for, the entry of, and seek to have
vacated or terminated, any order, judgment, decree, injunction or ruling of any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Merger that would restrain, prevent or delay any required consents, clearances,
approvals, waivers, actions, waiting period expirations or terminations, non-actions or other
authorizations applicable to the Merger, including by defending through litigation, any action asserted
by any Person in any court or before any Governmental Authority and by exhausting all avenues of
appeal, including appealing properly any adverse decision or order by any Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to enter into any agreement, consent decree or order with any Governmental
Authority that is not conditioned on the Closing.
(c) Cooperation. In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 6.2(a) and Section 6.2(b), the
Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to), and Parent and Merger Sub will (and will cause their
respective Affiliates to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, (i) promptly notify the other
Parties of (and, if in writing, furnish them with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise
them of the contents of)) any material communication received by such Person from a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance
(and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed
draft notifications, formal notifications, filings, submissions or other written communications (and any
analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other documents submitted
therewith) made in connection with the Merger to a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties
reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and any developments, meetings or discussions

commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or
administrative or judicial action or proceeding under applicable Law; and (D) the nature and status of
any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger; and (iii) where such Party itself has notice, not independently participate in any
hearing, meeting, proceeding or discussions, in each case with or before any Governmental Authority in
respect of the Merger without giving the other Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting, hearing,
proceeding or discussion, and unless (1) prohibited by such Governmental Authority or (2) the meeting,
hearing, proceeding or discussion is with a foreign Governmental Authority related to Foreign Direct
Investment Laws, the opportunity to attend or participate, provided however, unless not practicable
given the timing of the request for a meeting from a foreign Government Authority received by a Party
(the “Notified Party”), such Notified Party shall notify the other Party of such request, and shall
consider in its sole and reasonable discretion in good faith, any request of the other Party to attend or
participate in such meeting. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may designate any non-
public information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to “outside counsel” only and
any such information will not be shared with the Representatives of the other Party without approval of
the Party providing the non-public information. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may
redact or otherwise withhold any personal information or any valuation and related information before
sharing any information provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an “outside
counsel” only basis.
(d) Controlling Provision(e) . This Section 6.2 and not Section 6.1, shall govern and define the
obligations of the Parties with respect to making any filings, notifications with respect to, or obtaining
any approvals under, the HSR Act, other Antitrust Laws and Foreign Direct Investment Laws.",204,205

Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. Except
in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or thereafter, the Company may not file

the Company or its counsel.

to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or
otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials with
the SEC or otherwise. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which will not be unreasonably

6.5 Financing.
(a) No Amendments to Financing Letters. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will not, without the
Company’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Equity Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not, without the Company’s prior written consent,
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant
to, the Debt Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably
be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the amount of the Equity
Financing is increased by an equivalent amount from the Equity Financing Sources as of the date
hereof); (ii) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (iii) make the funding of the Debt Financing
materially less likely to occur; or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
to consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement at the Closing or the to enforce its

contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 6.5 and
(2) “Equity Commitment Letter,” “Debt Commitment Letters,” “Fee Letters” or “Financing Letters” will

replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with alternative financing commitments pursuant to
Section 6.5(d).
(b) Taking of Necessary Actions.
(i) Equity Financing not a Closing Condition. The Equity Financing Sources, Parent and
Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that funding of the Equity Financing is not a condition to
the Closing or the enforcement of the Guarantee. If the Equity Financing has not been funded,
Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger, including by taking the actions
required to be taken by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.5(b)(ii).
(ii) Equity Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub will take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all

and to do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and obtain
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the full exercise
of
A-63
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any “flex” provisions) described in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Fee Letters no later than
the Closing, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate, execute
and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions (including the “flex” provisions) contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters or the Fee Letters; (iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent
all “flex” provisions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or the Fee Letters and the Debt

detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing; and (ii) provide the Company with copies of all

of (upon becoming aware of) termination of the Financing Letters by any party to the Financing Letters
or definitive agreements related to the Financing; (C) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates of any written notice or communication from any Financing Source with respect to (1) any
actual or potential breach (or threatened breach), default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any
party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of
the Financing Letters or such definitive agreements or (2) any dispute between or among any parties to
the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing; and (D) if for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or
any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent will provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as
soon as reasonably practical (but in any event with two Business Days) after the date that the
Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.5(c)
to the contrary, in no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information that Parent
determines, in good faith and after consultation with its outside legal counsel, would result in any
violation or breach of any applicable legal privileges (including attorney-client privilege) if so disclosed, it
being understood that, in each case Parent shall give notice to the Company of the fact that it is
withholding such information, and use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements to permit the disclosure of such information without violating or breaching such privilege.
(d) Alternate Debt Financing. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, if any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the “flex”
provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, then Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and at
least three Business Days prior to the Termination Date, (i) alternative financing from alternative sources
on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than
those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters and in an amount at least equal
to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the “Alternate Debt
Financing”); and (ii) one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt
Financing (the “New Debt Commitment Letters”), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace
the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any
New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which may be delivered with
the fee amounts and “flex” terms redacted in a customary manner so long as no redaction covers terms
that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination of the Alternate Debt

Financing) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any
reference in this Agreement to the “Financing Letters,” “Fee Letters” or the “Debt Commitment Letters”
will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters and Fee Letters, as applicable, to the extent
not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letters or Fee Letters, as applicable, to the extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in
this Agreement to the “Financing” or the “Debt Financing” will mean the debt financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.",207,210

advisory services to any Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company

by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of

(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to), for a period of six years after the Effective Time, honor
and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Acquired Companies pursuant to (i) any indemnification
agreements between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their
respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of

not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Person except as required by applicable Law.

this Section 6.10(b), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300
percent amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the
D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), the Company may, and at Parent’s request will,
purchase a prepaid “tail” policy (the “Tail Policy”) with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for the Tail Policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, and if the cost does exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, obtain a tail policy with the

Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person.

Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Company Employee Plans and
compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including by taking such actions, if any, as are required pursuant to

nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such Company
Employee Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if
otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.
(b) Employment; Benefits. During the twelve (12) months following the Effective Time during which
a Continuing Employee remains employed by the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Company Employee
Plans and any other employee benefit plans or other compensation and severance arrangements (other
than the opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits, defined benefits pursuant to qualified and
nonqualified retirement plans, retiree medical benefits, and other retiree health and welfare
arrangements) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Plans”) on terms
and conditions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect at the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) provide base compensation, target incentive
compensation opportunity and benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based
benefits, defined benefits pursuant to qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, retiree medical
benefits, and other retiree health and welfare arrangements) to each Continuing Employee that, taken

compensation opportunity and benefits (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based
benefits, defined benefits pursuant to qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, retiree medical
benefits, and other retiree health and welfare arrangements and individual employment agreements)
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Comparable Plans”);
or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that each Continuing
Employee receives base compensation, target incentive compensation opportunity and benefits (other
than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits, defined benefits pursuant to qualified and
nonqualified retirement plans, retiree medical benefits, and other retiree health and welfare
arrangements) that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base
compensation, target incentive compensation opportunity and benefits (other than the opportunity to
participate in equity-based benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not
be decreased for a period of one year following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee
employed during that period. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide to Continuing Employees

date of this Agreement.

any other Subsidiary of Parent to, cause to be granted to the Continuing Employees credit for all
service with the Acquired Companies prior to the Effective Time (to the extent that such service was
taken into account under the analogous Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time) and with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement), except that such
service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits and
service prior to the Effective Time will not be credited for purposes of a defined benefit pension plan. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be
immediately eligible to

participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the
“Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision,
disability or other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting
periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii)
Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that
is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any
vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, will not be
subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals.
(d) No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, neither this Section 6.11 nor any provisions of this Agreement relating to Company

forth in this Section 6.11, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective

of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination
Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these agreements,

forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in
Section 8.3(c) or any portion thereof, as applicable, then the non-paying party will pay or cause to be
paid to the other party the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) of the other party in connection with such Legal
Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the

figure is published by The Wall Street Journal) on the date that such payment or portion thereof was
required to be made) plus five percent through the date that such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (collectively,
“Enforcement Expenses”); provided, however, that in no event shall the Enforcement Expenses
exceed $7,000,000.
(f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) For the Company Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1 in circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section
8.3(c), the Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee (including, without duplication, the
Company’s right to enforce the Guarantee with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination
Fee from the Guarantors), the Reimbursement Obligations, any Enforcement Expenses and the
Company’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10(b) will be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties in respect of this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the
Merger. Upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to Section
8.3(c)), the Reimbursement Obligations and any Enforcement Expenses, none of the Parent
Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties or
any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or for any matters
forming the basis of such termination, except that (A) the Parties or their respective Affiliates (or
both) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Acquired Companies may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2 and Section 8.3(a), as
applicable; and (B) the Guarantors will remain obligated, and the Acquired Companies may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section
8.3(f)(i) will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors from any liability (1) for any Fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement, except that under no circumstances will the collective monetary
damages payable by the Parent Related Parties (including for any Willful Breach or Fraud) under
this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
Agreement), the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount, in the aggregate,
equal to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee plus the Reimbursement Obligations plus any
Enforcement Expenses (such aggregate amount, the “Parent Liability Limitation”); (2) for any
breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement; or (3) pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable. In no
event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary
recovery or award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation (except pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable) against the Parent Related Parties, and,
other than pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable,
in no event will the Company be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind,
including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in

excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to,
this Agreement, the Merger, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter, the
Guarantee or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Guarantee, the termination
of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or any claims or actions under applicable
Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Nothing in this Section 8.3(f)(i) will
preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under the
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or limit the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any
Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing.
(ii) For the Parent Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
8.1 in circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b),
Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee, any Enforcement Expenses and Parent’s right to
specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10(b) will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the

hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger
and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or waived by

the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; and (C) the Company has notified

seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement,
