Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger,
each share of Sumo Logic common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger (other than excluded shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to $12.05, less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to this amount as the “per share price.” By “excluded
shares” we mean shares of Sumo Logic common stock that are (1) held by Sumo Logic as treasury stock; (2) owned
by Parent or Merger Sub; (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger; or (4) held by persons who have (a) neither voted in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement or the merger nor consented thereto in writing; and (b) properly demanded
appraisal of such shares of Sumo Logic common stock pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 262 of the DGCL.
At or prior to the closing, an amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent that is sufficient to
pay the aggregate per share price. Once a stockholder has provided the payment agent with any documentation
required by the payment agent, the payment agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate
per share price in exchange for the shares of Sumo Logic common stock held by that stockholder. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Payment Agent, Exchange
Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share price for each share of Sumo Logic
common stock that you own, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that Sumo Logic’s
stockholders holding shares with respect to which an appropriate person has properly and validly exercised and
perfected, and has not validly withdrawn or otherwise lost, their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a
payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by
the DGCL, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Appraisal Rights”).

2023, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and

opinion, the per share price of $12.05 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock

from a financial point of view of the per share price of $12.05 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of
Sumo Logic common stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement as
of the date of the opinion and does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative

(without interest) from Parent or the surviving corporation (which we refer to as a “converted cash award”)

terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding unvested Sumo Logic RSU immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger.
Treatment of Sumo Logic Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
•
Each Sumo Logic restricted stock unit award that is subject to any performance-based vesting conditions
(which we refer to as a “Sumo Logic PSU”) and that is fully vested (but not yet settled) at the effective

Logic common stock subject to such vested Sumo Logic PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms
of the applicable award agreement), multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.

vesting conditions) as applied to the corresponding unvested Sumo Logic PSU immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger.
Treatment of Sumo Logic Options
•
Each outstanding Sumo Logic stock option (which we refer to as a “Sumo Logic option”) that is vested at
the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as a “vested Sumo Logic option”), will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of

if any, of the per share price over the exercise price per share of such vested Sumo Logic option, less
applicable withholding taxes.
•

individuals will be permitted to enroll in Sumo Logic’s 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (which we
refer to as the “ESPP”) on or following the date of the merger agreement; (2) make any adjustments that may be
necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for
all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (3) not allow any increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction
elections under the ESPP during the offering period or purchase period that is in effect on the date of the merger
agreement (which we refer to as the “current purchase period”); (4) cause the exercise (as of no later than one
business day prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the

period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP on or after the date of the merger agreement; and (6)

6TABLE OF CONTENTS
nothing will prohibit Parent or the surviving corporation or their affiliates from amending, modifying, or terminating
any Sumo Logic benefit plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or as
otherwise required pursuant to applicable law.
We refer to each individual who is Sumo Logic’s employee or an employee of any of Sumo Logic’s subsidiaries
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and continues to be an employee of Parent or one of its
subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) immediately following the effective time of the merger as a
“continuing employee.”
For the period beginning on the effective time of the merger and ending on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of
such date, or, if earlier, the date on which a continuing employee’s employment is terminated (which we refer to as the
“benefits period”), the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will:

benefit pension, retiree or post-employment welfare or nonqualified deferred compensation (which we refer
to collectively as the “excluded benefits”)) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in
effect at Sumo Logic or its subsidiaries on the date of the merger agreement;
•
provide an annual base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and target annual cash bonus or commission
opportunity to each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, is substantially the same in the aggregate
to that provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger; and
•
provide to continuing employees with cash severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of
employment (subject to satisfying any requirements required by Parent) that are substantially the same as
those provided by Sumo Logic and its subsidiaries as of the date of the merger agreement under the Sumo
Logic benefit plans listed on the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement.
At or after the effective time of the merger, Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation or any other subsidiary
of Parent to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be granted to continuing employees credit for all service
with Sumo Logic and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger, and with Parent, the surviving
corporation, and any of their subsidiaries on or after the effective time of the merger, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement (but
not including for any purpose of any excluded benefits), to the same extent such service was credited under the
corresponding Sumo Logic benefit plan in which such continuing employee participated immediately prior to the date
of the merger agreement, except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication
of coverage or benefits or could apply to any defined benefit pension plans.
Additionally, Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that:
•
each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and
all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its subsidiaries (other than the excluded benefits)
(which we refer to as the “new plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any new plan replaces
coverage pursuant to a comparable Sumo Logic benefit plan in which such continuing employee
participates immediately before the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as the “old plans”);
•
for purposes of new plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any continuing
employee, all pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements of such new plan are to be waived for such
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents, to the same extent waived under the
corresponding Sumo Logic benefit plan;
•
during the plan year in which the closing of the merger occurs, cause any eligible expenses paid by such
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old plan
ending on the date that such continuing employee’s participation in the corresponding new plan begins to
be given full credit pursuant to such new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new
plan; and

interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the following:
•
For Sumo Logic’s current executive officers, the treatment of their outstanding awards of restricted stock
units and options, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity
Awards.”
•
For Sumo Logic’s non-employee directors, the accelerated vesting, at or immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger, of Sumo Logic RSUs and Sumo Logic options, and the treatment of such equity awards,
as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Sumo
Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity Awards.”
•
The entitlement of each of Sumo Logic’s executive officers to receive payments and benefits pursuant to
change in control and severance agreements if, during the period beginning three months before Sumo
Logic’s change in control and ending 18 months after Sumo Logic’s change in control, Sumo Logic
terminates their employment with Sumo Logic for a reason other than “cause” (excluding by reason of
death or disability) or they resign for “good reason,” in each case as set forth in the executive officer’s
change in control and severance agreement.
•
The continued indemnification and insurance coverage for Sumo Logic’s directors and executive officers
from the surviving corporation and Parent under the terms of the merger agreement.
Appraisal Rights",18,18
"Sumo Logic, Inc._20230405_DEFM14A_20779809_4641204.Pdf",Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, Sumo Logic’s stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of capital stock)
who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their applicable shares of
Sumo Logic common stock through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly demand appraisal of their shares; (4)
meet certain statutory requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or
otherwise lose their rights to appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Sumo Logic common stock
in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the
DGCL are satisfied. This means that these persons will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Sumo Logic common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with
(unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the
amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to persons seeking appraisal,
interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to
such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons who wish to seek appraisal of their
shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would
receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
8TABLE OF CONTENTS
Only a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights,
such person must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Sumo Logic before the vote is taken on the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement; (3) continue to hold of record or own beneficially the subject shares of Sumo Logic common stock
through the effective time of the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal
rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss
of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Sumo
Logic unless certain conditions are satisfied by the persons seeking appraisal, as described further below. The
requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy
statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL. Pursuant to Subsection (d)(1) of
Section 262 of the DGCL, this proxy statement is to include either a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL or information

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for
such U.S. holder’s shares of Sumo Logic common stock in the merger generally will result in the recognition of gain
or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. holder receives in
the merger and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Sumo Logic common stock surrendered in the
merger.
A Non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the
exchange of Sumo Logic common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. holder has certain connections
to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. holder complies with certain
certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income

The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment of consideration due to Sumo
Logic’s stockholders, holders of Sumo Logic warrants, and the holders of Sumo Logic’s equity awards under the
merger agreement, will be funded with the proceeds of committed equity financing and Sumo Logic’s cash on hand at
the closing, as further described below.
Pursuant to an equity commitment and guarantee agreement (which we refer to as the “equity commitment letter”),
the Guarantors have committed to capitalize Parent on the closing on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the equity commitment letter. This amount, together with Sumo Logic’s cash on hand at closing, will be sufficient
to fund the aggregate purchase price and the other payments contemplated by the merger agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the equity commitment letter, the Guarantors have agreed to guarantee the due, punctual,
and complete payment of certain of the liabilities and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the merger
agreement plus amounts in respect of certain reimbursement obligations of Parent and Merger Sub for certain costs,
expenses, or losses incurred or sustained by Sumo Logic, as specified in the merger agreement.

In connection with entering into the merger agreement, on February 9, 2023, following approval thereof by the Sumo
Logic Board, Sumo Logic’s directors, in each case solely in their capacities as stockholders of Sumo Logic, entered
into voting agreements (which we refer to as the “voting agreements”) with Parent. The voting agreements obligate
the applicable stockholders to vote their respective shares of Sumo Logic common stock in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement and for any proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting to a later date if Sumo Logic or
Parent proposes or requests such postponement or adjournment in accordance with the merger agreement, and
against any action, agreement, or proposal that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the merger. The voting agreements terminate in certain circumstances, including
in connection with the valid termination of the merger agreement. The voting agreements also contain restrictions on
the transfer of shares of Sumo Logic common stock held by the stockholders party thereto, subject to certain
exceptions.
The voting agreements cover approximately 2.6 percent of the number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock issued
and outstanding as of the record date. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The

From the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier termination of the merger
agreement) (which we refer to as the “no-shop period”) Sumo Logic agreed to, and agreed to (1) cause its subsidiaries
and its executive officers and directors; (2) instruct its legal and financial advisors; and (3) use reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its other representatives (subject to certain exceptions) to, in each case, cease and cause to
be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room access (or other access to
diligence) of any person and its representatives relating to an acquisition transaction.
In particular, under and subject to the terms of the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the
earlier to occur of the effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, Sumo Logic, its
subsidiaries, and their respective directors and executive officers, will not, and Sumo Logic will not authorize or direct
any of its and its subsidiaries’ other employees, consultants, or other representatives to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission, or announcement of, or knowingly encourage,
facilitate, or assist, any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition
proposal;
•
furnish to any person or group (other than Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective representatives)
any non-public information relating to Sumo Logic or any of its subsidiaries or afford to any person or
group (other than Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective representatives) access to the business,

induce the making, submission, or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an
acquisition proposal or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal;
•
knowingly participate, facilitate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any person or group with
respect to an acquisition proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third persons relating to the making
of an acquisition proposal, subject to certain exceptions under the merger agreement;
•
approve, endorse, or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal;
•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, or
other contract relating to an acquisition transaction, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement (we
refer to any of these as an “alternative acquisition agreement”); or
•
authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.
However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Sumo Logic’s stockholders, if (1) any person or group or
their respective representative makes, renews or delivers to Sumo Logic an acquisition proposal that was not
solicited in material breach of the applicable restrictions; and (2) the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (A) such
acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and
(B) the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable law, Sumo Logic and the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through
one or more of their representatives (including its financial advisor):
•
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with such person or their representative;
•
subject to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, (1) furnish any non-public information relating to Sumo
Logic or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records, or
other non-public information or to any personnel of Sumo Logic or any of its subsidiaries to such person or
their representative; or
•
otherwise facilitate the making of a superior proposal by such person or their representative.
Sumo Logic is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal
unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations
with Parent during a specified period. If Sumo Logic terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior
proposal from a third party, it must pay a termination fee to Parent. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-No Solicitation of Other Acquisition Offers.”

agreement or take certain similar actions other than, under certain circumstances, if it (or a committee of the Sumo

failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Sumo Logic Board’s fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law; and (2) the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) complies in all material respects

Moreover, the Sumo Logic Board cannot withdraw its recommendation that Sumo Logic’s stockholders adopt the
merger agreement or take certain similar actions unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement,
including engaging in good faith negotiations with Parent during a specified period. If Sumo Logic or Parent
terminates the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including because the Sumo Logic Board withdraws its

The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for Sumo Logic and Parent. Upon valid termination of the
merger agreement under specified circumstances, Sumo Logic agreed to pay Parent (or its designee) a termination fee
of $52.0 million. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable by Sumo Logic to Parent if the merger agreement is
terminated:
•
by Sumo Logic prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Sumo Logic stockholders, in order to enter
into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal; or
•
by Parent if the Sumo Logic Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger.
The termination fee will also be payable by Sumo Logic in certain circumstances if:
•
the merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination date at a
time when Sumo Logic’s stockholders have not adopted the merger agreement at the special meeting; (2)
because of Sumo Logic’s failure to obtain the required approval of Sumo Logic’s stockholders; or (3)
subject to a 45-day cure period, because Sumo Logic breaches or fails to perform in any material respect
any of its representations, warranties, or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing
conditions to not be satisfied;
•
at the time of such termination, certain conditions to the closing under the merger agreement are satisfied;
•
prior to the termination of the merger agreement, an acquisition proposal has been publicly announced or
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and
•
within one year of such termination, Sumo Logic consummates, or enters into a definitive agreement
providing for (and such acquisition proposal is subsequently consummated at any time), a transaction
involving the acquisition of at least 50.1 percent of the outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock or
Sumo Logic’s assets.
Sumo Logic is not required to pay its termination fee on more than one occasion. The merger agreement also provides
that Sumo Logic, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may specifically enforce the
obligations under the merger agreement, except that Sumo Logic may only cause Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the merger, and Parent to cause the equity financing to be funded pursuant to the equity commitment
letter if certain conditions are satisfied. Subject to limited exceptions, Parent’s and Merger Sub’s aggregate liability for
monetary damages for breaches of the merger agreement are capped at $104.0 million, plus certain reimbursement
obligations, and Sumo Logic’s liability for monetary damages for breaches of the merger agreement is capped at $52.0
million, plus any enforcement expenses.

The proposed merger is the acquisition of Sumo Logic by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
is approved by Sumo Logic’s stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are
satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Sumo Logic, with Sumo Logic continuing as the
surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Sumo Logic will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent,
and Sumo Logic common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the Nasdaq. In
addition, Sumo Logic common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file
periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $12.05 in cash (subject to certain exceptions), less
any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Sumo Logic common stock that you own, unless you have
properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the DGCL, and
certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of Sumo Logic
common stock, you will receive $1,205 in cash in exchange for your shares of Sumo Logic common stock, less
any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
How does the per share price compare to the market price of Sumo Logic common stock?
A:
This amount constitutes a premium of approximately 57 percent to Sumo Logic’s unaffected closing stock price
on January 20, 2023, the last full trading day prior to media reports regarding a possible acquisition of Sumo
Logic.
Q:
What will happen to restricted stock, Sumo Logic RSUs, Sumo Logic PSUs, Sumo Logic options, and Sumo
Logic warrants? 
A:
Generally speaking, restricted stock, Sumo Logic RSUs, Sumo Logic PSUs, Sumo Logic options, and Sumo Logic
warrants will be treated at the effective time of the merger as follows:
•
Each share of restricted stock will vest in full and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the per share price less any applicable withholding taxes.
15TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Each vested Sumo Logic RSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject to such
vested Sumo Logic RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.
•
Each unvested Sumo Logic RSU will be cancelled and converted into a converted cash award with respect
to an aggregate amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic
common stock subject to such unvested Sumo Logic RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less
applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted
cash award will continue to be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding unvested Sumo Logic RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
•
Each vested Sumo Logic PSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject to such
vested Sumo Logic PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement),
multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.
•
Each unvested Sumo Logic PSU will be cancelled and converted into a converted cash award with respect
to an aggregate amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic
common stock subject to such unvested Sumo Logic PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of
the applicable award agreement), multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.
Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted cash award will be subject to
the same terms and conditions (excluding performance-based vesting conditions) as applied to the
corresponding unvested Sumo Logic PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
•
Each vested Sumo Logic option will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject to the
vested Sumo Logic option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the exercise price
per share of such vested Sumo Logic option, less applicable withholding taxes.
•
Each unvested Sumo Logic option will be cancelled and converted into a converted cash award with
respect to an aggregate amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo
Logic common stock subject to such unvested Sumo Logic option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of
the per share price over the exercise price per share of such unvested Sumo Logic option, less applicable
withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted cash award
will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding unvested Sumo Logic option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
•
Any underwater Sumo Logic option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no
consideration or payment.
•
Each Sumo Logic warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
deemed exercised in full as a “cashless exercise” (as described in the Sumo Logic warrants) effective upon
the effective time of the merger, in accordance with the terms of the Sumo Logic warrants. The holder of
such Sumo Logic warrant will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (1) the number of shares of
Sumo Logic common stock deemed to be issuable upon exercise in full of such Sumo Logic warrant as a
“cashless exercise,” (calculated in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of such Sumo
Logic warrant) multiplied by (2) the per share price, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
What will happen to the ESPP?
A:
Prior to the effective time of the merger, we have taken, or will take all actions necessary to (1) provide that no
new individuals will be permitted to enroll in the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement; (2) make
any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period,
but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering
period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (3) not allow any increase in the amount of
participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP during the current purchase period from those in effect
on the date of the merger agreement; (4) cause the exercise (as of no later than one business day prior to the
date on which the effective time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP, but otherwise
not issue any of Sumo Logic common stock under the ESPP; (5) provide that no further offering period or
purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP on or after the date of the merger agreement;
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and (6) not extend the current purchase period. Immediately prior to and effective as of the effective time of the
merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), we will terminate the ESPP, and no further rights will be
granted or exercised under the ESPP after such termination.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
A:
You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Sumo Logic and
Sumo Logic will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;
•
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo
Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; and
•
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the
time of the special meeting.
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting will take place on May 10, 2023 at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time. You may attend the special
meeting via a live interactive webcast on the internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SUMO2023SM.
You will be able to listen to the special meeting live and vote online. You will need the control number found on
your proxy card or voting instruction form in order to participate in the special meeting (including voting your
shares).
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
All of Sumo Logic’s stockholders as of the close of business on April 3, 2023, which is the record date for the
special meeting, are entitled to vote their shares of Sumo Logic common stock at the special meeting. As of the
close of business on the record date, there were 124,088,187 shares of Sumo Logic common stock outstanding
and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of Sumo Logic common stock outstanding as of the
record date is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common
stock as of the record date and entitled to vote is required to adopt the merger agreement.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or
by telephone; or (3) attend and vote at the special meeting, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your
bank, broker, or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation
that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to its named executive officers in connection with the merger;
and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting?
A:
Approval of the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Sumo Logic common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Sumo Logic common stock present in person
or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or
by telephone; or (3) vote at the special meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger, or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting, except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining a quorum at
the meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee
how to vote your shares will not have any effect on these proposals, except to the extent that such failure
affects obtaining a quorum at the meeting. In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” these proposals.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement, and the documents that we
refer to or incorporate by reference in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger affects you.
Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, please sign, date, and return, as promptly as possible,
the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card), so that your
shares can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting
instruction form provided by your bank, broker, or other nominee for information on how to vote your shares.
Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you attend the special meeting and vote at
the special meeting, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
Q:
How does the Sumo Logic Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Sumo Logic Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo
Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment
of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not adopted by Sumo Logic’s stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, Sumo Logic’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Sumo Logic common
stock in connection with the merger. Instead: (1) Sumo Logic will remain an independent public company; (2)
Sumo Logic common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the
Exchange Act; and (3) Sumo Logic will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Sumo Logic has agreed to pay Parent
(or its designee) a termination fee.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Termination
Fees and Remedies.”
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to its named executive officers in
connection with the merger?
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain
of Sumo Logic’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and arrangements that are contractual in
nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent or its affiliates (including, following the
consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation) to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection
with or following the merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this
proxy statement captioned “Proposal 2: Approval, on a Non-Binding, Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-Related
Executive Compensation.”
18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo
Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
Sumo Logic is required to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may
become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger is not required to consummate the merger.
Q:
What will happen if Sumo Logic’s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become
payable by Sumo Logic to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger is not a condition to consummation of the merger. This is an
advisory vote and will not be binding on Sumo Logic or Parent. The underlying plans and arrangements
providing for such compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder
approval.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by Sumo Logic’s stockholders and the merger is consummated,
the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger will or may be paid to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers even if Sumo Logic’s
stockholders do not approve such compensation.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Sumo Logic’s transfer agent, American Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” If you
are a stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on
behalf of Sumo Logic. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares at
the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker, or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of Sumo Logic common stock held in “street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Sumo
Logic common stock held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank,
broker, or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker, or other nominee how to vote your shares by
following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you
are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you provide a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special
meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker automatically vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker, or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker, or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker, or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of obtaining a quorum or voted on the proposals,
which will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no
effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger or the proposal
to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Sumo Logic common stock are registered in your
name with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, Sumo Logic’s transfer agent), there are four ways to
vote:
•
by signing, dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your
convenience);
•
by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
by calling the toll-free (within the United States or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the special meeting virtually and voting at the special meeting using the control number on
the enclosed proxy card.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your
shares of Sumo Logic common stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded
when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is no charge for voting your
shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access
and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of Sumo Logic
common stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that
you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Sumo Logic common stock at the special meeting even if
you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your
vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker, or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker, or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker, or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker, or other nominee, electronically
over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker, or other
nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker, or
nominee. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special
meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other nominee giving you the right to
vote your shares at the special meeting.
If you hold your shares of Sumo Logic common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker, or
other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the special meeting if
you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at
the special meeting.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the special meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to Sumo Logic’s Corporate Secretary; or
•
attending the special meeting virtually and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the
enclosed proxy card.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will
vote your shares in the way that you direct.
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the Sumo Logic
Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from
time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal
containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
appropriate cash payment for the shares of Sumo Logic common stock represented by your stock certificates.
Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for
the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
If you hold your shares of Sumo Logic common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of
transmittal. Instead, the payment agent will pay you the appropriate portion of the merger consideration upon
receipt of a customary “agent’s message” and any other items specified by the payment agent.
Q:
What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special
meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective
time of the merger. If you sell or transfer your shares of Sumo Logic common stock after the record date but
before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you
and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies Sumo Logic in writing of such
special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the per share price with
respect to such shares, if the merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but
you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your shares of
Sumo Logic common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date, and return the enclosed proxy
card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card).
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date, and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy
card and voting instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than
one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote all voting materials that you receive.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
If available, Sumo Logic may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. Sumo
Logic intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following
the special meeting. All reports that Sumo Logic files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the
merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. holder, the exchange of Sumo Logic common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. holder to recognize
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received by such U.S. holder in the merger and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
shares of Sumo Logic common stock surrendered in the merger.
A Non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with
respect to the exchange of Sumo Logic common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. holder has
certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S.
holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup
withholding tax.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor to determine the
U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances and
21
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S.
taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and does not constitute legal advice
to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is
provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the merger in the second calendar quarter of 2023. However, the exact timing of
completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions
specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of Sumo Logic’s control.
Q:
What governmental and regulatory approvals are required?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period (and
extensions thereof, if any) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, and no
agreement with any governmental authority not to consummate the merger shall be in effect. In addition, the
merger cannot be completed until all consents of the relevant governmental authorities under the specified
foreign direct investment laws have been obtained or any applicable waiting period thereunder (including any
extensions thereof) has expired or been terminated.
Sumo Logic and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with
the FTC and the DOJ on February 23, 2023. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59
p.m., Eastern time on March 27, 2023.
In addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with Sumo Logic, submitted the specified foreign direct
investment filings on or prior to March 1, 2023.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the merger is consummated, Sumo Logic’s stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of capital
stock) who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their shares
of Sumo Logic’s common stock through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their
shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement; and
(5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of
their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL if certain conditions set forth in
Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. This means that these persons will be entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with
(unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest
on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the
merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount
rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of
the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the
entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person
seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y)
interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make
such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons who wish to seek appraisal of their
shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to
the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in
additional detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights, available at the following URL, accessible without subscription or cost, which is
incorporated herein by reference: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.
Q:
Do any of Sumo Logic’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Sumo
Logic stockholders generally? 
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Sumo Logic Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, you should be aware that Sumo Logic’s directors and executive officers may have interests
22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Sumo Logic’s stockholders generally. In:
(1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement; and (3) unanimously
recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Sumo Logic’s stockholders, the Sumo Logic Board was
aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Q:

merger, including in circumstances requiring Sumo Logic to pay a termination fee;
•
uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of the merger and the ability of each party to
consummate the merger;
•
the nature, cost, and outcome of any legal proceeding that may be instituted against us and others relating
to the merger;
•
economic, market, business, or geopolitical conditions (including resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,
inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, or the military conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions
against Russia and Belarus) or competition, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting Sumo
Logic’s business, operations, and financial performance;

customers, operating results, and business generally, including risks related to the diversion of the
attention of Sumo Logic management or employees during the pendency of the merger;

acquisition proposals during the pendency of the merger;
•
the fact that, if the merger is completed, Sumo Logic’s stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the
potential long-term value of the successful execution of Sumo Logic’s current strategy as an independent
company;
•
possible disruption related to the merger to Sumo Logic’s current plans and operations, including through
the loss of customers and employees; and

Only Sumo Logic’s stockholders as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote
at, the special meeting. A list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for
inspection by stockholders for any purpose germane to the special meeting at Sumo Logic’s corporate offices located
at 855 Main Street, Suite 100, Redwood City, California 94063, during regular business hours for a period of ten days
ending on the day before the date of the special meeting. You will need the control number included on your proxy
card or otherwise provided by your bank, broker, or other nominee to access the stockholder list during the special
meeting.
As of the record date, there were 124,088,187 shares of Sumo Logic common stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of Sumo Logic common stock issued and outstanding as of the
close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly submitted for a vote at
the special meeting.
The holders of a majority of the voting power of the capital stock of Sumo Logic issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum.",36,36

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the issued and outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock as of the record date and entitled to vote on the
proposal. Adoption of the merger agreement by Sumo Logic’s stockholders is a condition to the closing of the
merger.
26TABLE OF CONTENTS
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to
Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
voting power of the shares of Sumo Logic common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the voting power of the shares of Sumo Logic common stock present in person or represented by proxy at
the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted: (1)
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to
a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker, or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not
vote on a proposal because the bank, broker, or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks
discretionary power to vote your shares. We do not expect any “broker non-votes” at the special meeting, but if there
are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If there are broker non-
votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will
have no effect on: (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (2) the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.

owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,144,466 shares of Sumo Logic common stock, representing
approximately 2.5 percent of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock as of the
record date.
As of the date of this proxy statement, Sumo Logic has not been informed that any of Sumo Logic’s directors intend

connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or

Company, LLC, you may vote your shares by returning a signed and dated proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is
provided for your convenience), or you may vote at the special meeting using the control number located on the
enclosed proxy card. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone by
following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the
instructions on the proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone.
If you attend the special meeting and wish to vote at the special meeting, you will need the control number located on
the enclosed proxy card. Beneficial owners of shares held in “street name” must also provide a “legal proxy” from
their bank or broker in order to vote at the special meeting. You are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to
attend the special meeting. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will revoke
any previously submitted proxy.
All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies (or proxies granted electronically over the internet or by
telephone) will, if received before the special meeting, be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the
27TABLE OF CONTENTS
instructions of the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies (or proxies granted electronically over the internet
or by telephone) that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” adoption of the merger agreement;
(2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a
later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker, or other nominee, you may vote through your bank,
broker, or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker, or
other nominee. You may also attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting if you have a “legal proxy”
from your bank, broker, or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting. If available
from your bank, broker, or other nominee, you may vote over the internet or telephone through your bank, broker, or
other nominee by following the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker, or other
nominee. If you do not (1) return your bank’s, broker’s, or other nominee’s voting instruction form; (2) vote over the
internet or by telephone through your bank, broker, or other nominee; or (3) attend the special meeting and vote at
the special meeting with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you
voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. It will not, however, have any effect on the
proposals (A) to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by
Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (B) to adjourn the special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting.",37,38

If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the special meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to Sumo Logic’s Corporate Secretary; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed
proxy card.
If you have submitted a proxy, your attendance at the special meeting, in the absence of voting at the special meeting
or submitting an additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.
If you hold your shares of Sumo Logic common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker, or other nominee, you
should contact your bank, broker, or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may
also vote at the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other nominee giving you the
right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Any adjournment, postponement, or other delay of the special meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies, will allow Sumo Logic’s stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any
time prior to their use at the special meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

determined that the merger agreement, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Sumo Logic and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and

In addition to the proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; and (2) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis,
the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger, Sumo Logic’s stockholders are also being asked to approve any proposal to adjourn the
special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional votes or proxies in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
approve the merger agreement. If a quorum is not present, the chairperson of the special meeting or the stockholders
entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting,
from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented.
The chairperson may also adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date or time, even if a quorum is present. In
addition, the special meeting could be postponed before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement.
If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, Sumo Logic’s stockholders who have already submitted their
proxies will be able to revoke them at any time before they are voted at the special meeting.",39,39

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by Sumo Logic. We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a
professional proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies, and provide related advice and
informational support during the solicitation process, for a fee of up to $40,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. We will indemnify this firm against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on Sumo Logic’s
behalf. In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers, and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares of
Sumo Logic’s common stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies
may also be solicited by Sumo Logic’s directors, officers, and employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax or
over the internet. No additional compensation will be paid for such services.

We currently expect to complete the merger in the second calendar quarter of 2023. However, the exact timing of
completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions
specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of Sumo Logic’s control.
Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated, Sumo Logic’s stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of capital stock)
who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold their shares through the
effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and
statutory requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose
their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section
262 of the DGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. This means that such
persons will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in
cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Sumo Logic common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a
rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective time of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded
quarterly (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes
a voluntary cash payment to each person seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x)
the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery; and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under
no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, persons who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
29TABLE OF CONTENTS
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would
receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record or a beneficial owner must (1) submit a written demand for
appraisal to Sumo Logic before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in
person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold of record or own
beneficially the subject shares of Sumo Logic common stock through the effective time of the merger; and (4) strictly
comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the
procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Sumo Logic unless certain conditions are satisfied by the
persons seeking appraisal. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are
described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the
DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. You may find an electronic copy of Section 262 of
the DGCL available at the following URL, accessible without subscription or cost, which is incorporated herein by

engaging in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Merger Sub has not engaged in any business
activities other than as incidental to its formation and in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and arranging of the equity financing and any debt financing in connection with the merger. Upon
completion of the merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and Sumo Logic will continue as the surviving corporation.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
effective time of the merger, (1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Sumo Logic; (2) the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub will cease; and (3) Sumo Logic will continue as the surviving corporation of the merger and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.
As a result of the merger, Sumo Logic will cease to be a publicly traded company, Sumo Logic common stock will be
delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act and Sumo Logic will no longer file periodic
reports with the SEC. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the surviving
corporation.
The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that
certificate by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as we, Parent and Merger Sub may
agree and specify in such certificate of merger).",42,42

connection with the merger. Instead, (1) Sumo Logic will remain an independent public company; (2) Sumo Logic
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we
will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that: (A)
Sumo Logic’s management will continue to operate the business as it is currently being operated; and (B) Sumo
Logic’s stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently
subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Sumo Logic operates and adverse
economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the merger not to be
completed, there can be no assurance as to the price at which Sumo Logic common stock may trade, and the price of
Sumo Logic common stock could decline significantly.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the effect of the merger not being completed on the future value of your
shares of Sumo Logic common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Sumo Logic Board will continue to evaluate
and review, among other things, Sumo Logic’s business, operations, strategic direction, and capitalization, and will
make whatever changes it deems appropriate. If the merger agreement is not adopted by Sumo Logic’s stockholders
or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Sumo Logic’s business, prospects or results of operation may
be adversely impacted.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Sumo Logic has agreed to pay Parent (or its
designee) the applicable termination fee.",42,43

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger:
•
each outstanding share of Sumo Logic common stock that is (1) held by Sumo Logic as treasury stock; (2)
owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement.
This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Sumo Logic Board, its
committees, its representatives or other parties.
The Sumo Logic Board regularly evaluates Sumo Logic’s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view
toward strengthening Sumo Logic’s business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Sumo
Logic Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included, among others,
(1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, Sumo Logic’s current business plan, with Sumo Logic
remaining an independent entity; (2) potential expansion opportunities through acquisitions, partnerships or other
commercial relationships; (3) various capital raising alternatives; and (4) other financial and strategic alternatives,
including the sale of Sumo Logic.
In September 2020, Sumo Logic completed its initial public offering at a price of $22.00 per share of Sumo Logic
common stock. Following its initial public offering, Sumo Logic experienced a variety of challenges to executing on its
strategic plan, which challenges continued into the second half of 2022. These challenges contributed to volatility in
the trading price of Sumo Logic common stock. By early June 2022, Sumo Logic common stock had declined to
approximately $8.00 per share from a high of approximately $40.00 per share in February 2021. In addition, by June
2022, the Sumo Logic Board had heard from several Sumo Logic stockholders regarding their concerns with Sumo
Logic’s stock price, growth, path to profitability and strategy.
On June 3, 2022, representatives of Francisco Partners contacted Charles Robel, Sumo Logic’s lead independent
director, to request a meeting. The representatives of Francisco Partners did not specify the subject matter for the
requested meeting.
On June 6, 2022, and prior to any meeting with Mr. Robel, representatives of Francisco Partners informed Mr. Robel
that Francisco Partners would be submitting a proposal to acquire Sumo Logic. Later that day, Francisco Partners
provided Sumo Logic with a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo Logic for $11.00 in cash per share of Sumo Logic
common stock (which proposal is referred to as the “June proposal”).
On June 8, 2022, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, Sumo Logic’s outside legal advisor (which is referred to as
“Wilson Sonsini”), in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Sumo
Logic Board their fiduciary duties. Ramin Sayar, Sumo Logic’s president and chief executive officer, reviewed the June
proposal. The Sumo Logic Board determined that the June proposal was credible and merited further consideration
and, for convenience and efficiency, delegated authority to its Audit Committee to work with Wilson Sonsini and
Sumo Logic’s other advisors, as well as Sumo Logic management, to further analyze the June proposal.
Following this meeting, the Audit Committee and the Sumo Logic Board each met on multiple occasions to evaluate
the June proposal with the assistance of Wilson Sonsini and an investment bank (which, for purposes of clarity, was
not Morgan Stanley). At the conclusion of this process, the Sumo Logic Board determined that the June proposal
was not at a compelling valuation. The Sumo Logic Board also noted its belief in the strength of Sumo Logic’s
prospects as an independent public company and expectation that investors would react positively to Sumo Logic’s
(1) financial results for the remainder of its 2023 fiscal year; and (2) upcoming investor day, during which Sumo Logic
management would provide additional details on the company’s business and financial plan, path to profitability and
strategic vision.
On July 12, 2022, Mr. Robel met with representatives of Francisco Partners. The representatives of Francisco Partners
requested an introductory meeting with Sumo Logic management. Mr. Robel stated that a meeting with Sumo Logic
management was not warranted at that time. In addition, Mr. Robel informed Francisco Partners that the June
proposal was not at a compelling valuation and that the Sumo Logic Board believed in the strength of Sumo Logic’s
prospects as an independent public company.
On August 25, 2022, Sumo Logic announced earnings for the second quarter of its 2023 fiscal year. Sumo Logic
exceeded the guidance that it had provided to the investment community with respect to Sumo Logic’s total revenue,
non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net loss per share for that quarter.
34TABLE OF CONTENTS
On September 20, 2022, Sumo Logic held its investor day, during which Sumo Logic management explained Sumo
Logic’s business and financial plan, path to profitability and strategic vision.
By early October 2022, Sumo Logic common stock was trading at prices similar to that in June 2022.
On October 3, 2022, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of
Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Sumo Logic Board discussed investors’ feedback to the investor day. In an effort
to ensure that Sumo Logic was appropriately prepared should any third party (including Francisco Partners) submit
an acquisition proposal, the Sumo Logic Board determined to explore the possible retention of an investment bank to
provide financial advice and perspective. The Sumo Logic Board also instructed Messrs. Robel and Sayar to meet
with representatives of Francisco Partners to better understand the current state of Francisco Partners' objectives
with respect to Sumo Logic.
In the days following the October 3, 2022, meeting of the Sumo Logic Board, Mr. Robel and Randy Gottfried, an
independent Sumo Logic director and chair of the Audit Committee, contacted Morgan Stanley and another
investment bank to assess their respective qualifications, independence and availability to assist Sumo Logic.
Following discussions with these two investment banks, Mr. Robel and Mr. Gottfried determined to recommend that
the Sumo Logic Board engage Morgan Stanley to provide assistance to Sumo Logic due to Morgan Stanley’s
knowledge of Sumo Logic from its role as an underwriter in Sumo Logic’s initial public offering, as well as its
qualifications, knowledge of the industry in which Sumo Logic operates and experience in advising similar companies
in connection with potential strategic transactions. The other investment bank declined to explore an engagement by
Sumo Logic due to its existing workload and inability to dedicate the appropriate resources to an engagement.
On October 10, 2022, Messrs. Robel and Sayar met with representatives of Francisco Partners. During the meeting,
the representatives of Francisco Partners expressed their continued interest in acquiring Sumo Logic. Following the
meeting, Mr. Robel updated the Sumo Logic Board on the discussion.
On October 14, 2022, representatives of a potential financial sponsor acquiror (which we refer to as “Sponsor A”)
contacted Stewart Grierson, Sumo Logic’s chief financial officer. The representatives of Sponsor A expressed
Sponsor A’s admiration for Sumo Logic and stated that Sponsor A had accumulated a position in Sumo Logic
common stock through open market purchases. The representatives of Sponsor A also expressed Sponsor A’s
interest in being included in any strategic review process that was undertaken by the Sumo Logic Board. At no point
during the conversation did Sponsor A make a proposal to acquire Sumo Logic. In the light of Sponsor A’s status as
a stockholder of Sumo Logic, the parties agreed to meet following Sumo Logic’s earnings release for the third quarter
of its 2023 fiscal year; Sumo Logic regularly meets with investors in the ordinary course following earnings
announcements. Promptly following the meeting, Mr. Grierson updated members of the Sumo Logic Board on the
discussion.
On November 2, 2022, Francisco Partners provided Sumo Logic with a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo Logic
for $11.50 in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock (which proposal is referred to as the “November proposal”).
Shortly thereafter, representatives of Francisco Partners contacted Mr. Robel to request a meeting to discuss the
November proposal.
On November 4, 2022, Mr. Robel met with representatives of a potential financial sponsor acquiror (which we refer to
as “Sponsor B”) at Sponsor B’s request. Sponsor B was introduced to Mr. Robel by a Sumo Logic stockholder.
During this meeting, the participants discussed, in general terms, Sponsor B’s business and strategy. A potential
acquisition of Sumo Logic by Sponsor B was not discussed.
Also on November 4, 2022, the Sumo Logic Board met, with representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The
representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Sumo Logic Board their fiduciary duties. The
Sumo Logic Board discussed the November proposal and Mr. Robel’s meeting with Sponsor B. The Sumo Logic
Board determined that (1) the November proposal was credible and had the potential to lead to a transaction that
would be attractive to Sumo Logic and its stockholders; and (2) it might be appropriate to commence, in the near
future, a review of Sumo Logic’s strategic alternatives. In view of the potentially significant workload that could be
involved in a review of strategic alternatives, the possibility that Sumo Logic management might need feedback and
direction on relatively short notice, and the benefits, convenience and efficiency of having a subset of directors
oversee any process of considering strategic alternatives, the Sumo Logic Board delegated authority to its Corporate
Governance and Nominating Committee (which we refer to as the “Corporate Governance Committee”) to,
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
among other things, (1) oversee and assist Sumo Logic management and Sumo Logic’s advisors and consultants with
respect to the exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives; (2) explore, evaluate, consider, review and
negotiate the terms and conditions of any transaction relating to any strategic alternative; and (3) if appropriate,
recommend to the Sumo Logic Board what action, if any, should be taken by Sumo Logic with respect to any strategic
alternative. The delegation of authority to the Corporate Governance Committee was for convenience and efficiency,
and not to address any potential conflicts of interest. The Sumo Logic Board retained the exclusive power and
authority to approve the entry into a definitive agreement relating to any strategic alternative, including a sale of
Sumo Logic. It was also understood that the Sumo Logic Board would continue to have an active role in the
consideration of strategic alternatives, and that the Corporate Governance Committee would update and seek input
from the Sumo Logic Board as appropriate. The Sumo Logic Board did not provide for the payment of any additional
compensation to the members of the Corporate Governance Committee in consideration of the expanded role of the
committee (other than their ordinary course compensation as members of the Sumo Logic Board and such committee).
The Sumo Logic Board also considered Morgan Stanley’s qualifications and independence and discussed engaging
Morgan Stanley as Sumo Logic’s financial advisor. Morgan Stanley is well known to the Sumo Logic Board given
Morgan Stanley’s role as an underwriter in Sumo Logic’s initial public offering, as well as Morgan Stanley’s
qualifications, extensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which Sumo Logic operates
and experience in advising similar companies in connection with potential strategic transactions. The Sumo Logic
Board approved the engagement of Morgan Stanley as Sumo Logic’s financial advisor and instructed Mr. Gottfried to
work with the Corporate Governance Committee to negotiate and enter into an appropriate engagement letter with
Morgan Stanley. Following this meeting, Mr. Gottfried, together with the Corporate Governance Committee,
negotiated the terms of an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley.
On November 8, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with representatives of Wilson Sonsini in
attendance. It was the practice of the Corporate Governance Committee, at this and subsequent meetings, to invite
Mr. Gottfried to attend the committee’s meetings in order to have the benefit of his perspective and expertise. The
Corporate Governance Committee also had a practice of meeting in executive session without Sumo Logic
management or representatives of Morgan Stanley during its meetings. The Corporate Governance Committee
discussed the November proposal and various responses to this proposal, along with the terms of the engagement
letter with Morgan Stanley.
On November 15, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
described the broad contours of a strategic review process that could be undertaken by Sumo Logic. The Corporate
Governance Committee discussed the potential scope of such a strategic review process, including a preliminary list
of counterparties that might have an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic, and the ability to finance and
consummate an acquisition. Also considered were potential risks of a strategic review process, including potential
public disclosures, management and employee disruption and distraction, and impacts on Sumo Logic’s business,
and the increase in the likelihood of those risks if a wider private or public process was used relative to a process that
was more targeted. In consideration of these risks, it was the consensus of the Corporate Governance Committee that
Sumo Logic should pursue a targeted, private process focused on the potential strategic and financial acquirers most
likely to have an interest in acquiring Sumo Logic and the capability to finance and consummate such an acquisition.
The Corporate Governance Committee agreed that, as a first step in that process, representatives of Sumo Logic
should meet with representatives of Francisco Partners to discuss the November proposal. In the days after this
meeting, the Corporate Governance Committee reviewed and approved the final terms of an engagement letter with
Morgan Stanley.
On November 16, 2022, Messrs. Gottfried, Grierson, Robel and Sayar met, at the direction of the Corporate
Governance Committee, with representatives of Francisco Partners to discuss the November proposal.
On November 21, 2022, Sumo Logic entered into an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley.
On November 22, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The Corporate Governance Committee
discussed the November proposal and the contours of a strategic review process that could be undertaken by Sumo
Logic, including a preliminary list of counterparties that might have an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo
Logic.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 29, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. Discussion continued regarding the
contours of a strategic review process that could be undertaken by Sumo Logic, including a preliminary list of
counterparties that might have an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic. The representatives of Morgan
Stanley reviewed with the Corporate Governance Committee the terms of the November proposal from a financial
point of view.
On December 1, 2022, representatives of a potential financial sponsor acquiror (which we refer to as “Sponsor C”), on
an unsolicited basis, contacted Morgan Stanley and stated that Sponsor C would potentially be interested in
pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic. Sponsor C did not make a proposal to acquire Sumo Logic. The
representatives of Morgan Stanley reported this outreach by Sponsor C to the Corporate Governance Committee.
On December 7, 2022, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of
each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley provided their
perspective on market conditions and mergers and acquisitions activity in the software and broader technology
space. They also described the broad contours of a strategic review process that could be undertaken by Sumo
Logic, including a preliminary list of counterparties that might have an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo
Logic. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the Corporate Governance Committee’s determination to
pursue a targeted, private strategic review process. As part of this discussion, the Sumo Logic Board noted the
potential negative impacts on Sumo Logic of such a process, including the impact on customers and employees of
any rumors that Sumo Logic was pursuing a sale. The Sumo Logic Board discussed potential alternatives to a sale of
Sumo Logic, including continuing as an independent public company. It was the consensus of the Sumo Logic Board
that Morgan Stanley should commence a process to contact 14 potential acquirers, composed of four potential
strategic acquirors and ten potential financial sponsor acquirors (including Francisco Partners) to better understand
their respective interest in acquiring Sumo Logic. The 14 potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors were
selected by the Sumo Logic Board following discussions with Morgan Stanley and Sumo Logic management and
taking into account the expected relative interest of each potential acquiror in an acquisition of Sumo Logic and each
potential acquiror’s ability to finance and consummate an acquisition. The Sumo Logic Board concluded that Morgan
Stanley should inform Francisco Partners that the November proposal was not compelling but Francisco Partners was
welcome to participate in the strategic review process. The Sumo Logic Board discussed the conversations held to
date with Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C and determined not to include Sponsor A, Sponsor B or Sponsor C
in the initial phase of the strategic review process out of a belief that they were unlikely to have the capability to
finance and consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic.
In the days following the December 7, 2022, meeting of the Sumo Logic Board, Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the
Sumo Logic Board, (1) informed Francisco Partners that the November proposal was not compelling and invited
Francisco Partners to conduct additional due diligence to increase its proposal and (2) contacted the other 13
potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors selected by the Sumo Logic Board to gauge their interest in an
acquisition of Sumo Logic. Nine of the potential financial sponsor acquirors (including Francisco Partners) and two
potential strategic acquirors (which we refer to as “Strategic 1” and “Strategic 2”), ultimately entered into
confidentiality agreements with Sumo Logic. Certain of these confidentiality agreements included a customary
“standstill” restriction on the counterparty’s ability to make public proposals to acquire Sumo Logic, but (1) all such
standstill restrictions terminated upon the announcement of the signing of the merger agreement; and (2) none of the
confidentiality agreements included restrictions on any counterparty’s ability to make private proposals to acquire
Sumo Logic.
On December 5, 2022, Sumo Logic announced earnings for the third quarter of its 2023 fiscal year.
On December 9, 2022, Sumo Logic management met with representatives of Sponsor A, as agreed in the parties’
October 2022 meeting. During the meeting, the representatives of Sponsor A spoke generally about the possible
benefits to Sumo Logic of not being a public company and Sponsor A’s willingness to partner with Sumo Logic if it
chose to become a private company. Sponsor A did not make an offer to acquire Sumo Logic during this meeting.
On December 13, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The members of Sumo Logic management
described their (1) recent meeting with representatives of Sponsor A; and (2) current expectations for Sumo Logic’s
operating and financial results for fiscal years 2024 through 2026.
From December 14, 2022 through January 5, 2023, Sumo Logic management, with representatives of Morgan Stanley
in attendance, gave management presentations concerning Sumo Logic’s business to the nine financial sponsor
acquirors (including Francisco Partners) that had entered into confidentially agreements with Sumo Logic. After
undertaking due diligence following these meetings, two of the nine financial sponsor acquirors declined to proceed
with further discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Sumo Logic due to other investment priorities and
generalized concerns regarding Sumo Logic’s business. During this period, Francisco Partners and the six other
financial sponsor acquirors considering an acquisition of Sumo Logic (which we refer to as “Sponsor D,” “Sponsor
E,” “Sponsor F,” “Sponsor G,” “Sponsor H” and “Sponsor I,” respectively) were granted access to an electronic
dataroom containing financial and business information with respect to Sumo Logic to support their due diligence
review of Sumo Logic. Each of Strategic 1 and Strategic 2 had the opportunity to participate in management
presentations during this period, but, given the other priorities of Strategic 1 and Strategic 2, neither received a
management presentation until the week of January 16, 2023.
On December 20, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the
relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The Corporate Governance Committee approved a
request from Sponsor G to partner with another financial sponsor acquiror concerning a possible joint bid to acquire
Sumo Logic. The Corporate Governance Committee discussed whether to include Sponsor A, Sponsor B or Sponsor
C in the current phase of Sumo Logic’s strategic review process. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance
Committee (1) to pursue discussions with Sponsor A given Sponsor A’s stated interest in participating in a strategic
review process that Sumo Logic might choose to undertake; (2) not to pursue discussions with Sponsor B given that
(a) Sponsor B had not expressed an interest in acquiring Sumo Logic; and (b) Sponsor B was unlikely to be able to
finance and consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic; and (3) not to pursue discussions with Sponsor C given that
Sponsor C was unlikely to be able to finance and consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic. The Corporate
Governance Committee discussed the possibility of contacting additional potential strategic or financial sponsor
acquirors beyond Sponsor A, Sponsor B, Sponsor C and the 14 other potential strategic and financial sponsor
acquirors (including Francisco Partners) that had already been contacted. It was the consensus of the Corporate
Governance Committee not to contact additional potential acquirors at that time given the robust interest in an
acquisition already being displayed and the desire for a targeted, private strategic review process that minimized the
potential for rumors that Sumo Logic was conducting a review of strategic alternatives, which would be disruptive to
Sumo Logic’s business.
On December 21, 2022, a representative of Sponsor A contacted Mr. Sayar to request a meeting with Sumo Logic
management. Later that day, and consistent with the decision of the Corporate Governance Committee,
representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted Sponsor A to invite Sponsor A to participate in the strategic review
process. Sponsor A responded that it would need additional time to consider whether to participate.
On December 27, 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The members of Sumo Logic
management reviewed with the Corporate Governance Committee a draft, prepared by Sumo Logic management, of
Sumo Logic’s preliminary long-range operating plan. The members of Sumo Logic management described the process
for preparing the long-range operating plan, along with the underlying assumptions and various execution and other
risks to realizing the forecasted results. The Corporate Governance Committee provided advice and input to Sumo
Logic management on the preliminary long-range operating plan. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance
Committee that the preliminary long-range operating plan was not yet developed sufficiently to recommend to the
Sumo Logic Board, and, accordingly, the Corporate Governance Committee directed Sumo Logic management to
refine the plan based on the input provided by the Corporate Governance Committee.
On January 3, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The members of Sumo Logic management reviewed with the
Corporate Governance Committee a revised draft of Sumo Logic’s preliminary long-range operating plan, which
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reflected the input received from the Corporate Governance Committee at its meeting on December 27, 2022. It was the
consensus of the Corporate Governance Committee to share the revised preliminary long-range operating plan with
the Sumo Logic Board for additional input and perspectives.
On January 6, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of
Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The members of Sumo Logic management reviewed with the Sumo Logic Board a draft
of Sumo Logic’s preliminary long-range operating plan. The process for preparing the preliminary long-range
operating plan was described, along with the underlying assumptions and various execution and other risks to
realizing the forecasted results. The Sumo Logic Board provided advice and input to Sumo Logic management on the
preliminary long-range operating plan and directed Sumo Logic management to refine the preliminary long-range
operating plan based on the input provided by the Sumo Logic Board.
On January 10, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the
relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The Corporate Governance Committee noted the
significant demands on Sumo Logic management and associated distraction as a result of the strategic review
process. The Corporate Governance Committee approved the distribution by Morgan Stanley of a bid process letter
to those potential acquirors that were still considering an acquisition of Sumo Logic, which letter would request
written acquisition proposals be submitted by January 24, 2023.
On January 13, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of
each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The members of Sumo Logic management reviewed a
revised draft of Sumo Logic’s long-range operating plan, which reflected the input received from the Sumo Logic
Board at its meeting on January 6, 2023 (which long-range operating plan is referred to as the “January 2023 long-
range plan”). Additional information about the January 2023 long-range plan is contained in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “-Projections.” The Sumo Logic Board approved providing the January 2023 long-range plan to
(1) Morgan Stanley for purposes of its financial analyses of Sumo Logic; and (2) potential acquirors. A subset of the
January 2023 long-range plan were subsequently provided to each of Francisco Partners, Sponsor D, Sponsor E,
Sponsor F, Sponsor G and its partner (together, the “Sponsor G Consortium”), Sponsor H and Sponsor I.
On January 16, 2023, representatives of a potential financing source (which we refer to as “Financial A”) contacted
Morgan Stanley concerning Financial A’s interest in making a minority investment in Sumo Logic. The
representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that they would inform the Sumo Logic Board of the conversation.
On January 17, 2023, consistent with the direction of the Corporate Governance Committee, Morgan Stanley
distributed bid process letters to Francisco Partners, Sponsor D, Sponsor E, the Sponsor G Consortium, Sponsor H
and Sponsor I; these were the potential acquirors that were still actively considering an acquisition. The bid process
letters requested written acquisition proposals no later than January 24, 2023. Following distribution of the bid
process letters and until January 24, 2023, representatives of Morgan Stanley had multiple discussions with such
parties to encourage them to submit an acquisition proposal.
On January 17, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the
relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The representatives of Morgan Stanley described
their conversation with Financial A. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance Committee that, given the
strategic efforts then underway, the time was not right to pursue discussions with Financial A.
Later on January 17, 2023, Sumo Logic management, with representatives of Morgan Stanley in attendance, gave a
management presentation concerning Sumo Logic’s business to Strategic 2.
Still later on January 17, 2023, representatives of Sponsor A contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley and
expressed Sponsor A’s interest in acquiring Sumo Logic. Sponsor A noted that it could only provide up to $300
million of committed equity financing and would require additional co-investors to finance and consummate an
acquisition of Sumo Logic.
On January 18, 2023, representatives of a potential strategic acquiror (which we refer to as “Strategic 3”), on an
unsolicited basis, contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley concerning Strategic 3’s interest in pursuing an
acquisition of Sumo Logic. The representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that they would inform the Sumo Logic
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board of the conversation. On the same day, representatives of Morgan Stanley, with the authority of the Corporate
Governance Committee, spoke with representatives of Sponsor B regarding Sponsor B’s interest in pursuing an
acquisition of Sumo Logic and to better understand Sponsor B’s ability to finance and consummate a transaction.
Later on January 18, 2023, Sponsor F informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Sponsor F was no longer
pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic given other investment priorities and certain concerns regarding Sumo
Logic’s business.
Still later on January 18, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the
relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The representatives of Morgan Stanley also
described their conversation with Strategic 3. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Sumo Logic
Board preliminary financial analyses of Sumo Logic based on the January 2023 long-range plan.
On January 20, 2023, Sumo Logic management, with representatives of Morgan Stanley in attendance, gave a
management presentation concerning Sumo Logic’s business to Strategic 1.
On January 23, 2023, The Information published an article stating that private equity firms, including Francisco
Partners, had approached Sumo Logic regarding a possible acquisition. The price per share of Sumo Logic common
stock as of the close of trading on January 20, 2023, the last trading day prior to such speculation, was $7.67.
On January 23, 2023, each of Sponsor E and Sponsor I independently informed representatives of Morgan Stanley
that Sponsor E and Sponsor I, respectively, were no longer pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic. Among the
reasons cited by these potential acquirors for choosing not to submit an acquisition proposal were concerns
regarding competition facing Sumo Logic’s business, their assessment of Sumo Logic’s potential cross-sell
opportunity between their respective portfolio companies, cost structure concerns, and additional work necessary to
understand Sumo Logic’s go-to-market strategy. In addition, the Sponsor G Consortium and Sponsor H, separately
and independently, each informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it did not intend to submit a formal
proposal to acquire Sumo Logic but remained interested in pursuing an acquisition at a price of approximately $10.00
in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock.
On January 24, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini
discussed with the members of the Corporate Governance Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed the feedback from those parties that had declined to submit an acquisition proposal. The
Corporate Governance Committee discussed (1) the timing for the receipt of acquisition proposals from Francisco
Partners and Sponsor D, which were expected within the next day; and (2) the additional due diligence required by
each of Strategic 1 and Strategic 2 for either party to submit an acquisition proposal. It was noted that Strategic 1 was
seeking highly confidential and competitively sensitive due diligence information regarding Sumo Logic. The
Corporate Governance Committee discussed the status of Sponsor A and the possibility of contacting Strategic 3
regarding its interest in considering an acquisition of Sumo Logic but did not make any decisions in this regard.
Later on January 24, 2023, representatives of two potential financial sponsor acquirors (which we refer to as “Sponsor
J” and “Sponsor K”) independently contacted Mr. Sayar regarding their interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo
Logic. Mr. Sayar responded that he would inform the Sumo Logic Board of the conversation.
Still later on January 24, 2023, Francisco Partners submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo Logic for $11.95
in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock (which is referred to as the “January proposal”). The January
proposal (1) contemplated that investment funds managed by Francisco Partners would be responsible for the entire
purchase price in the acquisition; and (2) expressed a willingness to sign and announce a transaction within a week.
On January 25, 2023, Strategic 2 informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it was no longer pursuing an
acquisition of Sumo Logic given other investment priorities and concerns regarding Sumo Logic’s business.
Also on January 25, 2023, representatives of a potential financial sponsor acquiror (which we refer to as “Sponsor L”)
contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley regarding Sponsor L’s interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo
Logic. The representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that they would inform the Sumo Logic Board of the
conversation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on January 25, 2023, Sponsor D submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo Logic for $10.50 in cash per
share of Sumo Logic common stock (which proposal is referred to as the “Sponsor D proposal”). The Sponsor D
proposal contemplated that (1) the definitive agreement would not be subject to any financing contingency; and (2)
the parties sign and announce a transaction in early March 2023.
On January 26, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini
discussed with the members of the Corporate Governance Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of
Morgan Stanley provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor
acquirors and the relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. It was noted that Strategic 1
continued to seek highly confidential and competitively sensitive due diligence information. The representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of the January proposal and the Sponsor D proposal from a financial point of
view. The Corporate Governance Committee discussed the current status of the strategic review process. The
Corporate Governance Committee also discussed Sumo Logic’s prospects as an independent public company. The
Corporate Governance Committee determined to recommend to the Sumo Logic Board that (1) Morgan Stanley
request that each of Francisco Partners and Sponsor D submit revised proposals to acquire Sumo Logic no later than
February 3, 2023; (2) Morgan Stanley inform Francisco Partners that the Sumo Logic Board was seeking a purchase
price per share in the teens, or as close to that as possible; and (3) Sumo Logic provide Strategic 1 with a targeted
subset of its requested due diligence information in the hopes of positioning Strategic 1 to make an acquisition
proposal. Discussion ensued as to whether to pursue discussions with any of the parties that had made unsolicited
requests to engage in acquisition discussions with Sumo Logic. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance
Committee that, given their respective abilities to consummate a transaction as well as the advanced nature of the
strategic review process, Morgan Stanley should contact each of Sponsor J, Sponsor K, Sponsor L and Strategic 3 to
better understand each party’s interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic on an accelerated timeline. The
Corporate Governance Committee determined not to engage further with Sponsor A, Sponsor B or Sponsor C at that
time given the number of other potential acquirors already in the process, the robustness of the interest displayed by
those potential acquirors, and the belief of the Corporate Governance Committee that none of Sponsor A, Sponsor B
or Sponsor C was likely to have the capability to finance and consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic.
Later on January 26, 2023, representatives of a potential strategic acquiror (which we refer to as “Strategic 4”)
contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley concerning Strategic 4’s interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo
Logic. The representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that they would inform the Sumo Logic Board of the
conversation.
On January 27, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of
each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an
update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors and the relative level of
acquisition interest that each was then displaying. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the terms of the
January proposal and the Sponsor D proposal from a financial point of view. The members of the Corporate
Governance Committee provided their recommendation on next steps to the Sumo Logic Board. The Sumo Logic
Board reviewed the results of the strategic review process, and, in the light of that process nearing a conclusion,
discussed whether outreach to additional potential strategic or financial sponsor acquirors was warranted. After
discussion, the Sumo Logic Board agreed with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Committee.
However, after considering the remaining parties still engaged in discussions with Sumo Logic, the Sumo Logic Board
authorized Morgan Stanley to contact (1) each of Sponsor A and Strategic 4 regarding their interest in pursuing an
acquisition of Sumo Logic on an accelerated basis; and (2) two additional potential strategic acquirors (which are
referred to as “Strategic 5” and “Strategic 6”) regarding their interest in pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic.
Strategic 5 and Strategic 6 had been identified by Morgan Stanley as parties that may be interested in pursuing an
acquisition but had not been contacted given a perceived lower level of acquisition interest and concerns about
revealing Sumo Logic’s confidential information to competitors.
In the days following the January 27, 2023, meeting of the Sumo Logic Board, Sumo Logic management or
representatives of Morgan Stanley had the conversations authorized by the Sumo Logic Board. In response, (1)
Sponsor J, Sponsor L, Strategic 3 and Strategic 5 declined to pursue discussions regarding an acquisition of Sumo
Logic; (2) Sponsor K and Strategic 4 expressed preliminary interest in pursuing acquisition discussions; (3) Sponsor
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
A continued to express preliminary interest in pursuing acquisition discussions and expressed a theoretical ability to
potentially offer a price of approximately $13.00 in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock; and (4) Strategic 6
stated that it was unlikely that it would pursue an acquisition but required additional time to consider the opportunity
before confirming.
On January 31, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini
discussed with the members of the Corporate Governance Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of
Morgan Stanley provided an update on the status of discussions with potential strategic and financial sponsor
acquirors and the relative level of acquisition interest that each was then displaying. It was noted that after receiving
a subset of its requested due diligence information, Strategic 1 continued to request highly confidential diligence
information as a condition to submitting an acquisition proposal. It was the consensus of the Corporate Governance
Committee that Strategic 1 should be informed that it should provide a targeted list of the minimum due diligence
information that it required to make a preliminary acquisition proposal, and that Sumo Logic would evaluate that list.
Morgan Stanley was instructed to inform Strategic 1 of this decision. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed
the key terms of a proposed merger agreement that would be provided to potential acquirors. The Corporate
Governance Committee authorized providing the draft merger agreement to Francisco Partners and Sponsor D, with
instructions that such parties return a revised draft of the merger agreement with their acquisition proposals on or
prior to February 3, 2023. In view of the interest expressed by Sponsor A, the Corporate Governance Committee also
authorized providing Sponsor A with the draft merger agreement, but only if Sponsor A expressed an ability to
pursue an acquisition of Sumo Logic on an accelerated basis.
Later on January 31, 2023, Strategic 1 provided a list of the minimum due diligence information that it required to make
a preliminary acquisition proposal, which list continued to request a significant amount of Sumo Logic’s highly
confidential and competitively sensitive information.
Later on January 31, 2023, Morgan Stanley distributed the draft merger agreement to Francisco Partners and Sponsor
D.
Still later on January 31, 2023, Sponsor A entered into a confidentiality agreement with Sumo Logic, which included a
customary “standstill” restriction on Sponsor A’s ability to make public proposals to acquire Sumo Logic. However,
(1) all such restrictions terminated upon the announcement of the signing of the merger agreement; and (2) there were
no restrictions on Sponsor A’s ability to make private proposals to acquire Sumo Logic. Sponsor A was subsequently
granted access to the dataroom containing financial and business information with respect to Sumo Logic, and
informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Sponsor A required 30 to 45 days to complete its due diligence.
On February 2, 2023, representatives of each of Francisco Partners and Sponsor D met separately with members of
Sumo Logic management and representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss Sumo Logic’s anticipated business and
financial results for the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year.
Also on February 2, 2023, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Strategic 1. Consistent with
Corporate Governance Committee’s instruction, the representatives of Morgan Stanley explained Sumo Logic’s
concerns with sharing Sumo Logic’s highly confidential and competitively sensitive information without first
receiving a tangible indication from Strategic 1 that it was serious about acquiring Sumo Logic.
On February 3, 2023, Sponsor D informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it was withdrawing its acquisition
proposal and no longer pursuing an acquisition of Sumo Logic. Among the reasons cited was uncertainty
surrounding investor reaction to Sumo Logic’s results for the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year and the effect of
such results on Sumo Logic’s expected financial guidance for the first quarter and full 2024 fiscal year.
Also on February 3, 2023, Francisco Partners provided Sumo Logic with a non-binding proposal to acquire Sumo
Logic for $12.00 in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock (which proposal is referred to as the
“February proposal”). With the February proposal, Francisco Partners provided a revised draft of the merger
agreement and a draft of the equity commitment letter. The February proposal noted that Francisco Partners was
prepared to sign a definitive merger agreement and announce an acquisition of Sumo Logic within 48 hours.
On February 5, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
reviewed the terms of the February proposal from a financial point of view. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini
reviewed the key terms of the revised merger agreement from Francisco Partners. The Corporate Governance
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Committee discussed the advanced nature of acquisition discussions with Francisco Partners in relation to (1)
Sponsor D and its decision to withdraw its acquisition proposal; (2) Strategic 1’s continued insistence on receiving
highly confidential due diligence information as a condition to making a preliminary acquisition proposal; (3)
Strategic 4 and Sponsor K, each of which had stated an intent to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Sumo
Logic but had not done so at that time; (4) Sponsor A, which had stated that it required 30 to 45 days to complete due
diligence and had not provided any assurances concerning its ability to consummate an acquisition of Sumo Logic;
and (5) Strategic 6, whose status remained uncertain. Given (1) the significant time that would likely be required for
any of Strategic 1, Strategic 4, Strategic 6, Sponsor A or Sponsor K to submit an acquisition proposal (if they
submitted a proposal at all) and the potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Francisco Partners if Sumo
Logic sought to continue to pursue discussions with these other third parties; (2) Sponsor D’s decision to cease
acquisition discussions following its review of Sumo Logic’s earnings results (which results had not yet been
provided to any of Strategic 1, Strategic 4, Strategic 6, Sponsor A or Sponsor K); and (3) the ability of any interested
party to pursue an acquisition of Sumo Logic after entry into the merger agreement (so long as such acquisition met
certain objective standards), it was the consensus of the Corporate Governance Committee that pursuing the
February proposal was in the best interests of Sumo Logic and the Sumo Logic stockholders. The Corporate
Governance Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to inform Francisco Partners that the Sumo Logic Board was likely
to be supportive of the February proposal but expected the acquisition price to (1) represent a premium to Sumo
Logic’s closing stock price on the trading day prior to announcement of a transaction; and (2) be no less than $12.00
in cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock. The Corporate Governance Committee also instructed Wilson
Sonsini to negotiate the remaining terms of the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter with the goal of
signing the merger agreement as soon as possible. Following the meeting, Morgan Stanley informed Francisco
Partners of the decisions of the Corporate Governance Committee.
From February 5, 2023, until February 9, 2023, members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of Wilson
Sonsini, and representatives of each of Francisco Partners and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, legal counsel to Francisco
Partners (which we refer to as “Kirkland & Ellis”), met regularly to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement and
the equity commitment letter. The principal areas of negotiation in the merger agreement included (1) the
circumstances in which the Sumo Logic Board could change its recommendation to its stockholders or negotiate or
accept an alternative acquisition transaction; (2) the definition of “material adverse effect”; (3) the conditions to each
party’s obligation to consummate the merger; (4) the nature of each party’s right to terminate the merger agreement;
(5) the nature and scope of the interim operating covenants applicable to Sumo Logic during the period prior to the
closing of the merger; (6) the size of the termination fee payable by Sumo Logic in certain circumstances; and (7) the
cap on any damages available to Sumo Logic in the event that Sumo Logic terminated the merger agreement because
of Parent and Merger Sub’s failure to consummate the merger on the terms set forth in the merger agreement. The
representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis also negotiated the terms of the voting agreements.
On February 6, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of
each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the
members of the Sumo Logic Board their fiduciary duties. The decisions of the Corporate Governance Committee were
reviewed, along with the terms of the February proposal (including the terms of the revised merger agreement and
equity commitment letter provided by Francisco Partners). The Sumo Logic Board reviewed Morgan Stanley’s
customary relationship disclosures, which included disclosures with respect to Francisco Partners as well as Sumo
Logic (including the fact that in the past two-and-a-half years, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates had received
aggregate fees of approximately $5 to $10 million for financing services provided to Sumo Logic). The Sumo Logic
Board determined that no potential or actual conflicts would affect the ability of Morgan Stanley to fulfill its
responsibilities as financial advisor to Sumo Logic.
On February 8, 2023, the Corporate Governance Committee met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The open points in the merger
agreement were discussed.
Later on February 8, 2023, The Wall Street Journal published an article stating that Sumo Logic was nearing a deal to
be acquired by Francisco Partners at a price of $12.00 to $13.00 per share.
Still later on February 8, 2023, and following the close of trading on Nasdaq, representatives of Morgan Stanley met
with representatives of Francisco Partners. The representatives of Francisco Partners informed Morgan Stanley that
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Francisco Partners would not pay a premium to the closing price of Sumo Logic common stock on February 8, 2023
(which price was $12.18 per share). However, Francisco Partners did increase the value of its proposal to $12.05 in
cash per share of Sumo Logic common stock (which proposal is referred to as the “final proposal”).
Still later on February 8, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini
discussed with the members of the Sumo Logic Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
reviewed the terms of the final proposal from a financial point of view. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
confirmed that there were no changes to the customary relationship disclosures with Francisco Partners previously
provided to the Sumo Logic Board. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the key terms of the merger
agreement and the equity commitment letter. It was the consensus of the Sumo Logic Board to accept the final
proposal. The Sumo Logic Board instructed the representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley to
position Sumo Logic to be able to sign the merger agreement prior to the start of trading on Nasdaq on February 9,
2023.
Following the meeting of the Sumo Logic Board on February 8, 2023, members of Sumo Logic management and
representatives of Wilson Sonsini, and representatives of each of Francisco Partners and Kirkland & Ellis, finalized
the negotiations of the merger agreement, the equity commitment letter and the voting agreements.
Early on February 9, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met, with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives
of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with
the members of the Sumo Logic Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed
Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses of the final proposal. Morgan Stanley then rendered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of February 9, 2023, and based upon and subject to the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken
by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share consideration of $12.05 in cash to be received by
the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock, as
more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC” and
the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The Sumo Logic Board considered that the
per share price constitutes a premium of approximately 57 percent to Sumo Logic’s unaffected closing stock price on
January 20, 2023, the last full trading day prior to media reports regarding a possible acquisition of Sumo Logic. The
Sumo Logic Board, after considering the factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“-Recommendation of the Sumo Logic Board and Reasons for the Merger,” (1) determined that the merger agreement,
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were fair to, advisable and in the best
interests of Sumo Logic and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Sumo Logic, Parent and Merger Sub subsequently
signed the merger agreement.
Early on February 9, 2023, before the opening of trading on Nasdaq, Sumo Logic and Francisco Partners publicly
disclosed the signing of the merger agreement.
Following the signing of the merger agreement, it was discovered that for fiscal years 2024 through 2027 the
calculation of EBIT in the Projections included depreciation expense but inadvertently excluded the expense for the
amortization of intangible assets. As a result, adding both depreciation and amortization of intangible assets to EBIT
when calculating EBITDA in the Projections for the same period resulted in an additional add-back of amortization of
intangible assets and an overstatement of the calculated EBITDA. On March 24, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board met,
with members of Sumo Logic management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in
attendance. At the meeting, Sumo Logic’s management summarized the corrections required to the Projections to
adjust for the additional add-back of amortization of intangible assets in the Projections. The representatives of
Morgan Stanley noted that, of the financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion to the
Sumo Logic Board on February 9, 2023, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,” only its discounted cash flow analysis was impacted by this matter. The Morgan
Stanley representatives then reviewed with the Sumo Logic Board the results of its discounted cash flow analysis
based on the corrected Projections, including that the range of estimated implied value per share of Sumo Logic
common stock, as described more fully in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley
& Co. LLC,” would have been $8.60 - $12.45, rather than the stated $8.86 - $12.72. Following such review, the
representatives of Morgan Stanley confirmed to the Sumo Logic Board that the corrected Projections would not
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
have changed the conclusion set forth in its opinion as of the date it was delivered as of February 9, 2023. The Sumo
Logic Board considered the matter and determined that the adjustments to the Projections to correct for the
additional add-back of amortization of intangible assets would not have changed the Sumo Logic Board’s decision to
approve the merger agreement or its recommendation to the Sumo Logic stockholders to adopt the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Sumo Logic Board
On February 9, 2023, the Sumo Logic Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Sumo Logic
and its stockholders; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by Sumo Logic, the
performance by Sumo Logic of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; (3) recommended that the stockholders of Sumo Logic
adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby; and (4) directed that the adoption
of the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of Sumo Logic at a meeting thereof.
The Sumo Logic Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to its named
executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to
time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Sumo Logic Board consulted with Sumo Logic management,
as well as representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley. In recommending that Sumo Logic
stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, the Sumo Logic Board
considered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in
order of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed
below, the Sumo Logic Board concluded that entering into the merger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of Sumo Logic and Sumo Logic’s stockholders.
The Sumo Logic Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and
recommendation:
•
Business, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The Sumo Logic Board considered the current
and historical financial condition, results of operations, business and competitive positioning of Sumo Logic, as
well as Sumo Logic’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In particular, the Sumo
Logic Board considered Sumo Logic management’s then-current business plan, including the Projections.
Additional information about the preparation and substance of the Projections is contained in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “Projections.” The Sumo Logic Board considered this plan and the potential
opportunities that it presented against, among other things, various execution and other risks to achieving
management’s business plan, including (1) the likelihood that Sumo Logic management’s business plan could be
achieved in the face of operational and execution risks in the short and long term; (2) the impact of market,
customer and competitive trends on Sumo Logic; and (3) market volatility and the general risks related to market
conditions that could reduce the price of Sumo Logic common stock. Among the potential risks identified by the
Sumo Logic Board were:
○
Sumo Logic’s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among these
risks were consideration of (1) Sumo Logic’s size, as well as its financial resources, relative to those of its
competitors; (2) new and evolving competitive threats; (3) challenges to acquiring new customers or
retaining Sumo Logic’s existing customers, including challenges to increasing the productivity and
capacity of Sumo Logic’s sales force; and (4) other factors affecting the revenues, operating costs and
profitability of companies in Sumo Logic’s industry generally and other risk factors described in Sumo
Logic’s other filings with the SEC, as listed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You
Can Find More Information.”
45TABLE OF CONTENTS
○
Recent market volatility and the current and prospective business environment in which Sumo Logic
operates, including evolving macroeconomic headwinds facing Sumo Logic and its industry more generally
and the impact of changed economic circumstances on key customer segments, and the likely effect of
these factors on Sumo Logic and the execution of Sumo Logic's plans as an independent public company. 
○
Sumo Logic’s history of losses, and the challenges to achieving profitability in the near term, along with
evolving investor expectations regarding profitability at technology companies.
○
Sumo Logic’s financial results for the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year, which were below the company’s
internal forecast and analyst’s estimates of Sumo Logic’s financial performance on new annual recurring
revenue for that period.
○
The challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly traded
company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance. The Sumo Logic Board was
aware that the price of Sumo Logic common stock could be negatively impacted if Sumo Logic failed to
meet investor expectations, including if Sumo Logic failed to meet its growth or profitability objectives.
○
The historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of Sumo Logic
common stock.
•
Results of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of a comprehensive strategic review process
overseen by the Corporate Governance Committee. The Sumo Logic Board considered that, at Sumo Logic’s
direction, representatives of Morgan Stanley, together with representatives of Sumo Logic management and the
Sumo Logic Board, contacted 8 potential strategic acquirors and 15 financial sponsors (including Francisco
Partners) concerning their interest in an acquisition of Sumo Logic. The Sumo Logic Board considered the
nature of the engagement by each of these potential acquirors, and that, of these potential acquirors, only
Francisco Partners made a proposal for an acquisition of Sumo Logic that was capable of being accepted. The
Board was also aware of the public speculation since January 23, 2023, that Sumo Logic was pursuing a sale and
noted that, following such speculation, none of the potential acquirors that contacted Sumo Logic about
pursuing an acquisition made a proposal to acquire Sumo Logic. The Sumo Logic Board also considered the
potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Francisco Partners in the event it sought to continue to
pursue discussions with other third parties and the potential negative effect that a further extended process
might have on Sumo Logic’s business.
•
Cash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by Sumo Logic stockholders in
the merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business
and financial execution risks of management’s business plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates
uncertainty and risk for Sumo Logic stockholders related to the continued execution of Sumo Logic’s business.
•
Best Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Sumo Logic Board that the per share price represents the
best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of Sumo Logic common stock, taking into account the Sumo
Logic Board’s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and
general financial condition of Sumo Logic on a historical and prospective basis. In addition, the Sumo Logic
Board believed that, measured against Sumo Logic’s longer-term execution risks, the per share price reflects a
fair and favorable price for the shares of Sumo Logic common stock. The Sumo Logic Board also considered that
the per share price constitutes a premium of approximately 57 percent to Sumo Logic’s unaffected closing stock
price on January 20, 2023, the last full trading day prior to media reports regarding a possible acquisition of
Sumo Logic.
•
Potential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Sumo Logic Board that none of the possible
alternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate Sumo Logic as an independent
public company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of those
alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to Sumo Logic’s stockholders of those alternatives and
the timing and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities
for Sumo Logic to create greater value for Sumo Logic stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well
as business, competitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.
•
Fairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley. The oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, subsequently confirmed in writing,
that, as of February 9, 2023, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth

was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock. The opinion is
more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”
and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.
•
Negotiations with Parent and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement, which was
the product of arms’-length negotiations, and the belief of the Sumo Logic Board that the merger agreement
contained terms that provided Sumo Logic with a high level of closing certainty. The factors considered
included:
○
Sumo Logic’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with,
third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.
○
The Sumo Logic Board’s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third
parties from making a superior proposal.
○
The Sumo Logic Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its recommendation
that Sumo Logic stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
○
Sumo Logic’s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement. In that regard, the Sumo Logic Board believed that the termination fee
payable by Sumo Logic in such instance was reasonable, consistent with or below similar fees payable in
comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.
○
The limited conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the merger, making the merger reasonably
likely to be consummated.
○
Sumo Logic’s ability, under circumstances specified in the merger agreement and the equity commitment
letter, to specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded as contemplated
by the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter.
○
The commitment of the Guarantors to be obligated to fund the entire purchase price in the acquisition
pursuant to the terms of the equity commitment letter.
•
Reasonable Likelihood of Consummation. The belief of the Sumo Logic Board that an acquisition by Parent has
a reasonable likelihood of closing, including the Sumo Logic Board’s belief that there was a reasonable
likelihood that the regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger would be obtained.
•
Business Reputation of Francisco Partners. The Sumo Logic Board believed that the business reputation and
financial resources of Francisco Partners were factors that supported the conclusion that a transaction with
Parent (which is owned by Francisco Partners) could be completed quickly and in an orderly manner, and had a
substantial likelihood of being consummated successfully.
•
Appraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to Sumo Logic stockholders
(including beneficial owners of shares of Sumo Logic common stock) who timely and properly exercise such
appraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.
The Sumo Logic Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors
related to its recommendation, including the following:
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash transaction
means that Sumo Logic stockholders will not participate in Sumo Logic’s future earnings or growth and will not
benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation following the merger, whether as an
independent company or in combination with other Francisco Partners portfolio companies or assets. The Sumo
Logic Board also considered the other potential alternative strategies available to Sumo Logic as an independent
company, which, despite significant uncertainty, had the potential to result in a more successful and valuable
company.
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
No Ability to Solicit an Alternative Transaction. The restrictions in the merger agreement on Sumo Logic’s
ability to solicit competing proposals from the date of the merger agreement (subject to certain exceptions to
allow the Sumo Logic Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior proposal, and then only
upon the payment of the termination fee described below).
•
Termination Fee Payable by Sumo Logic. The requirement that Sumo Logic pay Parent a termination fee of $52.0
million under certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement, including if the Sumo Logic
Board terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal. The Sumo Logic Board considered the
potentially dampening effect that this termination fee could have on a third party’s interest in making a proposal
to acquire Sumo Logic.
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not be
consummated, and if it is not consummated, that: (1) Sumo Logic’s directors, senior management and other
employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant distractions from
their work on behalf of Sumo Logic during the pendency of the merger; (2) Sumo Logic will have incurred
significant transaction and other costs; (3) Sumo Logic’s continuing business relationships with customers,
business partners and employees may be adversely affected; (4) the trading price of Sumo Logic common stock
could be adversely affected; (5) the other contractual and legal remedies available to Sumo Logic in the event of
the termination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or both; and (6) the failure of the
merger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among Sumo Logic’s current and prospective
customers, employees and investors, which could cause an adverse impact on Sumo Logic’s operating results.
•
Parent Liability Limitation. The fact that Parent’s liabilities for monetary damages payable for breaches under
the merger agreement, or equity commitment letter are limited to $104.0 million.
•
Impact of Interim Restrictions on Sumo Logic’s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The
restrictions on Sumo Logic’s conduct of its business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may delay
or prevent Sumo Logic from undertaking strategic initiatives before the completion of the merger that, absent the
merger agreement, Sumo Logic might have pursued.
•
Effects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger, including the: (1)
effects on Sumo Logic’s employees, customers, operating results and stock price; (2) impact on Sumo Logic’s
ability to attract and retain management, sales and marketing and technical personnel; and (3) potential for
litigation in connection with the merger.
•
Taxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Sumo Logic common stock in the merger
will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for many Sumo Logic stockholders.
•
Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers. Interests that Sumo Logic’s directors and executive
officers may have in the merger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of Sumo Logic other
stockholders.
This discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors evaluated by the
Sumo Logic Board in its consideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the Sumo Logic
Board concluded that the potential benefits of entering into the merger agreement outweighed the uncertainties and
risks. In light of the variety of factors considered by the Sumo Logic Board and the complexity of these factors, the
Sumo Logic Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Sumo Logic
Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different relative
weights to the different factors. The Sumo Logic Board adopted and approved the merger agreement and the merger,
and recommended that Sumo Logic stockholders adopt the merger agreement, based upon the totality of the
information presented to, and considered by, the Sumo Logic Board. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set
forth above may contain forward-looking statements, which should be read in conjunction with the section of this
proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Sumo Logic retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and an opinion in connection with
the possible sale of Sumo Logic. The Sumo Logic Board selected Morgan Stanley to act as Sumo Logic’s financial
advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, extensive expertise and international reputation, its knowledge of
48TABLE OF CONTENTS
and involvement in recent transactions in Sumo Logic’s industry, and its knowledge of Sumo Logic’s business and
affairs given Morgan Stanley’s role as an underwriter in Sumo Logic’s initial public offering. At the meeting of the
Sumo Logic Board on February 9, 2023, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,
that, as of February 9, 2023, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in
the written opinion, the per share price of $12.05 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic
common stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of February 9, 2023, which sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex B and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The summary of the opinion of
Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You
are encouraged to read Morgan Stanley’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was
directed to the Sumo Logic Board, in its capacity as such, and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of
view of the per share price of $12.05 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock
(other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion
and does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or
other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and
does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how our stockholders should vote at the special meeting.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of
Sumo Logic;
•
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Sumo
Logic;
•
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by Sumo Logic management and certain extrapolations
prepared by Morgan Stanley with guidance from Sumo Logic management (which were reviewed and
approved by Sumo Logic management for Morgan Stanley’s use) (which we refer to collectively as the
“Projections” for the purposes of this section; see also the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Projections”);

senior executives of Sumo Logic;
•
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Sumo Logic common stock;
•
compared the financial performance of Sumo Logic and the prices and trading activity of Sumo Logic
common stock with that of certain other publicly traded companies comparable with Sumo Logic and their
securities;
•
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
•
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Sumo Logic and Parent and
their financial and legal advisors;
•

commitment letter, substantially in the form of the draft dated February 9, 2023, and certain related
documents; and
•
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as
Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan
Stanley by Sumo Logic and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the Projections,
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of Sumo Logic management of the future financial performance of Sumo Logic. Morgan
Stanley expressed no view as to the Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan
Stanley assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement
without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent will
obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the equity commitment letter, and that the definitive merger
agreement and equity commitment letter would not differ in any material respect from the drafts thereof furnished to
Morgan Stanley on February 9, 2023. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the
necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays,
limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated
benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor.
Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of
Sumo Logic and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction,
or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley
expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Sumo
Logic’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the per share price of $12.05 in cash
to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock (other than as specified in the merger
agreement) in the merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities of Sumo Logic, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, February 9, 2023. Events occurring after February 9, 2023 may
affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion
as of February 9, 2023, subsequently confirmed in writing as of such date, to the Sumo Logic Board. The following
summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors
considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the
relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley,
the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a
whole; considering any portion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and
factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and was
directed by the Sumo Logic Board to rely upon, among other matters, (1) the Projections and (2) the average of
estimates by equity research analysts as of February 8, 2023 (which we refer to as the “street case”), which included
extrapolations for calendar year 2025 prepared by Morgan Stanley that were reviewed and approved for Morgan
Stanley’s use by Sumo Logic management). For the purposes of Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses presented to
the Sumo Logic Board on February 9, 2023 and this section, the fiscal years as set forth in the Projections are
represented as calendar years, with each calendar year representing the subsequent fiscal year, such that, for
example, calendar year 2023 represents Sumo Logic’s fiscal year 2024. The Projections are more fully described below
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Projections.” In accordance with direction from the Sumo Logic
Board, Morgan Stanley utilized the Projections and street case in its financial analyses described below.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a
company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared
certain financial estimates for Sumo Logic with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research
estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things,
similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar
operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the “comparable companies”). These companies were
the following:
•
Alteryx Inc.
•
Confluent, Inc.
•
Datadog Inc.
•
Domo, Inc.
•
Dynatrace Inc.
•
Elastic NV
•
Everbridge, Inc.

•
GitLab Inc.
•
HashiCorp Inc.
•
JFrog Ltd.
•
New Relic Inc.
•
PagerDuty Inc.
•
Splunk Inc.
•
Zuora, Inc.
Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value (which we refer to as “A
V”) for each of the comparable
companies utilizing publicly available financial information as of February 8, 2023 to estimated revenue for each of
calendar years 2023 (which is referred to as “CY23”) and 2024 (which we refer to as “CY24”). Morgan Stanley
referred to these ratios as AV/CY2023E Revenue and AV/CY2024E Revenue, respectively. For purposes of its
analyses, Morgan Stanley defined “aggregate value” as a company’s fully diluted equity value plus total debt, less
cash and cash equivalents.
Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its
professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of AV/CY2023E Revenue of
2.0x - 4.5x and AV/CY2024E Revenue of 2.0x - 4.0x and applied these ranges to the estimated revenue for Sumo Logic
for calendar years 2023 and 2024 based on each of the Projections and the street case.
Based on the outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock on a fully diluted basis, as provided by Sumo Logic
management on February 3, 2023, and Sumo Logic’s net cash as of February 3, 2023 as provided by Sumo Logic
management, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Sumo Logic common stock as
follows:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Sumo Logic. In evaluating the
comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Sumo
Logic’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Sumo Logic’s business and the
industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and
prospects of Sumo Logic and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as
determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a theoretical
estimate of the potential future equity value of a company’s common stock as a function of such company’s
estimated future revenue and a range of trading multiples. The resulting estimated future implied equity value is
subsequently discounted back to the present day to arrive at an illustrative estimate of the present value for the
company’s theoretical future implied stock price. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range
of implied present equity values per share of Sumo Logic common stock on a standalone basis for each of the
Projections and the street case.
Morgan Stanley calculated ranges of implied equity values per share of Sumo Logic common stock as of February 8,
2023. To calculate the discounted equity value per share of Sumo Logic common stock, Morgan Stanley used
calendar year 2025 estimated revenue based on each of the Projections and the street case. For each scenario,
Morgan Stanley calculated the future-implied fully diluted equity value of Sumo Logic as of February 8, 2025 (1) with
respect to the street case, by applying a representative range for the ratio of aggregate value to the estimated
revenue for calendar year 2025 of 2.0x - 4.5x to Sumo Logic’s calendar year 2025 estimated revenue based on the street
case; (2) with respect to the Projections, by applying a representative range for the ratio of aggregate value to
estimated revenue for calendar year 2025 of 3.5x - 5.5x to Sumo Logic’s calendar year 2025 estimated revenue based
the Projections and (3) in each case, adding Sumo Logic’s future net cash estimate (with such estimates provided by
Sumo Logic management for the Projections and extrapolated for the street case (which extrapolations were reviewed
and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by Sumo Logic management)). In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided
the future implied fully diluted equity value by estimated future diluted shares outstanding to calculate a future
equity value per share. Morgan Stanley discounted the resulting future equity values per share to February 8, 2023
using a discount rate equal to Sumo Logic’s assumed cost of equity of 13.1 percent, which cost of equity was
selected based on the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. Based on these
calculations, this analysis implied the following value ranges per share of Sumo Logic common stock:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a
company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company.
Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for Sumo Logic common stock based on a
discounted cash flow analysis to value Sumo Logic as a stand-alone public company. Morgan Stanley utilized
estimates from the Projections for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, (1) less stock-based compensation expense; (2) less taxes; (3) less capital
expenditures; and (4) plus or minus changes in net working capital, for calendar years 2023 through 2032, which
estimated unlevered free cash flows were reviewed and approved by Sumo Logic management for Morgan Stanley’s
use. The free cash flows and terminal value were then discounted, using a mid-year convention, to present values as
of January 31, 2023, at a discount rate ranging from 12.1 percent to 14.1 percent, which discount rates were selected
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of Sumo
Logic’s weighted average cost of capital. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted to add net cash as of
February 3, 2023 and further adjusted to add the net present value of net operating losses as provided by Sumo Logic
management.
Based on the outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Sumo Logic
management on February 3, 2023, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Sumo Logic
common stock as follows:

In mid-March 2023, subsequent to the rendering of its opinion to the Sumo Logic Board, Morgan Stanley determined
and informed Sumo Logic management and the Sumo Logic Board that based on the adjustments to the Projections
as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Background of the Merger,” the range of estimated
implied value per share of Sumo Logic common stock shown in the table immediately preceding this sentence would
have been $8.60 - $12.45, rather than the stated $8.86 - $12.72.
Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a
company based on publicly available financial terms, by reviewing publicly available statistics for selected
comparable transactions. Such comparable transactions were selected because they shared certain characteristics
with the merger, most notably because they were similar software transactions. For each such transaction, Morgan
Stanley noted the ratio of aggregate value of the transaction to each of the target company’s estimated revenue for
the next 12-month period following the announcement date of the applicable transaction (which we refer to as “NTM
Revenue”).
The following is the list of such reviewed transactions:

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable transactions and upon the application of its
professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges for the ratio of aggregate
value to the estimated NTM Revenue of 3.0x to 7.0x and applied these ranges to Sumo Logic’s estimated NTM
Revenue as of February 8, 2023, based on the street case to calculate a range of implied equity values per share of
Sumo Logic common stock. The results of the analysis were as follows:

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Sumo Logic or the merger. In
evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond Sumo Logic’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Sumo
Logic’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the
financial condition and prospects of Sumo Logic and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which
could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the
transactions to which the merger is being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present value per
share of Sumo Logic derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the per share
price in connection with the merger is not necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of
the consideration for the merger, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered as part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis
with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Sumo Logic Board.
Illustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums
Morgan Stanley reviewed the premiums paid by acquirers in selected public company technology transactions
occurring between 2011 and February 8, 2023, with aggregate values greater than $250 million. Morgan Stanley
selected such public company technology transactions because of certain shared characteristics with the merger
based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. For each transaction in the analyses, Morgan
Stanley noted, where available: (1) the implied premium to the acquired company’s closing share price on the last
trading day prior to announcement (or, as applicable, on the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by
acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); and (2) the implied premium to the acquired company’s 30-day
average closing share price prior to announcement (or, as applicable, the last trading day prior to the share price
being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news).
Morgan Stanley also reviewed the premiums paid by acquirers in such selected public company technology
transactions since the beginning of 2022 as an indication of premiums paid on recent technology transactions. For
each transaction in the analysis, Morgan Stanley noted, where available, the implied premium to the acquired
company’s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or, as applicable, on the last trading
day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news).
Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment
and experience, Morgan Stanley selected (1) a representative range of premia based on the selected transactions
occurring between 2011 and February 8, 2023 and applied such range to Sumo Logic’s closing share price on January
20, 2023 (the last trading day prior to public rumors regarding a potential transaction); (2) a representative range of
premia based on the selected transactions occurring between 2011 and February 8, 2023 and applied such range to
Sumo Logic’s closing share price during the 30 trading days prior to and including January 20, 2023; and (3) a
representative range of premia based on the selected transactions occurring since the beginning of 2022 and applied
such range to Sumo Logic’s closing share price on January 20, 2023.

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley reviewed publicly available equity research analysts’ share price targets for Sumo Logic common
stock as of January 20, 2023. Morgan Stanley used the lowest and highest undiscounted price targets issued by
those research analysts with publicly available price targets for shares of Sumo Logic, resulting in a range of $8.50 to
$18.00 per share of Sumo Logic common stock, with a median of $10.00 per share.
Morgan Stanley then calculated the range of discounted price targets for Sumo Logic by discounting such targets for
one year. Based on an estimated cost of equity of 13.1 percent for Sumo Logic, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of
discounted price targets of $7.51 to $15.91 per share of Sumo Logic common stock, with a median of $8.84 per share.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current
market trading prices for Sumo Logic common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the
future financial performance of Sumo Logic and future financial market conditions.
General
In connection with the review of the merger by the Sumo Logic Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of an opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion,
Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to
any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without
considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and
opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other
analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As
a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be
Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual value of Sumo Logic.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous judgments and assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond Sumo Logic’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Sumo
Logic’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the
financial condition and prospects of Sumo Logic and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any
estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial
point of view of the per share price of $12.05 in cash to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common
55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement and in connection with the
delivery of its opinion dated as of February 9, 2023, to the Sumo Logic Board. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or reflect the prices at which shares of Sumo Logic common stock might actually trade.
The aggregate per share price to be received by the holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock (other than as
specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through arm’s-length
negotiations between Sumo Logic and Francisco Partners and was approved by the Sumo Logic Board. Morgan
Stanley provided financial advice to the Sumo Logic Board during these negotiations but did not, however,
recommend any specific consideration to Sumo Logic or the Sumo Logic Board, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that
any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion
did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other
alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was
not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how our stockholders should vote at
the special meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Sumo Logic Board were among the many factors taken into
consideration by the Sumo Logic Board to recommend that the Sumo Logic Board approve and adopt the merger
agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of
the Sumo Logic Board with respect to the consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Sumo
Logic Board would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved
by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s
customary practice.
The Sumo Logic Board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and
expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and
individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and
brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, and prime brokerage, as well as
providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and
officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance
positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their
customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Sumo Logic, Parent, Francisco Partners or its affiliates and their
affiliated funds’ respective portfolio companies (which are referred to collectively herein as the “Francisco Partners
Related Entities”) and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be
involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or
officers, including individuals working with Sumo Logic in connection with the merger, may have committed and may
commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Francisco Partners, or the Francisco Partners
Related Entities or in affiliates of Morgan Stanley that may hold direct equity and/or partnership interests in private
equity funds managed by Francisco Partners or the Francisco Partners Related Entities.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Sumo Logic Board financial advisory services
and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the
merger, and Sumo Logic has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $29.0 million for its services, $6.0
million of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to this proxy
statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Sumo Logic
has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other
professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Sumo Logic has agreed to indemnify
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other
person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws.
In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not provided
financial advisory or financing services to Sumo Logic and have not received any fees for such services from Sumo
Logic. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have
provided financial advisory and financing services to Francisco Partners and certain of its majority-controlled
affiliates and
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
have received aggregate fees of less than approximately $1.0 million in connection with such services. Morgan
Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Sumo Logic, Francisco Partners or the
Francisco Partners Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the
rendering of these services.
Projections",58,67
"Sumo Logic, Inc._20230405_DEFM14A_20779809_4641204.Pdf",Projections,"Projections
Other than in connection with Sumo Logic’s regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, and in
connection with its investor day, Sumo Logic does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to its future
financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the
underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Sumo Logic management regularly prepares, and the Sumo Logic
Board regularly evaluates, prospective financial information relating to Sumo Logic’s future performance as part of its
long-term business planning. Sumo Logic management regularly makes and reviews with the Sumo Logic Board
updates to its long-term business plan, including to reflect actual results and trends and changes in Sumo Logic’s
performance and the industry in which it operates.
As part of Sumo Logic’s evaluation of strategic alternatives (including continuing as an independent public
company), Sumo Logic management prepared and reviewed with the Corporate Governance Committee and the Sumo
Logic Board unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2024 through 2026 contained in the January
2023 long-range plan, together with extrapolations for fiscal years 2027 through 2033 (the “extrapolations”). The
extrapolations for fiscal year 2027 were prepared by Sumo Logic management. The extrapolations for fiscal years 2028
through 2033 were prepared by Morgan Stanley at the direction of the Corporate Governance Committee and were
reviewed and approved by Sumo Logic management. For purposes of this proxy statement, we refer to the unaudited
prospective financial information for fiscal years 2024 through 2026 contained in the January 2023 long-range plan,
together with the extrapolations, as the “Projections.” The Projections were prepared for internal use only and not
for public disclosure and were provided by Sumo Logic management to the Corporate Governance Committee and the
Sumo Logic Board for the purposes of their consideration, analyses and evaluation of the merger and other strategic
alternatives.
At the direction of the Sumo Logic Board, the Projections were used by Morgan Stanley for purposes of performing
its financial analyses in connection with rendering its opinion to the Sumo Logic Board (as more fully described in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”). In addition, a subset of the
unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2024 through 2026 contained in the January 2023 long-
range plan were provided to Francisco Partners prior to the execution of the merger agreement, and to certain other
potential acquirors, as part of acquisition discussions and to assist in their respective due diligence review during
Sumo Logic’s strategic review process. For more information on the preparation and use of the Projections, please
see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “-Background of the Merger” and “-Opinion of Morgan Stanley &
Co. LLC.”
The Projections were prepared and/or approved by, and are the sole responsibility of, Sumo Logic management. At
Sumo Logic’s direction, Morgan Stanley relied on the accuracy and completeness of the Projections utilized in its
financial analyses and its advice to the Sumo Logic Board, as well as the assurances of Sumo Logic management that
(1) it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading; and (2)
the Projections were reasonably prepared and/or approved based on the best currently available estimates and
judgments of Sumo Logic management of the future financial performance of Sumo Logic.
The Projections were developed and/or approved by Sumo Logic management as then-current estimates of Sumo
Logic’s future financial performance as an independent public company. The Projections do not give effect to the
merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the merger agreement, the expenses that have already
and will be incurred in connection with completing the merger, or any changes to Sumo Logic’s operations or strategy
that may be implemented in connection with the pendency of, or following the consummation of, the merger. The
Projections also do not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed; the Projections should not be
viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Projections constitute forward-looking statements. The Projections are not included in this proxy statement to
influence any decision on whether to vote for the merger proposal or any other proposal presented at the special
meeting, but rather are included in this proxy statement to give stockholders access to certain non-public information
that was provided to the Corporate Governance Committee, the Sumo Logic Board and Morgan Stanley for the
purposes described above. By including the Projections in this proxy statement, none of the Corporate Governance
57TABLE OF CONTENTS
Committee, the Sumo Logic Board, Sumo Logic, Sumo Logic management, Morgan Stanley or any person has made or
makes any representation to any person regarding Sumo Logic’s ultimate performance as compared to the information
contained in the Projections. The inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that the
Corporate Governance Committee, the Sumo Logic Board, Sumo Logic, Sumo Logic management, Morgan Stanley or
any other person considered, or now considers such information to be necessarily predictive of Sumo Logic’s actual
future results, and such information should not be relied on as such. Further, the inclusion of the Projections in this
proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Sumo Logic that the information presented is
material.
The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In addition, the Projections were not prepared with a view
toward complying with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. Sumo Logic’s
independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has not audited, reviewed, examined,
compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Projections and, accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Sumo Logic’s
previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Projections and should not be read to do so.
Although the Projections are presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates as
to future events made by Sumo Logic management that Sumo Logic management believed in good faith were
reasonable at the time that the Projections were prepared. Sumo Logic’s ability to achieve the financial results
contemplated by the Projections will be affected by its ability to achieve its strategic goals, objectives and targets
over the applicable periods, and will be subject to related operational and execution risks. The Projections reflect
assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual
results and cause the Projections not to be achieved can be found in the risk factors included in Sumo Logic’s
periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of Sumo
Logic’s control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Projections will be realized, and Sumo Logic’s actual
results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Projections. For information on factors that may
cause Sumo Logic’s future results to materially vary, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-
Looking Statements.” The Projections may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and do not consider
any events or circumstances after the date that they were prepared, including the announcement of the entry into the
merger agreement. You should evaluate the Projections, if at all, in conjunction with Sumo Logic’s historical financial
statements and other information regarding Sumo Logic contained in Sumo Logic’s public filings with the SEC. The
Projections may not be consistent with Sumo Logic’s historical operating data as a result of the assumptions utilized
in preparing such information. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, Sumo Logic does
not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such
information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events.
Because the Projections reflect estimates and judgments, they are susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as
well as to multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Projections also cover
multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The
Projections are not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the
Projections are not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of Sumo Logic’s future results
or for purposes of making any investment decision.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Projections are non-GAAP financial measures (which we refer to as
the “non-GAAP financial measures”). These are financial performance measures that are not calculated in
accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP
financial measures, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits
that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be
considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a
business combination transaction, such as the Projections, are excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP financial
measures” under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Projections are not subject to SEC rules
regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial
measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Corporate Governance Committee, the Sumo Logic Board,
Morgan Stanley or any other person. Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the
Projections is provided in this proxy statement.
In preparing and approving the Projections, Sumo Logic management utilized the following material assumptions.
Sumo Logic management using its business judgement, believed in good faith that these assumptions were
reasonable:
•
A decline in revenue growth to 14 percent in fiscal year 2024 before reaccelerating to 21 percent and 26
percent in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, respectively. These assumptions reflect expected future productivity
improvements from Sumo Logic’s sales team in addition to incremental capacity. In addition, these growth
rates assume marginal improvements in the renewal rate of existing customer contracts from approximately
89 percent in fiscal year 2024 to 92 percent by fiscal year 2026.
•
Consistent EBIT growth from fiscal year 2024 through fiscal year 2026 as a result of realizing future
efficiencies as Sumo Logic’s business scales. In addition, EBIT margin ranging from negative 10 percent in
fiscal year 2024 to 7 percent in fiscal year 2026. This growth reflects (1) Sumo Logic’s expectations of
efficiencies across the sales organization as the segmentation, partner first strategy and other changes
implemented in fiscal year 2023 resulting in improved productivity per seller; (2) efficiencies in the research
and development organization resulting from a streamlined operating structure and better leverage from
lower cost geographies; and (3) automation and streamlining of processes in the general and administrative
function as the company scales.
•
Stock based compensation expense ranging from 23 percent to 18 percent of revenue for fiscal years 2024
through 2026, reflecting Sumo Logic managements plan to utilize equity more selectively as a component of
compensation as is typical as companies mature.
•
Unlevered free cash flow is expected to improve as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2026. These
improvements are the result of the expected revenue growth and the reduction in our operating expenses as
a percentage of revenue.
•
No material acquisitions or divestures by Sumo Logic.
The following table presents a summary of the Projections. This table corrects for the additional add-back of
amortization of intangible assets for fiscal years 2024 through 2027 that is further described in the section of this

When considering the recommendation of the Sumo Logic Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, you should be aware that Sumo Logic’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the
merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Sumo Logic’s stockholders. Additionally, concurrently
with the execution of the merger agreement, Sumo Logic’s directors, in their capacities as stockholders of Sumo
Logic, entered into the voting agreements with Parent and Sumo Logic. The voting agreements obligate these
persons to vote their respective shares of Sumo Logic common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and for any proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting to a later date if Sumo Logic or Parent
proposes or requests such postponement or adjournment in accordance with the merger agreement, and against any
action, agreement, or proposal that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the merger. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger
agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Sumo Logic’s
stockholders, the Sumo Logic Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the
time, among other matters. These interests are more fully described below.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of Sumo Logic will be entitled to certain
ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage, including under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Indemnification and
Insurance.”
Treatment of Equity Awards
Treatment of Sumo Logic Restricted Stock Units
As of February 28, 2023, there were outstanding awards of Sumo Logic RSUs (or portions thereof) that cover an
aggregate of 14,855,129 shares of Sumo Logic common stock, of which Sumo Logic RSUs covering an aggregate of
323,671 shares of Sumo Logic common stock were held by Sumo Logic’s current non-employee directors and of
which Sumo Logic RSUs covering an aggregate of 1,877,104 shares of Sumo Logic common stock were held by Sumo
Logic’s current executive officers and Christian Beedgen, Sumo Logic’s co-founder, Chief Technology Officer, and a
member of the Sumo Logic Board.
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Sumo Logic RSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock
subject to such vested Sumo Logic RSU multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Sumo Logic RSU will be cancelled and converted into a converted
cash award (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject to such
unvested Sumo Logic RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as
otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted cash award will continue to be subject to, the same
vesting terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding unvested Sumo Logic RSU immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger.
For more information regarding the treatment of Sumo Logic RSUs held by Sumo Logic’s directors and executive
officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.”
Treatment of Sumo Logic Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
As of February 28, 2023, there were no outstanding awards of Sumo Logic PSUs covering shares of Sumo Logic
common stock.
60TABLE OF CONTENTS
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Sumo Logic PSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock
subject to such vested Sumo Logic PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award
agreement), multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Sumo Logic PSU will be cancelled and converted into a converted
cash award (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject to such
unvested Sumo Logic PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements),
multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger
agreement, each such converted cash award will be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions (excluding
performance-based vesting conditions) as applied to the corresponding unvested Sumo Logic RSU immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger.
Treatment of Sumo Logic Options
As of February 28, 2023, 10,463,722 shares were subject to outstanding Sumo Logic options, of which 9,822,230 have
an exercise price below the per share price. Sumo Logic options to purchase an aggregate of 550,000 shares of Sumo
Logic common stock were held by Sumo Logic’s current non-employee directors and Sumo Logic options to
purchase an aggregate of 5,099,771 shares of Sumo Logic common stock were held by Sumo Logic’s current executive
officers and Mr. Beedgen.
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Sumo Logic option will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock
subject to the vested Sumo Logic option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the exercise
price per share of such vested Sumo Logic option, less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger each unvested Sumo Logic option will be cancelled and converted into a
converted cash award (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject
to such unvested Sumo Logic option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the exercise price
per share of such unvested Sumo Logic option, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in
the merger agreement, each such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting
terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding unvested Sumo Logic option immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger.
Any underwater Sumo Logic option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration or
payment.
For more information regarding the treatment of Sumo Logic options held by Sumo Logic’s directors and executive
officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.”
Treatment of the ESPP
Prior to the effective time of the merger, we will take all actions necessary to, (1) provide that no new individuals will
be permitted to enroll in the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement; (2) make any adjustments that
may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for
all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (3) not allow any increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction
elections under the ESPP during the current purchase period from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement;
(4) cause the exercise (as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of
each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP, but otherwise not issue any of Sumo Logic common stock
under the ESPP; (5) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP on
or after the date of the merger agreement; and (6) not extend the current purchase period. Immediately prior to and
effective as of the effective time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), we will terminate the
ESPP and no further rights will be granted or exercised under the ESPP after such termination. Of Sumo Logic’s
executive officers, two are enrolled in the ESPP for the current purchase period. Sumo Logic’s non-employee directors
are not eligible to participate in the ESPP.

(1)
Represents shares of Sumo Logic common stock directly held by the individual as of February 28, 2023. The number of shares
shown does not include shares of Sumo Logic common stock that the executive officer may purchase after the date of the merger
agreement under the ESPP. For additional information regarding the treatment of Sumo Logic’s ESPP in the merger, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment
of Equity Awards.” For additional information regarding beneficial ownership of common stock, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.”
(2)
Represents outstanding vested in-the-money Sumo Logic options held by the individual. All options held by the individuals named
in the table above are in-the-money, and all such options shown in the column are vested as of February 28, 2023. The values
shown are determined as the excess of (i) the total number of vested shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject to such Sumo
Logic options multiplied by the per share price, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price for such Sumo Logic options.
(3)
Represents outstanding unvested in-the-money Sumo Logic options held by the individual. All options held by the individuals
named in the table above are in-the-money, and all such options shown in the column are not scheduled to vest on or before
February 28, 2023. The values shown are determined as the excess of (i) the total number of unvested shares of Sumo Logic
common stock subject to such Sumo Logic options multiplied by the per share price, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price for
such Sumo Logic options. Each of the Sumo Logic executive officers is eligible for vesting acceleration of his or her unvested
Sumo Logic options in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment under his or her change in control and
severance agreement. For additional information regarding the Sumo Logic options for Sumo Logic’s named executive officers,
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-
Golden Parachute Compensation.”
(4)
Represents outstanding Sumo Logic RSUs that are not scheduled to vest on or before February 28, 2023. The values shown with
respect to Sumo Logic RSUs are determined as the product of the per share price, multiplied by the total number of shares of
Sumo Logic common stock subject to Sumo Logic RSUs. As described further in the sections of this proxy statement captioned “-
Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity Awards-Non-Employee Director
Equity Awards,” Sumo Logic’s RSUs outstanding as of the date of the closing of the merger (which date, solely for purposes of
this proxy statement, is assumed to be February 28, 2023) that are held by Sumo Logic’s non-employee directors will accelerate
vesting in full. In addition, each of the Sumo Logic
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
executive officers is eligible for vesting acceleration of his or her Sumo Logic RSUs in connection with certain qualifying
terminations of employment under his or her change in control and severance agreement. For additional information regarding
the Sumo Logic RSUs for Sumo Logic’s named executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Interests
of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Mr. Jenkins resigned from the Sumo Logic Board effective September 16, 2022.
(6)
Mr. Robel resigned from the Sumo Logic Board effective March 3, 2023.
Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships
Non-Employee Director Equity Awards
We have granted certain stock-based awards such as stock options and RSUs under Sumo Logic’s 2020 Equity
Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the “2020 plan”) and Sumo Logic’s 2010 Stock Plan, as amended, that are
outstanding and held by Sumo Logic’s non-employee directors and executive officers, including pursuant to Sumo
Logic’s Outside Director Compensation Policy that are held by Sumo Logic’s non-employee directors. Pursuant to the
2020 plan or the terms of the award, equity awards granted to Sumo Logic’s non-employee directors will accelerate
vesting upon a “change in control.” The closing of the merger will be a “change in control” within the meaning of
Sumo Logic’s 2020 plan or the terms of the award.
Change in Control and Severance Agreements
We have entered into a change in control and severance agreement with each of Sumo Logic’s current executive
officers that provides for the severance and change in control benefits as described below.
If an executive officer’s employment is terminated within the period beginning three months before a change in
control and ending 18 months following a change in control either (1) by us (or any of Sumo Logic’s subsidiaries)
without cause (excluding by reason of death or disability); or (2) by the executive officer for good reason, the
executive officer will receive the following benefits if the executive officer timely signs and does not revoke a release
of claims in Sumo Logic’s favor:
•
a lump-sum payment, less applicable withholdings, equal to the sum of (x) 12 months (or, in the case of Mr.
Sayar, 18 months) of the executive officer’s annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to such
termination (or if such termination is due to a resignation for good reason based on a material reduction in
base salary, then as in effect immediately prior to the reduction or if greater, at the level in effect immediately
prior to the change in control); and (y) 100 percent (or, in the case of Mr. Sayar, 150 percent) of the
executive officer’s target annual bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs;
•
payment of premiums for coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended (which we refer to as “COBRA”) for the executive officer and the executive officer’s eligible
dependents, if any, for up to 12 months, (or, in the case of Mr. Sayar, 18 months) or taxable monthly
payments for the equivalent period in the event payment of the COBRA premiums would violate, or be
subject to an excise tax under, applicable law; and
•
100 percent accelerated vesting and exercisability (as applicable) of all outstanding equity awards and, in
the case of an equity award with performance-based vesting unless otherwise specified in the applicable
equity award agreement governing such award, all performance goals and other vesting criteria generally
will be deemed achieved at the greater of actual achievement (if determinable), or 100 percent of target
levels.
If any of the amounts provided for under these change in control and severance agreements or otherwise payable to
an executive officer would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code and could be subject to the related excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then
the executive officer will be entitled to receive either full payment of benefits under his or her change in control and
severance agreement or such lesser amount that would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to the excise
tax, whichever results in the greater amount of after-tax benefits to the executive officer.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding certain
compensation for each of Sumo Logic’s named executive officers that is based on, or that otherwise relates to, the
merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules,
63
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable to Sumo Logic’s named
executive officers. Sumo Logic’s “named executive officers” for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy statement are
Ramin Sayar, Stewart Grierson, Suku Krishnaraj Chettiar, Lynne Doherty, Katherine Haar, and Sydney Carey. For
additional details regarding the terms of the payments quantified below, see the sections of this proxy statement
captioned “-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity Awards”
and “-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance
Agreements.”
The amounts in the table are estimated using the following assumptions and such additional assumptions as may be
set forth in the footnotes to the table:
•
that the effective time of the merger will occur on February 28, 2023 (which is the assumed closing date of
the merger solely for purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure); and
•
that the current named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination of his or her employment at
the effective time of the merger that resulted in severance benefits becoming payable to such named
executive officer under his or her change in control and severance agreement.
The amounts reported below are estimates based on these and other assumptions that may or may not actually occur
or be accurate on the date the merger actually closes. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named
executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth below. Sumo Logic’s named
executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, or tax reimbursements in connection
with the merger. As required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value
of Sumo Logic common stock have been calculated based on the per share price.

Ms. Carey served as Sumo Logic’s chief financial officer until August 2, 2021, and continued to serve as an advisor to Sumo

on or otherwise relating to the merger.

Reflects the amount of “double-trigger” payments to which the named executive officer may become entitled under their change
in control and severance agreement. The amount becomes payable if, during the period beginning three months before Sumo
Logic’s “change in control” through 18 months after Sumo Logic’s change in control, Sumo Logic terminates their employment
with Sumo Logic for a reason other than “cause” (excluding by reason of death or disability) or they resign for “good reason,” as
such terms are defined in the named executive officer’s change in control and severance agreement, subject to the named
executive officer timely signing and not revoking Sumo Logic’s then-standard separation agreement and release of claims (which
may include an agreement not to disparage Sumo Logic, non-solicit provisions, an agreement to assist in any litigation matters,
and other standard terms and conditions) and provided the named executive officer returns all documents and other property
provided by Sumo Logic and resigns from all officer and director positions. Such termination is referred to as a “qualifying
termination.”
The amounts represent a lump-sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of (x) 18 months for Mr. Sayar, and 12 months for
Sumo Logic’s other current named executive officers, of annual base salary as in effect as of February 28, 2023; and (y) 150
percent for Mr. Sayar and 100 percent for Sumo Logic’s other current named executive officers of such named executive
officer’s target annual bonus as in effect for fiscal year 2023, as follows:

Equity. The numbers in the table represent the value of accelerated vesting of outstanding unvested in-the-money Sumo Logic
options, Sumo Logic RSUs and Sumo Logic PSUs (based on the assumptions described below). As described in the section above
titled “Treatment of Equity Awards,” these equity awards will be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive a
cash payment subject to vesting.
The values in the equity column of the tables above and below reflect the accelerated vesting terms of the named executive
officer’s change in control and severance agreement and the following assumptions:
•
the closing date of the merger occurs on February 28, 2023, and the performance targets relating to the Company PSU
awards were not achieved;
•
the named executive officer’s employment is terminated in connection with a qualifying termination (but after the time
such equity awards are cancelled and converted by Parent), such that the named executive officer’s outstanding and
unvested Sumo Logic equity awards will vest in full, which is a “double-trigger” benefit; and
•
the values for the equity awards are calculated based on the per share price of $12.05, less any exercise price.

Perquisites / Benefits. For each of the named executive officers, the amount shown represents the cost of payment of premiums
for coverage under COBRA for the named executive officer and such named executive officer’s eligible dependents, if any, for up
to 18 months for Mr. Sayar and up to 12 months for the other current named executive officers, which becomes payable upon a
qualifying termination, and accordingly these amounts are “double-trigger” payments.

Total. This amount includes the aggregate dollar value of the sum of all amounts reported in the preceding columns. If any of the
amounts provided for under the individual’s change in control and severance agreement or otherwise payable to any of the named
executive officers would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and could be subject
to the related excise tax, the named executive officer would be entitled to receive either full payment of his or her benefits or
such lesser amount which would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the
greater amount of after-tax benefits to the named executive officer.
Employment Arrangements Following the Merger
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Sumo Logic’s executive officers have (1) reached an understanding on
potential employment or other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with Parent or Merger Sub; or (2)
entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding employment or other retention with the surviving
corporation or with Parent or Merger Sub to be effective following the consummation of the merger. However, prior to
the effective time of the merger, Parent or Merger Sub may initiate discussions regarding employment or other
retention terms and may enter into definitive agreements regarding employment or retention for certain of Sumo
Logic’s employees to be effective as of the effective time of the merger.

shares as to which appraisal rights are asserted, all references in Section 262 and in this summary “beneficial owner”
mean a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person, and all references in Section 262 and in this summary to the word “person” mean any individual,

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is available at the following URL, accessible without
s u b s c r i p t i o n  o r  c o s t ,  w h i c h  i s  i n c o r p o r a t e d  h e r e i n  b y  r e f e r e n c e :
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary does not constitute any
legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Sumo Logic’s stockholders exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FULL TEXT OF
SECTION 262 AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED BELOW. 
Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of Sumo Logic common stock or beneficial
owners who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of Sumo Logic common stock to
Sumo Logic prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement; (3) continuously hold of record or beneficially own such shares on the date
of making the demand for appraisal through the effective time of the merger; and (4) otherwise comply with the
procedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of
Sumo Logic common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash, in lieu of
the consideration set forth in the merger agreement, for the “fair value” of their shares of Sumo Logic common stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless
the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger through the
date of payment of the judgment (or in certain circumstances described herein, on the difference between the amount
determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the merger to each person
entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) as described further below. However,
after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons entitled
to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares of a class or series of stock that,
immediately prior to the closing of the merger, were listed on a national securities exchange who are otherwise entitled
to appraisal rights unless (A) the total number of shares of the class or series of stock for which appraisal rights have
been pursued or perfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of such class or series as measured in
accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (B) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares
exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Given that the shares of Sumo Logic
common stock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until closing of the merger),
then the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of Sumo Logic common
stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is satisfied.
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on the
amount determined to be the fair value of the shares subject to appraisal will accrue and compound quarterly from the
effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount
rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before
the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person
entitled to appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount
so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash
payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record
date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or
information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes Sumo Logic’s notice to Sumo Logic’s
stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is
available at the following URL: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with
the merger, any holder of shares of Sumo Logic common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes
to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the
requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the
merger agreement less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising
the right to seek appraisal of shares of Sumo Logic common stock, Sumo Logic believes that if a person is
considering exercising such rights, such person should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Sumo Logic
common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
such person must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
•
such person must deliver to Sumo Logic a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger
agreement at the special meeting;
•
such person must continuously hold of record or beneficially own the shares of Sumo Logic common stock
from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a person will lose appraisal
rights if the person transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger); and
•
such person or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding
a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of
the merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of
doing so).
In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine
persons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who asserted appraisal rights
with respect to the shares of Sumo Logic common stock unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement, each person who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote
against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain.
Filing Written Demand
A person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Sumo Logic, before the vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person’s shares. In addition, that
person must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the internet or
telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any
previously filed written demands for appraisal. A person exercising appraisal rights must hold or own, as applicable,
beneficially or of record, the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold or
own, as applicable, the shares through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not
contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will
constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s and beneficial owner’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously
delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or
abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger
agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of
itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for
appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A
proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A person’s failure to make
the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will
constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a stockholder of record, the demand must reasonably inform
Sumo Logic of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares. In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the demand must
reasonably identify the record holder of the shares for which the demand is made, be accompanied by documentary
evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of such stock and a statement that such documentary
evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which such beneficial owner
consents to receive notices given by the surviving corporation and to be set forth on the verified list (as defined
below).
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
Sumo Logic, Inc.
855 Main Street, Suite 100
Redwood City, California 94063
Attention: Corporate Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and accept
the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to
Sumo Logic, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person without the
approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction (which we refer to
as a “reservation”) for any application (as defined below); provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of
any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time of
the merger. If the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect
to a person, such person will be entitled to receive only the fair value determined in any such appraisal proceeding,
which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered pursuant to the merger
agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify
each stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of each constituent corporation who has properly made a written
demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective time thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any person who
has complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving
corporation in the case of a petition filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving
corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not
assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of
the shares of Sumo Logic common stock. Accordingly, any persons who desire to have their shares appraised should
initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Sumo Logic common stock
within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period
specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for an
appraisal of such person’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement and with respect to which Sumo Logic has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that where a beneficial owner
makes a demand for appraisal directly, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate
stockholder holding such shares for purposes of this aggregate number). Such statement must be given within ten
days after
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration
of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy
thereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such service
to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the “verified list”) containing
the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as
to the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time
and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the persons shown on
the verified list at the addresses stated therein. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.
After notice is provided to the applicable persons as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, at the hearing on
such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with Section 262 and
who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons
who demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by stock certificates to submit their stock
certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any
person fails to comply with this requirement, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
person. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the verified list may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262.
Given that the shares common stock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until
closing of the merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of
shares of Sumo Logic common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership
thresholds is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal and, with respect to Sumo Logic
common stock, that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking
appraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of Sumo Logic common stock, exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be
paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time of the merger through the date of
payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time
of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time
prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to
each person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection
(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount paid
by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery; and (y) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in
an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the
date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair
value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In
Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that]
does
69
TABLE OF CONTENTS
not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising
from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements
of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive
pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm
as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and
may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. ALTHOUGH SUMO LOGIC BELIEVES THAT THE
PER SHARE PRICE IS FAIR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE APPRAISAL OF
FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, AND STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD
RECOGNIZE THAT SUCH AN APPRAISAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF A VALUE HIGHER OR
LOWER THAN, OR THE SAME AS, THE PER SHARE PRICE. Neither Sumo Logic nor Parent anticipates offering
more than the per share price to any persons exercising appraisal rights, and each of Sumo Logic and Parent reserves
the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Sumo Logic common stock is less than the
per share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or, with respect to Sumo Logic common stock, if neither of
the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an
appraisal will cease.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any,
by the surviving corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such person upon such
terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in such Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts)
may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the verified list who
participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith (which we refer to as an “application”),
the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the
shares entitled to an appraisal that were not dismissed pursuant to the terms of Section 262 or subject to an award
pursuant to a reservation. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Sumo Logic common stock under Section 262 fails to
perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of Sumo Logic common
stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share
price as provided in the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such person’s right to
appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares
of Sumo Logic common stock, or if the person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such
person’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in
accordance with Section 262.
From and after the effective time of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with
Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of Sumo Logic common stock for any purpose or to receive payment
of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of
record at a date which is prior to the effective time of the merger); provided, however, that if no petition for an
appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been
satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Sumo Logic common stock, or if
such person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person’s demand for an appraisal and
an acceptance of the merger, within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, then the right of such person to an
appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will
be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon
70
TABLE OF CONTENTS
such terms as the Court deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as
a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger
within 60 days after the effective time of the merger.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of appraisal rights.
In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the
merger agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person wishing to exercise appraisal
rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",75,81

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be
relevant to U.S. holders and Non-U.S. holders of shares of Sumo Logic common stock whose shares are converted
into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court
decisions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”), and other
applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares
of Sumo Logic common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, as
property held for investment purposes). With respect to holders whose shares of Sumo Logic common stock were
subject to vesting restrictions at the time such shares were acquired, if any, this discussion assumes that a valid and
timely election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code was made with respect to such shares.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may
be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
•
tax consequences to holders who received their shares of Sumo Logic common stock in a compensatory
transaction or pursuant to the exercise of Sumo Logic options, or Sumo Logic RSUs, or otherwise in
connection with the performance of services;
•
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.
federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations,
partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders
in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated
investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules;
holders who hold their common stock as “qualified small business stock” for purposes of Sections 1045
and 1202 of the Code, as “Section 1244 stock” within the meaning of Section 1244 of the Code, or through
individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts; Non-U.S. holders that own (directly or by attribution)
more than five percent of Sumo Logic common stock; or U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-
term residents of the United States;
•
tax consequences to holders holding shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle,
or other risk reduction transaction;
•
tax consequences to U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
•
tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other
entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
•
tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
•
tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income
with respect to the shares of Sumo Logic common stock being taken into account in an “applicable
financial statement” (as defined in the Code);
•
any U.S. federal estate, gift, or alternative minimum tax consequences;
71TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
any state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
•
tax consequences to persons that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of
their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Sumo Logic common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner
in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the
partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Sumo Logic common stock and partners therein should consult their tax
advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.
No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger
described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would
ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court. Further, no opinion of counsel has been or will be rendered with
respect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE
U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS
OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.
U.S. Holders
General
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Sumo Logic common stock that is
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) has a valid election
in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.
Taxable Sale of Company Capital Stock
The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Sumo Logic common stock pursuant to the merger will
be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. holder’s gain or loss will be equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.
holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
such U.S. holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A
reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder (including
individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of
shares of Sumo Logic common stock at different times and/or different prices, such holder must determine its
adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Sumo Logic common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders
General
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Sumo Logic common stock
that is neither a U.S. holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
72
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Taxable Sale of Company Capital Stock
Subject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below) withholding, any gain realized
by a Non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained
by such Non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. holder is a corporation,
such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case
such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty); or
•
Sumo Logic is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as “USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five-year
period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares
of Sumo Logic common stock (which we refer to as the “relevant period”) and, if shares of Sumo Logic
common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section
897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five
percent of Sumo Logic common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first
bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if
the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent
of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held
for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land,
improvements and associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we
believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the
merger. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible consequences
to them if we are a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by
a holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. holder that furnishes a
correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS
Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S. holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-
U.S. holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form); or (b)
otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
A U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder’s common stock and file with its U.S. federal
income tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the
merger.
Additional Withholding Requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued
thereunder (which we refer to as, collectively, “FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on
certain payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under these rules) unless such
institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and
provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution
(which include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign
entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30
percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding
73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
agent a certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these
requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.
The U.S. Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would
eliminate the FATCA withholding applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of Sumo Logic
common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may
generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Holders of Sumo Logic common stock are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible
implications of FATCA on the disposition of Sumo Logic common stock pursuant to the merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL
INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL

General Efforts
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and Sumo Logic, on the other hand, agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, do, or cause to be done, all things and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, or causing to be
done, all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the merger, in the most expeditious manner practicable including: (1) seeking to
obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, expirations of all applicable waiting periods, orders and authorizations from
governmental authorities, and taking all actions to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under applicable
law; and (2) making all registrations, declarations, and filings with governmental authorities, in each case that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the merger.
HSR Act; Foreign Direct Investment Laws
Under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period (and extensions thereof, if any)
applicable to the merger under the HSR Act have expired or otherwise been terminated, and all consents of the
relevant governmental authorities under the specified foreign direct investment laws have been obtained or any
applicable waiting period thereunder (including any extensions thereof) shall have expired or been terminated.
Sumo Logic and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the
FTC and the DOJ on February 23, 2023. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern time on March 27, 2023.
In addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with Sumo Logic, submitted the specified foreign direct
investment filings on or prior to March 1, 2023.
Sumo Logic and Parent have each agreed to use its reasonable best efforts, as soon as reasonably practicable, to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act, the specified foreign
direct investment laws, and any other antitrust law or foreign direct investment law applicable to the merger.
Additionally, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed not to acquire or agree to acquire by merging or by acquiring
in any other manner, any business of any person or other business organization or division if such business
competes in any material line of business with Sumo Logic or its subsidiaries and the entering into a definitive
agreement relating to the consummation of such transaction would reasonably be expected to (1) impose any material
delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order,
declaration, or approval of any governmental authority necessary to consummate the merger or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period; (2) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority entering
an order preventing or materially restraining the consummation of the merger; (3) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (4) materially delay or prevent the consummation of
the merger, subject to certain exceptions.
74TABLE OF CONTENTS
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable,
including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or
requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At
any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, any state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action
could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Sumo
Logic or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective controlled
affiliates, if applicable) agreed to, if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR
Act and any other antitrust laws or specified foreign direct investment laws applicable to the merger, promptly take
any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances,
consents, approvals, and waivers under antitrust laws or specified foreign direct investment laws (that may be
required by any governmental authority, so as to enable to parties to consummate the merger as soon as reasonably
practicable); including (1) offering, negotiating, committing to or effecting, by settlement, consent decree, hold
separate order, stipulation, or otherwise (a) the sale, divestiture, license, or other disposition, of any and all of the
capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products
or business of Parent and Merger Sub and their respective controlled affiliates, if applicable, on the one hand, and
Sumo Logic on the other hand; (b) the termination, modification, or assignment of existing relationships, joint
ventures, contracts, or obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, and their respective controlled affiliates, if applicable,
on the one hand, or Sumo Logic and its controlled affiliates on the other hand; (c) committing to behavioral or other
operational conditions and any other modifications of, or restrictions on the businesses, assets, priorities, product
lines, equity interest, or other activities of Parent and Merger Sub and their respective subsidiaries, if applicable, on
the one hand, and Sumo Logic and its controlled affiliates on the other hand; and (2) contesting, defending, and
appealing any pending or threatened legal proceeding challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the
merger and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any order, whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent,
that prohibits, prevents, or restricts the consummation of the merger.
One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement, or limitation when it
grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory
process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even
preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain
all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a
substantial period of time between the approval by Sumo Logic’s stockholders and the completion of the merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, obtained at all, or that the granting of
these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion
of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in
the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment of consideration due to Sumo
Logic’s stockholders, holders of Sumo Logic warrants, and the holders of other equity-based interests under the
merger agreement, will be funded with the proceeds of committed equity financing and Sumo Logic’s cash on hand at
the closing, as further described below.
Pursuant to the equity commitment letter, the Guarantors have committed to capitalize Parent on the closing on the

In connection with entering into the merger agreement, on February 9, 2023, following approval thereof by the Sumo
Logic Board, Sumo Logic’s directors, solely in their capacities as stockholders of Sumo Logic (which we refer to as
the “voting agreement stockholders”), entered into the voting agreements with Parent and Sumo Logic. The voting
agreements cover approximately 2.6 percent of the number of shares of Sumo Logic’s common stock issued and
outstanding as of the record date.
 
75TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the voting agreements, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of Sumo
Logic common stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger and other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and for any proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting
to a later date if Sumo Logic or Parent proposes or requests such postponement or adjournment in accordance with
the merger agreement; and (2) against any action, agreement, or proposal that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the merger agreement.
Pursuant to the voting agreements, the voting agreement stockholders have agreed not to, until the termination of
the voting agreements and subject to certain exceptions in the voting agreements, directly or indirectly (1) offer, sell,
transfer, assign, exchange, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any Sumo Logic common stock or
beneficial ownership, voting power, or any other interest thereof or therein (including by operation of law), or enter
into any contract or other arrangement with respect to the foregoing; (2) deposit any Sumo Logic common stock into
a voting trust or grant any proxies or powers of attorney, or enter into a voting agreement, with respect to any Sumo
Logic common stock that is inconsistent with the voting agreements; or (3) commit or agree to take any of the actions
referred to in the foregoing clauses (1) or (2).
The voting agreement stockholders’ obligations to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement terminate
automatically upon the earliest to occur of (1) the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms; (2) the effective time of the merger agreement; (3) the time that the requisite stockholder approval has been
obtained; or (4) the amendment of any term or provision of the merger agreement that reduces the per share price or
changes the form of consideration payable to the Sumo Logic stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement.",85,86

On March 28, 2023, a purported stockholder of Sumo Logic filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against Sumo Logic and members of the Sumo Logic Board captioned O’Dell v. Sumo
Logic, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-02601-KPF (which we refer to as the “complaint”).
The complaint asserts claims against all defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder, for issuing allegedly false and misleading statements in Sumo Logic’s preliminary proxy
statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on March 24, 2023, and also asserts claims against the individual
defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged “control person” liability with respect to the allegedly
false or misleading statements. The complaint seeks, among other relief, to enjoin defendants from consummating the
merger; if the merger is completed, to rescind the merger agreement or recover damages; an accounting of damages;
and attorneys’ fees and costs.
The defendants believe that the disclosures set forth in the preliminary proxy statement and this definitive proxy
comply fully with applicable law and that the allegations in the complaint are without merit. Additional lawsuits
arising out of the merger may be filed in the future. No assurances can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or
the complaint.

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo Logic to Sumo Logic’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation,”
including the additional disclosures referenced therein that otherwise are disclosed in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
We are asking Sumo Logic’s stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Sumo
Logic to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes and additional disclosures referenced
therein. The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made
generally have previously formed part of Sumo Logic’s overall compensation program for Sumo Logic’s named
executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders in public filings, including Sumo Logic’s
annual proxy statement. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Sumo Logic Board or the
Compensation and Talent Committee of the Sumo Logic Board, which is composed solely of non-employee directors,
and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Sumo Logic approve the compensation that will or may become payable
to Sumo Logic’s named executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger-Interests of Sumo Logic’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” in Sumo Logic’s proxy statement for the special
meeting.”
Sumo Logic’s stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a
non-binding, advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Sumo Logic, the Sumo Logic Board or Parent. Further,
the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder
approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated Sumo Logic’s
named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the
merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.
The Sumo Logic Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

We are asking you to approve any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
special meeting. If stockholders approve this proposal, we can adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned
session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies
from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting against adoption of the merger
agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement. Additionally, we may seek stockholder approval to adjourn the special meeting if a
quorum is not present. Finally, the chairperson of the special meeting is permitted by Sumo Logic’s bylaws to adjourn
the special meeting even if Sumo Logic’s stockholders have not approved the proposal to adjourn the special
meeting.

The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger
agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the merger
agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not
contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the
parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other
information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement
(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations, and
supplemental information agreed to by Sumo Logic, Parent, and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the
terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from
those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by
confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Sumo Logic in connection with the merger agreement.
In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of
allocating contractual risk between Sumo Logic and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as
facts. Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the
circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.
Sumo Logic’s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not
rely on the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations
of the actual state of facts or condition of Sumo Logic, Parent, or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or
businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change
after the date of the merger agreement. Except where expressly provided in the merger agreement, none of the
representations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect
under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants
in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Sumo Logic, Parent, and Merger Sub
because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter
to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given
without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to
provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual
information regarding Sumo Logic, Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the
representations, warranties, covenants, and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone,
and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in Sumo Logic’s filings with the SEC
regarding Sumo Logic and Sumo Logic’s business.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub, and Sumo Logic that is no
later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last condition to the closing of the merger
(other than those conditions that by their term are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the merger agreement) of such conditions); or (2) at such other
time agreed to by Sumo Logic, Parent, and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the merger, the parties will file a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will
become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a later time agreed to in writing by
the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.

and the bylaws of Sumo Logic as the surviving corporation will be amended and restated in their entirety to conform
to the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, in each case, until
thereafter amended.
The parties are obligated to use reasonable best efforts to take all necessary actions so that, at the effective time of

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger,
each share of Sumo Logic common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger (other than the excluded shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the per share price less any applicable withholding taxes (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement).
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock that is (1) held by Sumo Logic as
treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent or Merger Sub will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid in exchange therefor. At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock of Merger
Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into one validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable share of Sumo Logic common stock of the surviving corporation and each certificate
representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares
of common stock of the surviving corporation.
Restricted Stock
Upon the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of
Sumo Logic’s restricted stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger shall vest
in full and be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the per share price less any
applicable withholding taxes.
Treatment of Equity Awards and ESPP
The merger agreement provides that Sumo Logic’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time of the merger:
Treatment of Sumo Logic Restricted Stock Units
At the effective time of the merger each vested Sumo Logic RSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock
subject to such vested Sumo Logic RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Sumo Logic RSU will be cancelled and converted into a converted
cash award (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject to such
81TABLE OF CONTENTS
unvested Sumo Logic RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as
otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be
subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding unvested Sumo Logic RSU
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.
Treatment of Sumo Logic Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
At the effective time of the merger, each vested Sumo Logic PSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock
subject to such vested Sumo Logic PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award
agreement), multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Sumo Logic PSU will be cancelled and converted into a converted
cash award (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject to such
unvested Sumo Logic PSU (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement), multiplied
by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement,
each such converted cash award will be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions (excluding performance-
based vesting conditions) as applied to the corresponding unvested Sumo Logic RSU immediately prior to the

receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock
subject to the vested Sumo Logic option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the exercise
price per share of such vested Sumo Logic option, less applicable withholding taxes.
At the effective time of the merger each unvested Sumo Logic option will be cancelled and converted into a
converted cash award (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock subject
to such unvested Sumo Logic option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share price over the exercise price
per share of such unvested Sumo Logic option, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in
the merger agreement, each such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting
terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding unvested Sumo Logic option immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger.
Any underwater Sumo Logic option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration or
payment.
Treatment of the ESPP
Prior to the effective time of the merger, we will take all actions necessary to, (1) provide that no new individuals will
be permitted to enroll in the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement; (2) make any adjustments that
may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for
all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (3) not allow any increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction
elections under the ESPP during the Current Offering Period from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement;
(4) cause the exercise (as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of
each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP, but otherwise not issue any of Sumo Logic common stock
under the ESPP; (5) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP on
or after the date of the merger agreement; and (6) not extend the current purchase period. Immediately prior to and
effective as of the effective time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), we will terminate the
ESPP and no further rights will be granted or exercised under the ESPP after such termination.
Warrants
At the effective time of the merger, each Sumo Logic warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will be deemed exercised in full as a “cashless exercise” (as described in the Sumo Logic warrants)
effective upon the effective time of the merger, in accordance with the terms of the Sumo Logic warrants. The holder
of such Sumo Logic warrant will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (1) the number of shares

Prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to Sumo Logic, which we refer
to as the “payment agent,” to make payments of the merger consideration to Sumo Logic’s stockholders and
warrantholders. At or prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
payment agent an amount of cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate per share price payable to
Sumo Logic’s stockholders and warrantholders in accordance with the merger agreement.
Promptly (and in any event within one business day) following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the
surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented
outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock (other than excluded shares), a letter of transmittal and instructions
advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for merger consideration. Upon receipt of (1)
surrendered certificates for cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together
with any required bond); and (2) a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
be reasonably requested by the payment agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Sumo Logic common stock represented by such
certificate and (y) the per share price. The amount of any per share price paid to Sumo Logic’s stockholders will not
include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of Sumo Logic common stock held in book-entry form (which
we refer to as “uncertificated shares”) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal
(as both are described above) to the payment agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof. Each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of uncertificated shares that immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of Sumo Logic common stock will, upon
receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form at the effective time of the merger, and any documents as may
reasonably be requested by the payment agent, be entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay and deliver as
promptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Sumo Logic
common stock represented by such holder’s transferred uncertificated shares; and (2) the per share price. The
amount of consideration paid to such Sumo Logic stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any
applicable withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the
merger, such cash will be returned to Parent upon demand, and any of Sumo Logic’s stockholders and warrantholders
as of immediately prior to the merger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement
will thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of payment of the merger consideration (subject to abandoned
property law, escheat law or similar laws). None of the payment agent, Parent, the surviving corporation, or any other
party will be liable to any of Sumo Logic’s stockholders with respect to any cash amounts properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar laws.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has
been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, then the
payment agent will issue the per share price to such holder upon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Parent or the payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of the per share price, require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the
payment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation
or the payment agent with respect to such certificate.

Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) that (A) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead
to a superior proposal; and (B) the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law, Sumo Logic and the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) may,

Until the earlier of the effective time of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement, Sumo Logic has
agreed that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if any acquisition proposal is,
to the knowledge of Sumo Logic, received by Sumo Logic or its representatives, or if any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, Sumo Logic or any of
its representatives, which requests, discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal. Such notice must include (1) the identity of the person or group making such proposal, or
request (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such
person or group that is in effect on the date of the merger agreement); (2) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such proposal or request and, if in writing, a copy thereof; and (3) copies of any material agreements,
documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith. Thereafter, Sumo Logic must keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours of any material development), of the status
and terms of any such proposal and of any such discussions or negotiations, including providing copies of any new
or amended agreements documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “acquisition proposal” means any offer or proposal

thereof) to engage in any acquisition transaction.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “acquisition transaction” means any transaction or

whether from Sumo Logic or any other person, of securities representing more than 15 percent of any class
of equity securities of Sumo Logic after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other
acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or group that, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or group beneficially owning more

any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or group (other than Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their affiliates, or any group that includes Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) of

assets of Sumo Logic and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or

any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
other transaction involving Sumo Logic (or any of its Subsidiaries whose business accounts for more than

whole) pursuant to which (A) any person or group (other than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
affiliates, or any group that includes Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) would hold securities
representing more than 15 percent of any class of equity securities of Sumo Logic (or the surviving
company) outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction; or (B) the stockholders
of Sumo Logic immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85 percent of the total outstanding
equity securities (by vote or economic interests) in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means any written acquisition
proposal on terms that the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) would be more favorable, from a financial point of
view, to Sumo Logic’s stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the merger (taking into account (1) any revisions
to the merger agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination; and (2) those
factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Sumo Logic Board (or any committee thereof), which factors
may include the (a) identity of the person making the proposal; (b) likelihood of consummation in accordance with
the terms of such acquisition proposal; and (c) legal, financial (including the financing terms), regulatory, timing and
other aspects of such acquisition proposal). For purposes of the reference to an “acquisition proposal” in this
definition, all references to “15 percent” in the definition of “acquisition transaction” will be deemed to be references
to “50.1 percent.”

adopt, approve, or recommend an acquisition proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the Sumo Logic Board recommendation within ten business days of the occurrence
of a material event or development and after Parent so requests in writing (or, if the Sumo Logic stockholder

requests in writing) (it being understood that Sumo Logic will not be obligated to affirm the Sumo Logic
Board recommendation on more than two occasions);

Sumo Logic has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance (which we
refer to as the “event notice period”) to the effect that the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) has
(1) so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Sumo Logic Board recommendation change, which notice will
specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Sumo Logic Board recommendation change and will describe
the intervening event in reasonable detail; and
•
prior to effecting such Sumo Logic Board recommendation change, Sumo Logic and its representatives,
until 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the last day of the event notice period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and
its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents so that the Sumo Logic
Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Sumo Logic
Board recommendation change in response to such intervening event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; (2) permitted Parent and its
representatives to make a presentation to the Sumo Logic Board regarding the merger agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); and (3)
following the expiration of the event notice period, the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed
revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents) has
determined that the failure of the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) to make a Sumo Logic Board
recommendation change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law. Each time that material modifications or developments with respect to the
intervening event occur Sumo Logic has agreed to notify Parent of such modification and the event notice
period will recommence and be extended for two business days from the later of (A) the delivery of such
written notice to Parent; or (B) the end of the original event notice period.
At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, if Sumo Logic has received a written acquisition
proposal that the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, then the Sumo Logic Board may (1) effect a Sumo
Logic Board recommendation change with respect to such superior proposal; or (2) authorize Sumo Logic to
terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior
proposal, in each case if and only if:
•
the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Sumo Logic Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
•
Sumo Logic has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the merger agreement with
respect to such acquisition proposal;
•
Sumo Logic has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance (the “notice
period”) to the effect that the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) has (1) received a written
acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2) concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal;
and (3) resolved to effect a Sumo Logic Board recommendation change or to terminate the merger
agreement, which notice describes the basis for such Sumo Logic Board recommendation change or
termination, including the identity of the person or group making such acquisition proposal, and the
material terms of such acquisition proposal will include copies of all relevant documents relating to such
acquisition proposal; and
•
prior to effecting such Sumo Logic Board recommendation change or termination, Sumo Logic and its
representatives, until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the last day of the notice period, have (1) negotiated with
Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transaction documents so that
such acquisition proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal; (2) permitted Parent and its
representatives to make a presentation to the Sumo Logic Board regarding the merger agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being

“notice period” in respect of such new written notice being two business days from the later of (i) the
delivery of such written notice to Parent; or (ii) the end of the original notice period); and (B) at the end of
the notice period, the Sumo Logic Board (or a committee thereof) must have in good faith (after

material consequence of such effect, that (1) as of the date of the merger agreement was not known or reasonably
foreseeable, in each case based on facts known to the Sumo Logic Board as of the date of the merger agreement; and
(2) does not relate to (a) an acquisition proposal; or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that Sumo Logic meets or
exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other
financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the merger agreement, or changes after the
date of the merger agreement in the market price or trading volume of Sumo Logic common stock or the credit rating

From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will honor all of the Sumo Logic benefit
plans made available to Parent in accordance with their terms, except that nothing will prohibit Parent or the surviving
corporation or their affiliates from amending, modifying, or terminating any Sumo Logic benefit plans or
compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or as otherwise required pursuant to
applicable law.
For the benefits period, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will:
•
maintain employee benefits for the benefit of each continuing employee (other than the excluded benefits)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at Sumo Logic or its subsidiaries on the
date of the merger agreement;
•
provide an annual base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and target annual cash bonus or commission
opportunity to each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, is substantially the same in the aggregate
to that provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and in
each case, base compensation and target annual cash incentive or commission compensation opportunities
will not, in the aggregate, be decreased during the benefits period for any continuing employee employed
during that period; and
•
provide to continuing employees with cash severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of
employment (subject to satisfying any requirements required by Parent) that are substantially the same as
those provided by Sumo Logic and its subsidiaries as of the date of the merger agreement under the Sumo
Logic benefit plans listed on the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement.
At or after the effective time of the merger, Parent, and the surviving corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent,
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be granted to the continuing employees credit for all service (1)
with Sumo Logic and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger, and (2) with Parent, the surviving
corporation, and any of their subsidiaries on or after the effective time of the merger, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement (but
not including for any purpose of any excluded benefits), to the same extent such service was credited under the
corresponding Sumo Logic benefit plan in which such continuing employee participated immediately prior to the date
of the merger agreement, except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication
of coverage or benefits or could apply to any defined benefit pension plans.
94TABLE OF CONTENTS
Additionally, Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that:
•
each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in the new
plans sponsored by Parent and its subsidiaries (other than the excluded benefits) to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any new plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable old plan in which such
continuing employee participates immediately before the effective time of the merger;
•
for purposes of new plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any continuing
employee, cause all pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements of such new plan to be waived for such
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents, to the same extent waived under the
corresponding Sumo Logic benefit plan;
•
during the plan year in which the closing of the merger occurs, cause any eligible expenses paid by such
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old plan
ending on the date that such continuing employee’s participation in the corresponding new plan begins to
be given full credit pursuant to such new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new
plan; and
•
any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be credited to such continuing employee following the effective time of the
merger, will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals.

Act and any other antitrust laws or specified foreign direct investment laws applicable to the merger, promptly take
any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances

Additionally, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed not to acquire or agree to acquire by merging or by acquiring
in any other manner, any business of any person or other business organization or division if such business
competes in any material line of business with Sumo Logic or its subsidiaries and the entering into a definitive
agreement relating to the consummation of such transaction would reasonably be expected to (1) impose any material
delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order,
declaration, or approval of any governmental authority necessary to consummate the merger or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period; (2) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority entering
an order preventing or materially restraining the consummation of the merger; (3) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (4) materially delay or prevent the consummation of

Equity Financing and Guaranty
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Guarantors have committed to
capitalize Parent on the closing on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the equity commitment letter.
This amount, together with Sumo Logic’s cash on hand at closing, will be sufficient to fund the aggregate purchase
price and the other payments contemplated by the merger agreement.
Under the merger agreement, Parent agreed to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all
things necessary, proper, and advisable to obtain the equity financing on the terms and conditions described in the
equity commitment letter, including by:
•
maintaining in effect the equity commitment letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof;
•
complying with its obligations under the equity commitment letter;
•
satisfying on a timely basis the conditions to funding the equity financing in the equity commitment letter
that are within Parent and Merger Sub’s control;
•
consummating the equity financing at or prior to the closing, including causing the Guarantors to fund the
equity financing at the closing;
•
complying with its obligations pursuant to the equity commitment letter; and
•
enforcing its rights pursuant to the equity commitment letter.
Under the merger agreement, except as set forth in the equity commitment letter, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
(without the prior written consent of the Company) shall agree to, or permit any amendment, modification,
supplement, or termination of, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the equity commitment letter.
Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to seek to enforce, including by bringing a legal proceeding for specific
performance, the equity commitment letter if Sumo Logic seeks and is granted a decree of specific performance of the
obligation to consummate the merger after all applicable conditions to the granting thereof set forth in the merger
agreement have been satisfied.
Pursuant to the equity commitment letter, certain affiliates of Francisco Partners have agreed to guarantee the due,
punctual, and complete payment of certain of the liabilities and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the merger
agreement plus amounts in respect of certain reimbursement obligations of Parent and Merger Sub for certain costs,
expenses, or losses incurred or sustained by Sumo Logic, as specified in the merger agreement.",105,106

The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to), for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, honor and
fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of Sumo Logic and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements
entered into prior to the effective time of the merger between Sumo Logic and any of its subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director,
officer of Sumo Logic or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger), on the other hand (we refer
to such persons collectively as the “indemnified persons”). In addition, under the merger agreement, during the
period commencing at the effective time of the merger and ending on the sixth anniversary of the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation
96TABLE OF CONTENTS
and its subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, and other similar organizational documents of
the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation, and
the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation, and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of Sumo Logic
and the subsidiaries of Sumo Logic, as applicable, as of the date of the merger agreement. During such six-year period
or such period in which an indemnified person is asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to the merger
agreement, whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended, or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any indemnified persons except as required by applicable law.
Furthermore, during the period commencing at the effective time of the merger and ending on the sixth anniversary of
the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation has agreed to (and Parent has agreed to cause the
surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Sumo Logic’s governing and
organizational documents in effect on the date of the merger agreement or pursuant to any indemnification agreement
with Sumo Logic or any of its subsidiaries in effect as of the effective time of the merger, each indemnified person
from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, to the extent that such legal proceeding arises,
directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as a director, officer, or agent of Sumo Logic or any of its
subsidiaries or other affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred
prior to, at or after the effective time of the merger); and (2) the merger, as well as any actions taken by Sumo Logic,
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the merger (including any disposition of assets of the surviving corporation or
any of its subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries insolvent).
If prior the sixth anniversary of the effective time of the merger, any indemnified person delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to the merger agreement, then the claim asserted in such notice
will survive the sixth-anniversary until such claim is fully and finally resolved.
Prior to the effective time of the merger, Sumo Logic has agreed to purchase a prepaid six-year “tail” policy with
respect to the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. The surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to) maintain the tail policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder for so long as the tail policy is in full force and effect.

The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for Sumo Logic and Parent. Upon valid termination of the
merger agreement under specified circumstances, Sumo Logic agreed to pay Parent (or its designee) a termination fee
of $52.0 million. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable by Sumo Logic to Parent if the merger agreement is
terminated:
•
by Sumo Logic prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Sumo Logic stockholders, in order to enter
into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal; or
•
by Parent if the Sumo Logic Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger.
Sumo Logic also agreed to pay Parent (or its designee) the termination fee in certain circumstances if:
•
the merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination date at a
time when Sumo Logic’s stockholders have not adopted the merger agreement at the special meeting; (2)
because of Sumo Logic’s failure to obtain the required approval of Sumo Logic’s stockholders; or (3)
subject to a 45-day cure period, because Sumo Logic breaches or fails to perform in any material respect
any of its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing
conditions to not be satisfied;

within one year of such termination, Sumo Logic consummates, or enters into a definitive agreement
providing for (and such acquisition proposal is subsequently consummated at any time), a transaction
involving the acquisition of at least 50.1 percent of the outstanding shares of Sumo Logic common stock or
Sumo Logic’s assets.
Sumo Logic is not required to pay the termination fee to Parent on more than one occasion. The merger agreement
also provides that Sumo Logic, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may specifically
enforce the obligations under the merger agreement, except that Sumo Logic may only cause Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the merger, and Parent to cause the equity financing to be funded pursuant to the equity commitment
letter, if certain conditions are satisfied.
Subject to limited exceptions, Parent’s and Merger Sub’s aggregate liability for monetary damages for breaches of the
Merger Agreement are capped at $104.0 million, plus certain reimbursement obligations, and Sumo Logic’s liability for
monetary damages for breaches of the Merger Agreement is capped at $52.0 million, plus any enforcement expenses.
Sumo Logic’s receipt of certain reimbursement obligations payable by Parent to the extent owed, Sumo Logic’s right
to enforce the equity commitment letter with respect thereto and receive certain other amounts under the merger
agreement, and Sumo Logic’s right to specific performance are the sole and exclusive remedies of Sumo Logic and its
affiliates against Parent and its affiliates in respect of the merger agreement, the related transaction documents, the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or such transaction documents, the termination of the merger
agreement or the failure to consummate the merger or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure, and, upon payment of the reimbursement obligations, neither Parent nor any of its
affiliates will have any further liability or obligation to Sumo Logic or any of its affiliates relating to or arising out of
the merger agreement, the related transaction documents, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or
such transaction documents or for any matters forming the basis of such termination, other than in the case of
intentional common law fraud or a willful breach of the merger agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
under no circumstances can Sumo Logic receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to
cause the equity financing to be funded (whether under the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter) and
the occurrence of the closing, on the one hand, and (1) payment of any monetary damages (including any monetary
damages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever; or (2) payment of any of the reimbursement obligations by
Parent to Sumo Logic, on the other hand.

The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of Sumo Logic common stock as of
February 28, 2023 by:
•
each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than five percent of
Sumo Logic common stock;
•
each of Sumo Logic’s named executive officers;
•
each of Sumo Logic’s directors; and
•
all of Sumo Logic’s executive officers and directors as a group.

Logic’s knowledge, the persons or entities identified in the table have sole voting power and sole investment power
with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where

The calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 122,505,306 shares of Sumo Logic common

options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of February 28, 2023, or issuable pursuant to RSUs

computing the percentage ownership of that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the
purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

February 9, 2023
Board of Directors
Sumo Logic, Inc.
305 Main Street
Redwood City, CA 94063
Members of the Board:
We understand that Sumo Logic, Inc. (the “Company”), Serrano Parent, LLC (“Parent”) and Serrano Merger Sub,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
substantially in the form of the draft dated February 9, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other
things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the
Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares of Company Common Stock
that are, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (i) held by the Company as treasury stock, (ii)
owned by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub or (iv) held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor
consented thereto in writing and who have properly demanded appraisal in respect of such shares pursuant to and in
accordance with, Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv),
collectively, the “Excluded Shares”), will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to $12.05, without interest thereon (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set
forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair
from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of
the Company;
2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the
Company;
3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company and certain
extrapolations prepared with guidance from the management of the Company (which were reviewed and
approved by you for our use) (collectively, the “Financial Projections”);
4) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company
with senior executives of the Company;
5) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
6) Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company
Common Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company, and their
securities;
7) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition
transactions;
8) Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and Parent
and their financial and legal advisors;
9) Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft equity commitment letter from Francisco Partners VI, L.P.,
Francisco Partners VI-A, L.P., Francisco Partners VI-B, L.P., Francisco Partners VI-C, L.P. and Francisco Partners
VI-D, L.P. to Parent, substantially in the form of the draft dated February 9, 2023 (the “Equity Commitment
Letter”) and certain related documents; and
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
10) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as
we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a
substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the Financial Projections, we have assumed that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to such Financial
Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or
delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, and that the definitive Merger Agreement and Equity
Commitment Letter will not differ in any material respect from the drafts thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has
assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and
consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that
would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger.
We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without
independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to
legal, tax or regulatory matters. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any
other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or
are available. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any
of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in
the Merger. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor
have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial,
economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof.
Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do
not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Merger and
will receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the
two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financing services to the Company and financial advisory and
financing services for Francisco Partners Management, L.P. (“Francisco Partners”) (which we understand is the
ultimate controlling equity owner of Parent) and certain of its majority-controlled affiliates (collectively, the
“Francisco Partners Related Entities”) and, in each case, have received fees in connection with such services.
Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Company, Parent,
Francisco Partners, the Francisco Partners Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would
expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment
management and individual wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities
underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime
brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its
affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or
short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own
account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Francisco Partners, the Francisco
Partners Related Entities, Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any currency
or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan Stanley,
its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with the Company in connection with the Merger,
may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Francisco Partners or
the Francisco Partners Related Entities or in affiliates of Morgan Stanley that may hold direct equity and/or
partnership interests in private equity funds managed by Francisco Partners or the Francisco Partners Related
Entities.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals
in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the
Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our prior written consent, except that a
copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the Securities

and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law. In
addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the stockholders of the Company
should vote at the stockholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock.

(a) References to this Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) when a
reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, that reference is to an Article,
Section, Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) references to “paragraphs” or “clauses”
are to separate paragraphs or clauses of the Section or subsection in which the reference occurs. References to
this Agreement (in this Agreement or any Transaction Document) mean this Agreement as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with Section 9.3.
(b) Hereof, Including, etc. When used in this Agreement, (i) the words “hereof,” “herein” and “herewith”
and words of similar import will, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (ii) the phrase “the date hereof” means “the date of this
Agreement;” and (iii) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words “without limitation.”
(c) Threats. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, the word “threat” or “threatened” will
be deemed to be immediately followed by the words “in writing.”
A-14TABLE OF CONTENTS
(d) Neither, etc. Not Exclusive. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, “neither,” “nor,”
“any,” “either” and “or” are not exclusive. The rule known as the ejusdem generis rule will not apply, and
accordingly, general words introduced by the word “other” will not be given a restrictive meaning by reason of
the fact that they are preceded by words indicating a particular class of acts, matters or things.
(e) Extent. The phrase “to the extent” means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and does
not simply mean “if.”
(f) Dollars. When used in this Agreement, references to “$” or “Dollars” are references to United States
dollars. All amounts in this Agreement will be paid in Dollars, and if any amounts, costs, fees or expenses
incurred by any Party pursuant to this Agreement are denominated in a currency other than Dollars, to the
extent applicable, the Dollar equivalent for such costs, fees and expenses will be determined by converting such
other currency to Dollars at the foreign exchange rates published by Bloomberg or, if not reported thereby,
another authoritative source reasonably determined by the Company, in effect at the time that such amount,
cost, fee or expense is incurred. If the resulting conversion yields a number that extends beyond two decimal
points, it will be rounded to the nearest penny.
(g) Meaning of Terms. The meaning assigned to each capitalized term defined and used in this Agreement
is equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term, and words denoting any gender
include all genders. Where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement, each of its other grammatical forms
has a corresponding meaning. All terms defined in this Agreement will have the defined meanings when used in
any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant to this Agreement unless otherwise defined in
such certificate or document. References to the “United States” or abbreviations thereof mean the United States
of America and its states, territories and possessions.
(h) References to Persons. References to any Person (including any Party) include references to such
Person’s successors and permitted assigns, and, in the case of any Governmental Authority, to any Person
succeeding to its functions and capacities. It is agreed that a breach of this Agreement by Merger Sub will be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent.
(i) References to Subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Agreement to the
Subsidiaries of a Person will be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person.
(j) Writings. References to “writing” mean the representation or reproduction of words, symbols or other
information in a visible form by any method or combination of methods, whether in electronic form or otherwise,
and including writings delivered by Electronic Delivery. “Written” will be construed in the same manner.
(k) Legislation; Contracts. A reference to any specific legislation or to any provision of any legislation
includes any amendment to, and any modification, re-enactment or successor thereof, any legislative provision
substituted therefor and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto,
except that, for purposes of any representations and warranties in this Agreement that are made as a specific
date, references to any specific legislation will be deemed to refer to such legislation or provision (and all rules,
regulations, statutory instruments and applicable guidance, guidelines, bulletins or policies issued or made in
connection therewith by a Governmental Authority) as of such date. References to any agreement or Contract
are to that agreement or Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, and any exhibits,
schedules, annexes, statements of work, riders and other documents attached thereto, provided that with
respect to the Contracts, and any amendments, exhibits, schedules, annexes, statements of work, riders and
other documents attached thereto scheduled in the Company Disclosure Letter, solely to the extent made
available to Parent prior to the date hereof.
(l) Accounting Matters. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all accounting terms used in this
Agreement will be interpreted, and all accounting determinations hereunder will be made, in accordance with
GAAP. An item arising with respect to a specific representation or warranty will be deemed to be “reflected on”
or “set forth in” a balance sheet or financial statements, to the extent that any such phrase appears in such
representation or warranty, if (i) there is a reserve, accrual or other similar item underlying a number on such
balance sheet or financial statements that is related to the subject matter of such representation; (ii) such item is
otherwise specifically set forth on the balance sheet or financial statements; or (iii) such item is specifically set
forth on the balance sheet or financial statements and is specifically set forth in the notes thereto.

(m) Headings. The table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference purposes only and will not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement or any term or provision of this Agreement.
(n) Applicable Time. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to a specific time are to the then-applicable
local time in San Francisco, California.
(o) Calculation of Time Periods. Unless otherwise indicated, (i) when calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date
that is the reference date in calculating such period will be excluded; (ii) if the last day of such period is not a
Business Day, then the period in question will end on the next Business Day; (iii) if any action (other than any
action described in Section 5.4) must be taken on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such action may
be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day; (iv) the measure of a period of one month or year
for purposes of this Agreement will be the day of the following month or year corresponding to the starting
date; and (v) if no corresponding date exists, then the end date of such period being measured will be the next
actual day of the following month or year (for example, one month following February 18 is March 18 and one
month following March 31 is May 1). References to “from” or “through” any date mean, unless otherwise
specified, from and including or through and including such date, respectively.
(p) Nature of Days and Months. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, that number will
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Any reference to a “month” means a calendar month.
(q) Representations Are Not Covenants. Nothing contained in Article III or Article IV may be construed as
a covenant under the terms of this Agreement, other than the acknowledgments and agreements set forth in
Section 3.28 and Section 4.13 to the extent necessary to give full effect to the acknowledgments and agreements
set forth therein.
(r) Joint Drafting. The Parties agree that they have been represented by legal counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement. Accordingly, the Parties irrevocably waive the application of any
Law, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
(s) Summaries. No summary of this Agreement or any Exhibit, Schedule or other document delivered with
this Agreement that is prepared by or on behalf of any Party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or such Exhibit, Schedule or document.
(t) No Admission. The information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Letters is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained in this Agreement or in the Disclosure
Letters will be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third Person of any matter whatsoever, including
(i) any violation of Law or breach of contract; or (ii) that such information is material or is required to be referred
to or disclosed under this Agreement. Disclosure of any information or document in the Disclosure Letters is
not a statement or admission that it is material or required to be disclosed in the Disclosure Letters. Nothing in
the Disclosure Letters constitutes an admission against the applicable Party’s interest or represents the
applicable Party’s legal position or legal rights on the matter so disclosed. No reference in this Agreement to
dollar amount thresholds will be deemed to be evidence of a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or materiality.
(u) Nature of Information Disclosed. It is understood and agreed that (i) the specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement is not intended to imply that such
amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material; and (ii) the inclusion of any specific item in the
Disclosure Letters is not intended to imply that such items are or are not material or are within or outside of the
ordinary course of business. In each case, no Party may use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact
of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Letters in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement or whether any obligation, item or matter included in the Disclosure Letters is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement or is within or outside of the ordinary course of business.
(v) No Reliance by Others on Representations. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 9.4 without
notice

or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely on the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or
as of any other date.
(w) Made Available. The phrases “furnished,” “provided,” “delivered” or “made available” or words of
similar import when used with respect to documents or other information means that such documents or
information have been physically or electronically delivered to the relevant Party prior to the date of this

or the holders of any of the following securities, the following will occur:
(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and each
certificate representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent
ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “Owned Company Shares”)

in exchange therefor; and
(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares, if any) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $12.05, without interest
thereon (the “Per Share Price”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10 (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.12).

subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (“Company Restricted Stock”) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Price pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(iii).
A-18TABLE OF CONTENTS
(c) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock distribution or dividend (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common
Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.
(d) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.

shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder, or owned by a Person, who has (A) neither voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or the Merger nor consented to the Merger in writing and (B) properly demanded appraisal of
such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 262 of the DGCL
(such shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7 but instead, such
holders or other applicable Persons holding or owning the Dissenting Company Shares will be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Such holder or other applicable Person will be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. However, if, after the Effective Time, such holder or other
applicable Person fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or waives, or otherwise loses such Person’s right to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such Person is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
such shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price in accordance with this
Agreement and will not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Company Shares.
(ii) Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal. The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of any Dissenting
Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of any Dissenting Company Shares. The
Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of
any Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section 2.7(d)(ii), “participate” means that Parent
will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands for
appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of any Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected)
and may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands, but Parent will not be afforded any
decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment, settlement or
compromise consent set forth above.",140,141

required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8,
each such Converted Cash Award assumed and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8 will continue to
have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including acceleration provisions
upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding Unvested Company
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that terms rendered inoperable by the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents will no longer have any force or effect. Following the
Effective Time, no such Unvested Company RSU that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of an Unvested Company RSU shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except for the right (if any) to receive a Converted Cash Award in exchange
for such Unvested Company RSU in accordance with this Section 2.8(a)(ii). Any such conversion and
assumption will be effected in a manner that complies with, or is exempt from, the requirements of Code
Section 409A.
(b) Company PSUs.
(i) Vested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award granted pursuant to
a Company Equity Plan that is subject to any performance-based vesting conditions (a “Company PSU”)
and that is outstanding and fully vested (but not yet settled) at the Effective Time (a “Vested Company
PSU”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (x) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time (as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement) multiplied by (y) the
Per Share Price, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (the “Vested
Company PSU Consideration”).
(ii) Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company PSU granted
pursuant to a Company Equity Plan that is not a Vested Company PSU (an “Unvested Company PSU”) will,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted
into a Converted Cash Award with respect to an aggregate amount in cash (without interest) equal to (x)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company PSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement)
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Price, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8, each such Converted Cash Award assumed and
converted pursuant to this Section 2.8 will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including time-
based vesting conditions, but excluding performance-based vesting conditions and including acceleration
provisions upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding
Unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Company Options.
(i) Vested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option that is vested
at the Effective Time, or that vests as a result of the consummation of transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (each, a “Vested Company Option”), will, automatically and without any required action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted solely into the right to receive an amount (without
interest) in cash, equal in value to (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Vested Company Option multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Company Option, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment (the “Vested Company Option Consideration”). For
the avoidance of doubt, any Vested Company Option that has an exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Price will be cancelled at the Effective Time for
no consideration or payment and without further action on the part of any Person.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Following the Effective Time, no Vested Company Option shall remain outstanding, and each former holder
of a Vested Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right (if any)
to receive the Vested Company Option Consideration in exchange for such Vested Company Option in
accordance with this Section 2.8(c)(i).
(ii) Unvested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option that is not
a Vested Company Option (each, an “Unvested Company Option”) will, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted solely into the contingent
right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation a Converted Cash Award equal in value to (A) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock under such Unvested Company Option, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8,
each such Converted Cash Award assumed and converted pursuant to this Section 2.8 will continue to
have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including acceleration provisions
upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the corresponding Unvested Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any Unvested Company Option
that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Per
Share Price will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment and without further
action on the part of any Person. Following the Effective Time, no Unvested Company Option shall remain
outstanding, and each former holder of an Unvested Company Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except for the right (if any) to receive the Converted Cash Award in exchange for such
Unvested Company Option in accordance with this Section 2.8(c)(ii). Any such conversion and
assumption will be effected in a manner that complies with, or is exempt from, the requirements of Code
Section 409A.
(iii) Exercise Blackout. On or as promptly as practicable following (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days of) the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to take all action that is reasonably necessary (a) to provide that any Unvested Company Option
not be subject to “early exercise” pursuant to the terms thereof, and (b) to prohibit the holder thereof from
effecting any “early exercise” of such holder’s Unvested Company Options, in each case, from and
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.
(d) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Vested Company RSU
Consideration owed to all holders of Vested Company RSUs, (ii) Vested Company PSU Consideration owed to all
holders of Vested Company PSUs, and (iii) Vested Company Option Consideration owed to all holders of Vested
Company Options. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than
the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the Closing Date, the applicable former holders of Vested
Company Options, Vested Company PSUs and Vested Company RSUs will receive a payment from the Surviving
Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, of the Vested Company Option Consideration,
Vested Company PSU Consideration and Vested Company RSU Consideration required to be paid to such former
holders pursuant to this Section 2.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Vested
Company RSUs, Vested Company PSUs or Vested Company Options pursuant to this Section 2.8 cannot be
made through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation
will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation will pay any portion
of a Converted Cash Award that vests to the applicable holder thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but no
later than the next regularly scheduled payroll cycle following the date on which such portion vests (but in no
event later than December 31 of the year in which the Converted Cash Award vested).
(e) Necessary Further Actions. The Company will take all action within its power and authority reasonably
necessary to effect the cancellation, conversion and/or assumption (as the case may be) of Company Equity-
Based Awards as of the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the
requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). Subject to obtaining any required consents
from the holders thereof, all Company Equity-Based Awards and all Company Equity Plans will terminate as of
the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger).

(f) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all
actions necessary to, (A) provide that no new individuals will be permitted to enroll in the ESPP on or following
the date of this Agreement; (B) make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the
shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase
period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the
ESPP; (C) not allow any increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP
during the offering period or purchase period that is in effect on the date of this Agreement (the “Current
Purchase Period”) from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (D) cause the exercise (as of no later than
one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right
pursuant to the ESPP, but otherwise not issue any Company Common Stock under the ESPP; (E) provide that no
further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP on or after the date of this
Agreement; and (F) not extend the Current Purchase Period. If purchase rights are exercised under the ESPP
pursuant to the foregoing prior to the Closing Date, on such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds
credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of
the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP and no
further rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

(a) Warrants. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective
Time each Company Warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be deemed
exercised in full as a “cashless exercise” (as described in the Company Warrant) effective upon the Effective
Time, in accordance with the terms of the Company Warrant, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Per Share Price by (ii)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock deemed to be issuable upon exercise in full of the Company
Warrant as a “cashless exercise,” calculated in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of such
Company Warrant (the “Company Warrant Consideration”).

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter
into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such
Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and holders of Company Warrants pursuant to Section 2.7 and Section 2.9,
respectively, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company
Common Stock and holders of Company Warrants become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 and Section 2.9,
respectively. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be
invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully
guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or
better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available)
(such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with
respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all
or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
A-22TABLE OF CONTENTS
that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any interest or other income from
investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.
(i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within one Business
Day), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record
(as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and
Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.12)); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon
surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in
Section 2.12) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be
entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will
cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an amount in
cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
by (2) the Per Share Price. The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may
impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of Certificates on the amount payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.10(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will
be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an
“agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be
deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” or such
other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to
receive (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount
in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s
transferred Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share Price. The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will
be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof
in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any
holder of Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this Section 2.10(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish
procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30
a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on
A-23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after
11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or
its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.7 may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or
transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has
paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction
of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not
payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the
Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.
(f) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment
Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which
any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the
Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore surrendered
or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock
for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.10 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for
any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.
2.11 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares",144,146
"Sumo Logic, Inc._20230405_DEFM14A_20779809_4641204.Pdf",No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock,"No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares
of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and
(b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously representing any shares of Company Common
Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration payable therefor
in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(d)).
The consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company
Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange
procedures of Section 2.10(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent
may, in its

discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that

to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

therefrom pursuant to any applicable Laws related to Taxes. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all

residence is based outside of the United States (the “International Employee Plans”), to the extent applicable,

sponsor, plan administrator or any fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan with respect to the administration or
operation of such plans, other than routine claims for benefits that have been or are being handled through an
administrative claims procedure, and there is no fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any such Legal Proceeding.

been no breaches of fiduciary duty (as determined under ERISA) nor any non-exempt “prohibited transactions”
(as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could reasonably be expected to result in
the imposition of a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed by Section 4975 of
the Code, in each case applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Benefit Plan, or for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnification obligation.
(f) No Welfare Benefit Plan. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no Company

or together with any other event) that, individually or in the aggregate, could be characterized as a “parachute
payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
(i) Section 409A. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Benefit
Plan that constitutes in any part a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” (within the meaning of Section

pursuant to an exemption from, Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder and no amount
under any such Company Benefit Plan is, or is reasonably expected to be, or has been subject to the interest or
additional Tax set forth under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have
any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual with respect to any Tax, including
under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.
(j) International Employee Plans. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each
International Employee Plan has been established, maintained, funded, operated, and administered in

not be fully accrued for in its financial statements or fully offset by insurance with respect to any “defined
benefit plan” (as defined in ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA), seniority premium, termination indemnity,

true, correct and complete copy of the Equity Commitment Letter, pursuant to which the Guarantors have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the cash
amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding all amounts payable by Parent and/or Merger Sub under
this Agreement at the Closing in connection with the Merger and the transactions pursuant thereto (the “Equity
Financing”) and guaranteed the payment of all amounts payable by Parent hereunder. The Equity Commitment
Letter provides that (i) the Company is an express third party beneficiary thereof in connection with the

arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to the funding, investing or use, as applicable, of

amount of the Equity Financing, impose additional conditions precedent or that would otherwise materially
affect the availability of the Equity Financing on the Closing Date.
(c) Sufficiency of Financing. The aggregate amounts committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter
are sufficient to (i) satisfy all payment obligations of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement in

(a) No Solicitation. Subject to Section 5.4(b), following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its executive officers and directors, and will instruct its legal
and financial advisors and use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its Representatives (other than its non-
controlled Affiliates that are not directors, officers or employees of the Company) to, cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room access (or other access to
diligence) of, any Person and its Representatives relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Transaction. Unless the Company has already so requested, promptly following the date of this
Agreement, the Company will request that each Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) that has
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Transaction
promptly return or destroy, in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, all non-public
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this
Agreement. Subject to Section 5.4(b), during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their
respective directors and executive officers, will not, and the Company will not authorize or direct any of its or its
Subsidiaries’ other employees, consultants or other Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any
proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to any
Person or Group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives) any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person or Group (other than

books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in any such case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or the
making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) knowingly
participate, facilitate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person or Group with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to the making of an Acquisition
Proposal, other than informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 5.4, or discussing any

Group, solely to the extent necessary to clarify the terms of the Acquisition Proposal; (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v)
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than, in each case, an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement
or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”); or (vi)
authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. Following the date of this Agreement, the Company will not be
required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any “standstill” provision in any Contract to the extent that
such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) if the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.
(b) Permitted Conduct Related to Certain Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.4, from the date of this Agreement until the Company’s receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of
their respective Representatives (including the Company Financial Advisor), (i) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with; (ii) subject to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (1) furnish any non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to; or (2) afford access to the business,

properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to; or (iii) otherwise facilitate the making of a Superior Proposal by, in each case, any Person
or Group or their respective Representatives that has made, renewed or delivered to the Company an
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that was not solicited in material breach of Section 5.4(a).
The Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may only take the actions contemplated by the

consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take
the actions contemplated by this Section 5.4(b) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law.

Except as provided by Section 5.4(d), at no time after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a
committee thereof):
(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent (it being
understood that it shall be considered a modification adverse to Parent if (1) any Acquisition Proposal
structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced and the Company Board fails to publicly recommend
against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders within 10 Business
Days of commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act; or (2) any Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced (other than by the commencement of a tender or exchange offer) and the
Company Board fails to issue a public press release within 10 Business Days of such public announcement
providing that the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation); (B) adopt, approve or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within 10 Business Days of the occurrence of a material event or development and after Parent so requests

not be obligated to affirm the Company Board Recommendation on more than two occasions (other than as
contemplated in clause (2) above)); (D) make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange
offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or the issuance of a “stop, look and listen”
communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th Business Day after the
commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such
action being considered a violation of this Section 5.4); or (E) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a “Company
Board Recommendation Change”), it being understood that none of (1) the determination in itself by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
lead to, a Superior Proposal; (2) the delivery, in itself, by the Company to Parent or its Representatives of
any notice contemplated by Section 5.4(d); or (3) the public disclosure, in itself, of the items in clauses (1)
and (2) if required by applicable Law will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate
this Section 5.4; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(d) Permissible Company Board Recommendation Change and Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, other than in connection with a written
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if and only if:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
(2) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days (the
“Event Notice Period”) in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
(A) so determined and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to
this Section 5.4(d)(i), which notice will specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Company Board
Recommendation Change and will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
(3) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, until 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, at the end of such four (4) Business Day period, have
(A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents so that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in
good faith that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable Law; (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the
Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent
that Parent requests to make such a presentation); and (C) following such Event Notice Period, the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents) has determined that the failure of the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) to make a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; it being understood
that each time that material modifications or developments with respect to the Intervening Event occur
(as reasonably determined by the Company Board in good faith), the Company shall notify Parent of
such modification and the time period set forth in the preceding clause (2) shall recommence and be
extended for two Business Days from the later of (i) the delivery of such written notice to Parent or (ii)
the end of the original Notice Period.
(ii) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company
Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal
or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:

its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.4 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
(3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in

received a written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), which notice will describe the basis
for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person
or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and
will include copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and
(4) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company
and its Representatives, until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the last day of the Notice Period, have (A)
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests
A-48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company
Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent
requests to make such a presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any material
revision, amendment, update or supplement to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.4(d)(ii)(4) with respect to such new written notice (with the “Notice Period” in respect of such new
written notice being two Business Days from the later of (i) the delivery of such written notice to
Parent or (ii) the end of the original Notice Period); and (b) at the end of the Notice Period, the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) must have in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents) reaffirmed its determination
described in clause (1) above that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.
(e) Notice to Parent of Acquisition Proposals. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly
(and, in any event within 48 hours from the receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing if an Acquisition Proposal is,
to the Knowledge of the Company (which, for this purpose, will be deemed to include each member of the
Company Board and will not be deemed to be only as of the date of this Agreement), received by the Company
or its Representatives or any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives, which requests,
discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice must
include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal or request (unless such disclosure is
prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group that is in effect on
the date of this Agreement); (B) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such proposal or request
and, if in writing, a copy thereof; and (C) copies of any material agreements, documents or other written
materials submitted in connection therewith. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on
a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours of any material development with regard to or material
amendment of such proposal or request), of the status and terms of any such proposal (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including providing copies of any
new or amended material agreements, documents or other written materials submitted in connection therewith.
During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) make available to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such
Person or Group or its Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent or its Representatives.
(f) Permitted Disclosures by the Company and the Company Board. So long as the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such public disclosure (other
than in a customary “stop, look and listen” communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act):
(i) nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-
2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange

required by applicable Law, it being understood that (1) any such statement or disclosure made by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) pursuant to this Section 5.4(f)(i) must be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise adversely affect the obligations of the
Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.4;
and (2) nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with
Section 5.4(d); and

statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that solely (A) describes the
Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; (B) identifies the Person or Group making such Acquisition
Proposal; (C) provides the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal; or (D) describes the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in any case, be deemed to be (1) a withholding, withdrawal,
amendment, qualification or modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption,
approval or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a Company Board
Recommendation Change.
(g) Breach of No-Solicitation Obligations by Representatives of the Company. The Company agrees that if
it (i) affirmatively permits any of its Representatives (other than its non-controlled Affiliates that are not
directors, officers or employees of the Company) to take any action or (ii) is made aware of an action by one of
its Representatives (other than its non-controlled Affiliates that are not directors, officers or employees of the
Company) and does not use its reasonable best efforts to prohibit or terminate such action and, in each case,
such action would constitute a material breach of this Section 5.4 if taken by the Company during the Pre-
Closing Period, then such action will be deemed to constitute a breach by the Company of this Section 5.4.",168,172

of the Merger; or (ii) ability of such Party to fully perform its covenants pursuant to this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub taken (or failed to be taken) in compliance
with the express terms of this Agreement will be considered a violation of this Section 6.1.
(c) No Consent Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.1 or elsewhere in
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to agree to the payment of a

Laws. Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, including their “ultimate parent entity” as
that term is defined in the HSR Act and its implementing regulations (“UPE”), if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company (and its Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, will use (and will cause its respective

Investment Laws, or any other Antitrust Laws or Foreign Direct Investment Law applicable to the Merger, then
such Party will use reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response to such request, and cooperate and coordinate
with the other Parties in connection with responding to any such request. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company
will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not to, (a) “pull-and-refile” pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 or
otherwise withdraw any filing under the HSR Act, the Specified Foreign Direct Investment Laws, or any other

Agreement, Parent shall, following consultation with the Company and considering in good faith the Company’s
views, control all aspects of the parties’ efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, including clearances under any
Antitrust Laws or Foreign Direct Investment Laws.
(b) Efforts to Cause the Closing. In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 6.2(a), if and to the extent
necessary to obtain clearance of the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act, the Specified Foreign Direct Investment
Laws, and any other Antitrust Laws or Foreign Direct Investment Laws applicable to the Merger, each of Parent

respective controlled Affiliates, as applicable, to) take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate
or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under
Antitrust Laws or Foreign Direct Investment Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority, so as
Antitrust Laws or Foreign Direct Investment Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority, so as

than five Business Days prior to the Termination Date), including (i) offering, negotiating, committing to or
effecting, by settlement, consent decree, hold separate order, stipulation or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether
tangible or intangible), rights, properties, products or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective

terminating, modifying, or assigning existing relationships, joint ventures, Contracts, or obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub (and their respective controlled Affiliates, if applicable) on the one hand, or the Company and
its controlled Affiliates on the other hand; and (C) committing to behavioral or other operational conditions and
any other modifications of, or restrictions on the businesses, assets, properties, product lines, equity interests,
or other activities of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Subsidiaries, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company and its controlled Affiliates, on the other hand; and (ii) contesting, defending and appealing
any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding challenging or in respect of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the Merger prior to the Termination Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to enter into any agreement or consent decree with the DOJ, FTC or any other Governmental

this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this

information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (including information regarding the business,

of business, as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist in the preparation of a customary quality

information documents used in financings associated with leveraged buyouts of comparable sized
companies (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not include any Excluded Information);

customary payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the Closing, and

in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, cause competitive harm to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, it being understood that, in each case the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information or documents, and use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements to permit the disclosure of such information without implicating the
foregoing restrictions. In addition, (A) no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument relating to the Debt Financing will be effective until the Effective Time; (B) neither the Company nor

Subsidiaries to provide any information (a) the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable

product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such information; or (ii) violate or cause a default pursuant to,
or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate its rights pursuant to, any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound. The Company will be deemed to be in
compliance with Section 6.6(a) at all times unless and until (A) Parent provides written notice (the “Non-
Cooperation Notice”) to the Company of any alleged failure to comply, or action or failure to act, that constitutes
a breach of Section 6.6(a); (B) Parent includes in such Non-Cooperation Notice reasonable detail regarding the

Merger; and (iii) in a manner consistent with the other terms and conditions that the Company reasonably
imposes in writing to Parent.

Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information to any Debt Financing Sources or prospective equity or debt financing sources and other
financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Financing and to any underwriters,
initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their

respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality
Agreement as a “Representative” thereunder as if parties thereto; or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality
undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives in connection with its ordinary course financial

by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives in the ordinary course of business notwithstanding this
Section 6.6).

and held harmless by Parent from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees), interest, awards, judgments,

arranging or obtaining the Debt Financing (including any cooperation pursuant to Section 6.6(a)) pursuant to
this Agreement or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith, except with respect to any
losses suffered or incurred as a result of (i) the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company

Obligations.”

each cause their respective Representatives (which for this purpose will be deemed to include the Debt
Financing Sources, the Guarantors and each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub (pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter or otherwise) or any other potential financing sources of Parent, Merger Sub and such
investors not to)) enter into any Contract prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other
potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial advisory
services to any Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or in connection with the Merger.
(h) No Financing Condition. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Debt
Financing is not a condition to the Closing. If any Debt Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger
Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII, to consummate the Merger.

(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to), for a period of six years after the Effective Time, honor and fulfill,
in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements
between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former
directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) set forth on Section 6.10
of the Company Disclosure Letter or that use the same form, in all material respects, as the form of
indemnification agreement filed with the Company SEC Reports. In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates
of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries
of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period or such period in
which an Indemnified Person is asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.10(b), whichever is
longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a), during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by the governing and organizational documents of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect
as of the Effective Time and set forth on Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter or that use the same
form in all material respects as the form of indemnification agreement filed with the Company SEC Reports, each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that
such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, or agent of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action
A-59TABLE OF CONTENTS
or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger,
as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any
disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will
survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In connection
with a Legal Proceeding of the type contemplated by this Section 6.10(b), (A) the Surviving Corporation will
have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to
control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Person’s entitlement to indemnification under this Section 6.10 with respect thereto); (B) each
Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid
by the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any
such Legal Proceeding; (C) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay
any amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the
Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as
incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be
liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such
settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
Legal Proceeding. No Indemnified Person shall compromise, settle or consent to an arrangement regarding, or
agree to compromise, settle or consent to an arrangement regarding, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification is or will be sought under this Section 6.10(b) unless Parent has consented thereto in writing
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not have any liability for any such compromise, settlement or arrangement effected without
Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or
complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of
which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid six-year “tail” policy
(the “Tail Policy”) with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the total cost for the
Tail Policy does not exceed 400 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal
year, it being understood that if the aggregate cost would exceed that limit, the Company shall purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable up to such limit. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder for so long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. Proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10 if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person.
(e) No Impairment; Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not
be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or
any other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance
or the Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of
the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries

pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10,
with full rights of enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and his or her heirs
and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to this
Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
or (iv) applicable Law.
(f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.10 are joint and several.
(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair
any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to
such policies or agreements.",181,183

(a) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans made available to Parent in
accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates from amending, modifying, or terminating any Company Benefit Plans or
compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or as otherwise required pursuant to
applicable Law.
(b) Employment; Benefits. For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the one-year
anniversary thereof, or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the Continuing Employee (the “Benefits
Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) (i) maintain employee benefits for the benefit of each Continuing Employee (other than
defined benefit pension, retiree welfare, and the opportunity to participate in equity or equity-based or other
long term incentive compensation, change of control, retention, transaction bonus or similar arrangements,
defined benefit pension, retiree or post-employment welfare or nonqualified deferred compensation (collectively,
the “Excluded Benefits”)) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company
or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement; and (ii) provide an annual base salary or wage rate, as
applicable, and target annual cash bonus or commission opportunity to each Continuing Employee that, taken
as a whole, is substantially the same in the aggregate to that provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and target annual cash incentive or
commission compensation opportunities will not, in the aggregate, be decreased during the Benefits Period for
any Continuing Employee employed during that period. During the Benefits Period, the Surviving Corporation
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide to Continuing Employees with cash severance
benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment (and subject to satisfying any requirements required by
Parent) that are substantially the same as those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement under the Company Benefit Plans listed on Section 3.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(c) New Plans. At or after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any
other Subsidiary of Parent to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be granted to the Continuing
Employees credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement, but not including for any purposes of any Excluded Benefits, to the same extent such service was
credited under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the date hereof, except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits or could apply to any defined benefit pension plans. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any
other Subsidiary of Parent to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Continuing Employee
will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans
A-61TABLE OF CONTENTS
sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded Benefits) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to
the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
the “Old Plans”); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision
benefits to any Continuing Employee, cause all pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination
requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the same extent waived under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan, and, during the plan year in which the Closing occurs, cause any eligible
expenses paid by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New
Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, will not be subject to
accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals.
(d) No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, neither this Section 6.11 nor any provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time (or any particular term of employment), or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee or other
Person for any or no reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to maintain or continue any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy
agreement or arrangement or prevent the amendment, modification, suspension or termination thereof after the
Effective Time; (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) be treated as an amendment of,

(a) Manner of Termination. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 (other than
pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in
reasonable detail the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated and the
facts and circumstances forming the basis for such termination.
(b) Effect of Termination. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective
immediately upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by
the terminating Party to the other Parties, as applicable. Following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any direct or
indirect equity holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, agent or other Representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as applicable, except, and subject in

Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the
Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be responsible for
all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.10(e), Parent will pay or cause to be
paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other
similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger.
(b) Company Payments.
(i) Future Transactions. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c) by
Parent at a time when the Requisite Stockholder Approval has not been obtained, Section 8.1(d) or Section
8.1(e); (B) at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b), and Section 7.1(c) have
been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section
7.3(b) would be satisfied if the date of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c),
Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly
disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (D) within one year of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as applicable, either an Acquisition
Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the
consummation of an Acquisition Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently
consummated at any time, then the Company will, concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition
Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to the Company Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(a) (which
Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references
to “15 percent” or “85 percent” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be
references to “50.1 percent.”
A-68TABLE OF CONTENTS
(ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then the Company must, within two Business Days following such termination, pay or cause
to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(a) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to
time).
(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the
Company must, concurrently with such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time).
(c) Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will
the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the
Company Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same
or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the
Company Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Company Termination Fee, if, as and
when required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.
(d) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(a)
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against
the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(a) then the Company will pay or cause to be paid to the
other party the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys’ fees) of Parent in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such
amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal (or
other authoritative source to the extent no such figure is published by The Wall Street Journal) on the date that
such payment or portion thereof was required to be made) plus five percent through the date that such payment
or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law
(collectively, “Enforcement Expenses”).
(e) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) For the Company Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
(A) the Company’s receipt of the Reimbursement Obligations and the Company’s right to specific
performance pursuant to Section 9.10(b) (solely with respect to specifically enforcing its rights under
Section 8.2 and this Section 8.3) and the Company’s rights under the Equity Commitment Letter will be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties in respect of
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the Merger or any
claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and, (B) upon
payment of the Reimbursement Obligations, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability
or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, or for any matters forming the basis of such termination, except that, in each case

and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2
and Section 8.3(a), as applicable; and (y) the Guarantors will remain obligated, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Equity Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 8.3(e)(i) will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors from any liability
(1) for any intentional common law fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, except that under no
circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Parent Related Parties

Agreement; or (3) pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable. In no event will any of the Company Related

behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation (except
for intentional common law fraud or pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or pursuant to Section

law fraud or pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable, in no
event will any Company Related Parties be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind,
including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation

Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter,
the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or any claims or actions under
applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Nothing in this Section 8.3(e)(i) will
preclude any liability of the Debt Financing Sources to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under the
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or limit the Company (following the Closing), Parent or
Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to
any Debt Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. In no
event will any Parent Related Party other than the Guarantors (solely as and to the extent provided in the
Equity Commitment Letter), Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the
Company or any other Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger.
(ii) For the Parent Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b), any
Enforcement Expenses and Parent’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10(b) will be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties in respect of
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the Merger. Upon
payment of the Company Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b)) and any
Enforcement Expenses, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to
any of the Parent Related Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents,
or for any matters forming the basis of such termination, except that the Parties or their respective Affiliates
(or both) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
Confidentiality Agreement and Section 8.2 and Section 8.3(a), as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 8.3(e)(ii) will not relieve the Company from any liability (1) for any intentional
common law fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, except that under no circumstances will the
collective monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches (including for any Willful Breach (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, intentional common law fraud)) under this Agreement (taking into
account the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed an amount, in
the aggregate, equal to the amount of the Company Termination Fee plus any Enforcement Expenses (such
aggregate amount, the “Company Liability Limitation”) or (2) for any breaches of the Confidentiality
Agreement; or (3) pursuant to Section 8.3(a). In no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or
obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek
or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Liability Limitation (except for
intentional common law fraud, pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as
applicable) against the Company Related Parties, and, other than with respect to intentional common law
fraud, pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, or pursuant to Section 8.3(a), as applicable, in no event
will Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including
