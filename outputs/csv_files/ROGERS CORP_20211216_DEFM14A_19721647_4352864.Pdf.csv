Parties to the Merger (Page 23)
On November 1, 2021, the Company entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Parent and Merger Sub (as
it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) providing for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
specified conditions, the acquisition of the Company by Parent. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “merger”), with the Company
surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The parties to the Merger Agreement and the merger

The Special Meeting (Page 19)
Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting (Page 19)
The special meeting of the shareholders of the Company (the “special meeting”), will be held on January 25, 2022,
starting at 8:30 AM, local time. You will be able to attend the special meeting in person at 2225 W. Chandler Blvd.,
Chandler, AZ 85224 or virtually via webcast at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ROG2022SM.
At the special meeting, holders (“shareholders”) of the Capital Stock of the Company, $1.00 par value per share
(“Company capital stock”), will be asked to consider and vote on:
•
a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement;
•
a proposal to approve, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the “golden parachute” compensation that may be
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger as reported on the Golden Parachute
Compensation table on page 48; and
•
a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
Merger Agreement.
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Record Date and Quorum (Page 19)
You are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting if you owned shares of Company capital
stock as of the close of business on December 15, 2021, which is the date we have set as the record date for the
special meeting (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote for each share of Company capital stock that you owned
on the Record Date. As of the Record Date there were 18,730,099 shares of Company capital stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting, including
the approval of the Merger Agreement and approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden
parachute” compensation. The holders of record of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast, attending the meeting
in person (including virtually) or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the purposes of the special meeting. The
Company’s bylaws (as amended, our “bylaws”) provide that a special meeting may be adjourned by a lesser number
without further notice until a quorum is secured.
Vote Required (Page 19)
Approval of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66
2/3% of the shares of Company capital stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Record Date.
Under our bylaws, approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and
approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger
Agreement, will require that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes cast
opposing the proposal, among votes cast by holders present or represented at the special meeting and entitled to
vote and voting on such matter. A majority of the shares entitled to vote will constitute a quorum for the purposes of
the meeting; however, the meeting may be adjourned by a majority of the votes cast at the meeting (including by
proxy), even if a quorum is not present.
Shares Owned by Our Directors and Executive Officers (Page 21)
As of the Record Date, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned and were entitled to
vote, in the aggregate, 220,807 shares of Company capital stock, representing 1.18% of the outstanding shares of
Company capital stock on the Record Date. Each of the directors and executive officers has informed the Company
that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Company capital stock “FOR” the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement, “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute”
compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
Merger Agreement.
Proxies and Revocation (Page 21)
Any shareholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet,
or by returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or may vote by ballot at the
special meeting. If your shares of Company capital stock are held in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee, you should instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote your shares of
Company capital stock using the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. Please note
that if you are a beneficial owner of shares of Company capital stock held in “street name” and wish to vote at the
special meeting, you must provide a valid proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee at the special
meeting. Accordingly, if you hold your shares of Company capital stock in “street name,” please contact your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee for their instructions on how to vote your shares.
If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote at the special meeting, or if you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee with voting instructions, your shares of Company capital stock will not be voted on the proposal to
approve the Merger Agreement, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement. Conversely, your unvoted shares of Company capital stock will not have an effect on approval of
the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation or the proposal to approve one or
more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement.
You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before
it is exercised, by submitting a later-dated proxy through any of the methods available to you, by giving written
notice
2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of Rogers Corporation, which must be filed with the Corporate Secretary by
the time the special meeting begins, or by attending in person (including virtually) and voting at the special meeting.
Attendance at the special meeting alone will not revoke your proxy.
The Merger (Page 24)
The Merger Agreement provides that Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company. The Company will be the
Surviving Corporation in the merger and will continue to do business following the merger. As a result of the merger,
the Company will become a privately held company and will cease to be listed on any public market. If the merger is
consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
Merger Consideration (Page 58)
In the merger, each share of Company capital stock, other than as provided below, will be converted into the right to
receive $277.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required tax withholding (the “Merger
Consideration”). The following shares of Company capital stock will not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in connection with the merger:
•
shares owned by any subsidiary of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent;
and
•
shares held by any of our shareholders who have not voted such shares in favor of the Merger Agreement,
who are entitled to appraisal rights, and who have properly exercised such rights in accordance with the
MBCA.
We sometimes refer to the shares described in the foregoing sentence, collectively, as the “Excluded Shares”.
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board of Directors (Page 31)
After careful consideration of various factors described in the section entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Board of Directors,” the Board, by a unanimous vote of all directors:
•
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and declared it advisable, for
the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement;
•
adopted the Merger Agreement;
•
approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the merger; and
•
resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s shareholders.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement, “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and
“FOR” approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve
the Merger Agreement.
Opinion of Financial Advisor (Page 35)
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 11, 2021, the Company retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P.
Morgan”) as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger.
At the meeting of the Board on November 1, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to
be paid to the holders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such shareholders. J.P. Morgan confirmed its November 1, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion
to the Board, dated November 1, 2021, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
shares of Company capital stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated November 1, 2021, which sets forth, among other things,
the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in
this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion.
3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Company’s shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was
addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the
proposed merger, was directed only to the Merger Consideration to be paid in the proposed merger and did not
address any other aspect of the proposed merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger
Consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as
to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the proposed merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion
was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger or any
other matter.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Opinion of Financial
Advisor” beginning on page 35.
Financing of the Merger (Page 41)
Parent estimates that the total amount of funds required by it to complete the merger and related transactions,
including to pay fees and expenses in connection with the merger, is approximately $5.2 billion. Parent expects to fund
this amount through debt financing and net cash of the Company. Parent plans on using a portion of the proceeds
from the planned divestiture of a substantial portion of the Mobility & Materials segment to repay all acquisition
financing related to Rogers. The consummation of the merger is not subject to a financing condition. See “The
Merger-Financing of the Merger” for additional information.
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (Page 42)
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that the
Company’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of our shareholders generally, as more fully described below. The Board was aware of these interests
and considered them, among other matters, in reaching the determination that the merger and the Merger Agreement
were in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and in making the Board’s recommendation regarding
the approval of the Merger Agreement as described in “The Merger-Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the
Board of Directors” beginning on page 31. These interests include, among others:
•
accelerated settlement of deferred stock units held by the Company’s directors and cancellation and
conversion of each such deferred stock unit award into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the
Merger Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Company capital stock underlying such
deferred stock unit award, on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement;
•
accelerated vesting of Company restricted stock unit awards held by the Company’s executive officers that
were granted before November 1, 2021, and cancellation and conversion of each such restricted stock unit
award into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the total
number of shares of Company capital stock underlying such restricted stock unit award then deemed
vested, on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement;
•
the potential grant of restricted stock unit awards by the Company to executive officers on terms that
permit one-third vesting of such restricted stock unit awards granted on or after November 1, 2021 upon
certain qualifying terminations that occur at or after the Effective Time and within one year of the grant date
of such restricted stock unit awards, on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement;
•
accelerated vesting of Company performance-based share unit awards outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time held by the Company’s executive officers, and cancellation and conversion of each such
performance-based share unit award into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Company capital stock that vest under such
performance-based share unit award based on 120% of the target level of performance achievement, on the
terms set forth in the Merger Agreement;
•
in the event of certain terminations of employment, cash payments payable, continued health and dental
coverage benefits provided and outplacement benefits provided, to executive officers of the Company
pursuant to certain severance agreements between the Company and our executive officers;
4
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
tax reimbursements for the Company’s executive officers for the excise tax imposed on payments and
benefits made in connection with the merger to executive officers by reason of Section 4999 of the Code;
and
•
continued indemnification and liability insurance for directors and officers following completion of the
merger.
See “The Merger-Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger” beginning on page 42 for additional information.
Approval of “Golden Parachute” Compensation (Page 48)
In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule
14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, we are providing shareholders with the opportunity to cast a nonbinding advisory
vote with respect to certain payments that may be made to our named executive officers in connection with the
merger, or “golden parachute” compensation, as reported on the Golden Parachute Compensation table on page 48.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding
“golden parachute” compensation.
Approval of the proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation requires the affirmative vote of a greater
number of the votes cast in favor of this proposal than votes cast against this proposal. Approval of this proposal is
not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote with respect to “golden parachute” compensation is an
advisory vote and will not be binding on us. Therefore, regardless of whether shareholders approve the “golden
parachute” compensation, if the Merger Agreement is approved by the shareholders and the merger is completed, the
“golden parachute” compensation will still be paid to our named executive officers to the extent payable in
accordance with the terms of such compensation.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 50)
The exchange of shares of Company capital stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable
transaction to U.S. holders and certain non-U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder (or a non-
U.S. holder that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its gain from the merger) that exchanges shares of Company
capital stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received (determined before deduction of any
applicable withholding taxes) with respect to such shares and the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.
This exchange may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and/or foreign income or other tax laws.
You should read “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 50 for the
definition of “U.S. holder” and “non-U.S. holder” and a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. You should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the
merger on your U.S. federal, state and local and/or foreign taxes.
Regulatory Approvals (Page 52)
The merger is subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. In addition to the foregoing, Parent, the Company and/or Merger Sub are
required under the Merger Agreement to make certain other antitrust and foreign direct investment related filings with
governmental authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions in connection with the merger. Under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the merger cannot be consummated if any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order, executive order, temporary restraining order, stay, decree,
judgment or injunction (preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule or regulation which has the effect of making the
merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger.
Litigation Relating to the Merger (Page 53)
Lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Board or the Company’s officers in connection with the merger,
which could prevent or delay completion of the merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, two lawsuits have
been filed by purported shareholders of the Company in connection with the merger. The complaints generally allege
that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) (and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act
by, among other things, including allegedly materially misleading or incomplete disclosure with respect to certain
5
TABLE OF CONTENTS
financial projections and analyses in the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on December 1, 2021. The
plaintiffs in the lawsuits seek, among other things, injunctive relief, money damages and the costs of the lawsuits,
including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees. The Company and the members of the Board disagree with and
intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuits. If the complaints are not resolved on a timely basis, they could
delay consummation of the merger and result in additional costs to the Company, including costs associated with the
indemnification of directors. Additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Board or the Company’s
officers in connection with the merger, which could prevent or delay completion of the merger.
The Merger Agreement (Page 54)
Merger Consideration (Page 58)
At the Effective Time (as defined below), each share of Company capital stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, will automatically be converted into the right to receive
$277.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required tax withholding.
Treatment of Equity Awards (Page 59)
At the Effective Time of the merger, each Company deferred stock unit or time vesting restricted stock unit granted
under the Company’s 2019 Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan (each, an “RSU”), excluding Post-Signing Company
RSUs as defined below, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company RSU”) will
become fully vested and will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company capital stock subject to such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable required withholdings. Each Company RSU
that is granted on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, excluding any such Company RSU granted to a non-
employee director (a “Post-Signing Company RSU”), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
will be assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a restricted stock unit in respect of shares of Parent
common stock with the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such Post-Signing Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Parent RSU”), except that such Parent RSU will relate to a number of shares
of Parent common stock that is determined based on the ratio of the Merger Consideration to the average closing
price per share of Parent’s capital stock for the period of ten consecutive trading days preceding the last trading day
prior to the closing date of the merger.
Each Company restricted stock unit subject to performance-based vesting criteria that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company PSU”) will become fully vested and will automatically be
canceled and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the number of Shares subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time based
on 120% of the target level of performance achievement, less applicable withholdings.
Restrictions on the Solicitation of Other Offers (Page 64)
The Company, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and employees may not, and the Company must
use reasonable best efforts to cause its other representatives not to, take certain actions in connection with the
solicitation of an alternative Acquisition Proposal. In particular, the Company is restricted from taking any of the
following actions:
•
initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging (including by way of furnishing information relating to the
Company) or knowingly taking any action designed to facilitate any an Acquisition Proposal;
•
engaging in, continuing or otherwise participating in any discussions with or negotiations relating to any
Acquisition Proposal;
•
providing any nonpublic information relating to, or affording access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of, the Company to any person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal;
•
otherwise knowingly facilitating any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal; or
•
taking any action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover statute, or any restrictive provision of any
applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company’s organizational documents, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal; or
•
resolving, agreeing, authorizing, or committing to do any of the foregoing.
6
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining approval of the merger by the holders of 66
2/3% of the outstanding shares of Company capital stock (the “Requisite Company Vote”), if the Company receives a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise from a breach of the restrictions described above and the
Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that, based on
the information then available, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal, or could reasonably
be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may:
•
provide information in response to a request by the person making such Acquisition Proposal; and
•
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, and only with, the person making the Acquisition
Proposal.
The Company must promptly, and in any event, within twenty-four hours give notice to Parent if the Company or any
of its Representatives receives any Acquisition Proposal and thereafter must keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status and material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, and discussions or negotiations concerning the material
terms thereof and as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within twenty-four hours following the receipt or
delivery thereof, provide Parent with unredacted copies of any written proposal, proposed transaction agreement or
other written material that describes the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.
You should read “Summary of the Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company
Shareholders” beginning on page 65 for the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” and “Superior Proposal.”
Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company Shareholders (Page 65)
The Company may not enter into an agreement with another party in respect of an alternative Acquisition Proposal or
make a Change of Recommendation except in compliance with the specific requirements of the Merger Agreement, as
described below. A “Change of Recommendation” includes any of the following actions by the Board:
•
withholding, withdrawing, qualifying, amending or modifying (or publicly proposing or resolving to
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify) its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub;
•
following the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public or sent
or given to shareholders of the Company, failing to issue a press release publicly reaffirming its
recommendation within ten business days (or, if earlier, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting)
following Parent’s written request to do so;
•
failing to include its recommendation in this proxy statement or make or expressly authorize by resolution
the making of any public statement by any Company officer or director that is known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by the Board to have the same consequences as a withdrawal, qualification, amendment or
modification of the Company Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement);
•
failing to recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer by its shareholders under Rule 14d-2
of the Exchange Act for outstanding shares of Company capital stock, within ten business days after
receipt of a written request of Parent following the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
(or, if earlier, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting); or
•
approving or recommending, or publicly declaring advisable or publicly proposing to approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or publicly proposing to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company
receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise from a material breach of the Company’s no-
solicitation obligations, and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company may effect a
Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive written agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal. Provided, however, that before taking any action set out in the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company must give Parent written notice of such action (and the basis therefor) four
business days in advance, the Company must negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to revise the Merger Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior
Proposal and, at the end of four business days from the date of notice to Parent, the Board must determine, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, taking into account any changes to the terms of the
Merger Agreement
7
TABLE OF CONTENTS
proposed in writing by Parent, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.
Simultaneously with a termination by Parent as a result of a Change of Recommendation or by the Company in order
to enter into a definitive written agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal, the Company will be obligated to
pay the Company Termination Fee, as defined below.
Furthermore, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation
if an Intervening Event, as defined below, has occurred and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response
to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law. However, prior to recommending such Acquisition Proposal, the Board must provide written notice of
such action and the basis therefor four business days in advance (such notice to include a reasonably detailed
description of the Intervening Event), the Company must negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent
wishes to negotiate) to revise the Merger Agreement, and the Board must determine in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that, taking into account any changes to the terms of the
Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, such Intervening Event remains in effect and the failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable law.
You should read “Summary of the Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company
Shareholders” beginning on page 65 for the definition of “Intervening Event.”
Termination (Page 70)
The Merger Agreement may be terminated by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company at any prior time
prior to the Effective Time and may also be terminated by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time will not
have occurred on the date that is six months from the date of the Merger Agreement (the “Outside Date”). However,
if certain conditions to closing relating to governmental antitrust or foreign direct investment approvals have not
been satisfied or waived as of the Outside Date, but all other conditions have been satisfied, then the Outside Date
will be extended for an additional three months after the initial Outside Date. Additionally, if such conditions to
closing related to such approvals have not been satisfied as of such extended Outside Date, then the Outside Date
will be further extended for an additional three months after the first extended Outside Date (for a final Outside Date
that is a year from signing). The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either Parent or the Company, if a
governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted any law or order that permanently prohibits the
consummation of the merger, and such law or order has become final and non-appealable. The Merger Agreement
may also be terminated by either Parent or the Company if the Requisite Company Vote will not have been obtained at
the Company Shareholders Meeting or the final adjournment or postponement thereof.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated by Parent, prior to the obtainment of the Requisite Company Vote, if the
Board will have made a Change of Recommendation or if the Company or its representatives have materially breached
their no-solicitation and other obligations under Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement and by Parent, prior to the
Effective Time, if the Company has breached any of its representations, warranties, or covenants such that relevant
conditions to closing are not satisfied and such breach is not curable prior to the Outside Date (or if curable prior to
the Outside Date, has not been cured within the earlier of 30 days after notice by Parent to the Company or three
business days before the Outside Date). The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by Parent, prior to the
Effective Time, if a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction in the U.S. or certain foreign jurisdictions will have
entered an order in connection with a requisite governmental approval that has become final and non-appealable,
remains in effect, and requires Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and its subsidiaries) to take
actions that would have a Burdensome Effect.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated by the Company, prior to the Effective Time, if Parent has breached any of
its representations, warranties, or covenants such that relevant conditions to closing are not satisfied and such
breach is not curable prior to the Outside Date (or if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured within the
earlier of 30 days after notice by the Company to Parent or three business days before the Outside Date). The Merger
Agreement may also be terminated by the Company, prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, in order
to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal. Such Superior Proposal termination
would trigger the immediate payment of the Company Termination Fee, as defined below.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Termination Fees (Page 71)
The Merger Agreement provides for, in certain circumstances, a termination fee payable by the Company to Parent in
an amount of $135 million (the “Company Termination Fee”). The Company would be obligated to pay the Company
Termination Fee to Parent in the following circumstances:
•
either party terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of the merger not having been consummated by
the Outside Date or as a result of the Requisite Company Vote not having been obtained at the Company
Shareholders Meeting and, in either case, (i) an Acquisition Proposal is publicly made directly to the
Company’s shareholders or is otherwise publicly known or any person has publicly announced an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, and such proposal or intention has not been publicly withdrawn
prior to the date of such termination (with respect to any termination in connection with the failure to
consummate the merger by the Outside Date) or the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting (with
respect to any termination in connection with the failure to obtain the Requisite Company Vote) and (ii)
within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into an alternative
acquisition agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or there will have been consummated any
Acquisition Proposal (with “fifty percent” being substituted in lieu of “twenty percent” in the definition
thereof);
•
Parent terminates the Merger Agreement because the Board has made a Change of Recommendation or the
Company or its representatives have materially breached their no-solicitation or other obligations in
Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement;
•
either party terminates the Merger Agreement because the Requisite Company Vote is not obtained and
Parent had the right to terminate the Merger Agreement because the Board made a Change of
Recommendation; or
•
the Company terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive written agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal.
The Merger Agreement provides for, in certain circumstances, a termination fee payable by Parent to the Company in
an amount of $162.5 million (the “Regulatory Termination Fee”). Parent would be obligated to pay the Regulatory
Termination Fee to the Company in the following circumstances:
•
either Parent or the Company terminates the Merger Agreement because a governmental entity of
competent jurisdiction in the U.S. or certain foreign jurisdictions has enacted a final, non-appealable law or
order related to applicable antitrust or foreign investment laws that permanently prohibits the
consummation of the merger;
•
either party terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of the merger not having been consummated by
the Outside Date and certain conditions to closing related to antitrust or foreign investment laws have not
been satisfied, but all of Parent’s other conditions have been satisfied or would be capable of being
satisfied if the closing were to occur; and
•
Parent terminates the Merger Agreement because a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction in the
U.S. or certain foreign jurisdictions has entered an order in connection with a requisite governmental
approval that has become final and non-appealable, remains in effect, and requires Parent or any of its
subsidiaries to take actions that would have a Burdensome Effect and certain conditions to closing related
to antitrust or foreign investment laws have not been satisfied, but all of Parent’s other conditions (other
than receipt of Requisite Company Vote if the final shareholder meeting has not yet occurred and the
Company has complied with its obligations in respect of the meeting) have been satisfied or would be
capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur (subject to a 30-day cure period if there is a Material
Adverse Effect at such time).
You should read “Summary of the Merger Agreement-Definition of Material Adverse Effect” beginning on page 62
for the definition of “Material Adverse Effect.”
Market Price of Company Capital Stock (Page 73)
On November 1, 2021, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Company’s entry into the Merger
Agreement, the closing price per share of the Company’s capital stock was $208.23. On December 13, 2021, the
closing price per share of the Company’s capital stock was $271.25. You are encouraged to obtain current market
quotations for Company capital stock in connection with voting your shares of Company capital stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Appraisal Rights (Page 76)
Under the MBCA, the Company is required to state whether it has concluded that Company shareholders are, are not
or may be entitled to assert appraisal rights, which are generally available to shareholders of a merging
Massachusetts corporation under Section 13.02(a)(1) of the MBCA, subject to certain exceptions. For the reasons
described under “Appraisal Rights,” the Company has concluded that Company shareholders may be entitled to
appraisal rights. The Company and Parent reserve the right to contest the validity and availability of any purported
demand for appraisal rights in connection with the merger.
Under Part 13 of the MBCA, Company shareholders who believe they are or may be entitled to appraisal rights in
connection with the merger must, in order to exercise those rights:
•
prior to the special meeting, deliver to the Company a written notice of intent to demand payment for such
shareholders’ shares of Company capital stock if the merger is effectuated;
•
NOT vote for the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement; and
•
comply with other procedures under Part 13 of the MBCA.
YOUR FAILURE TO FOLLOW EXACTLY THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED UNDER THE MBCA WILL RESULT IN
THE LOSS OF ANY APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK
THROUGH A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE MAKING OF A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL BY YOUR
BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE. SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED “APPRAISAL RIGHTS” AND THE
TEXT OF PART 13 OF THE MBCA REPRODUCED IN ITS ENTIRETY AS ANNEX C TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.
Delisting and Deregistration of Company Capital Stock (Page 79)
If the merger is consummated, the Company capital stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the
Exchange Act. Accordingly, following the consummation of the merger, we would no longer file periodic reports with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), on account of the Company capital stock.
Conduct of Our Business if the Merger is Not Completed (Page 79)
In the event that the Merger Agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, our shareholders will not receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for their shares of
Company capital stock. Instead, we would remain an independent public company, our capital stock would continue
to be listed and traded on the NYSE and our shareholders would continue to be subject to the same risks and
opportunities to which they currently are subject with respect to their ownership of Company capital stock. If the
merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future
value of our shares, including the risk that the market price of Company capital stock may decline to the extent that
the current market price of our stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. If the merger is
not completed, our business could be disrupted, including our ability to retain and hire key personnel, potential
adverse reactions or changes to our business relationships and uncertainty surrounding our future plans and
prospects.

ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the
merger, the Merger Agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions
that may be important to you as a Company shareholder. Please refer to the “Summary” and the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents
referred to in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the
information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 80.
Q.
What is the proposed transaction and what effects will it have on the Company?
A.
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement is approved by our shareholders and the other closing conditions
under the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company being the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the merger, the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent and will no longer be a publicly held corporation, and you will no longer have any interest
in our future earnings or growth. In addition, the Company capital stock will be delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on
account of Company capital stock.
Q.
What will I receive if the merger is consummated?
A.
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share Merger Consideration of $277.00 in
cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, for each share of Company
capital stock that you own, unless you are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal under Part 13 of the
MBCA. For example, if you own 1,000 shares of Company capital stock, you will receive $277,000 in cash in
exchange for your shares of Company capital stock, without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding tax. You will not receive any shares of the capital stock in the Surviving Corporation.
Q.
How does the per share Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Company capital stock prior to
announcement of the merger?
A.
The Merger Consideration of $277.00 per share of Company capital stock represents an approximately 33%
premium to the closing price per share of the Company’s capital stock on November 1, 2021, the last full trading
day prior to the announcement of the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement, when the closing price per
share was $208.23. The Merger Consideration also represents a 46% premium to the Volume-Weighted Average
Price of the Company’s capital stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange for the thirty days preceding
November 1, 2021.
Q.
What will holders of Company stock awards receive if the merger is consummated?
A.
Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the merger, each Company restricted stock unit award
that is then outstanding and unvested (excluding any Post-Signing Company RSUs) will vest in full and
automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the product of the
total number of shares of Company capital stock then underlying such Company restricted stock unit award
then deemed vested multiplied by the Merger Consideration, on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the merger, each Company performance-based share
unit award that is then outstanding and unvested will become fully vested and will automatically be canceled
and converted into the right to receive from the Company an amount of cash equal to the product of the total
number of shares of Company capital stock that vest under such performance-based share unit award based on
120% of the target level of performance achievement, multiplied by the Merger Consideration, on the terms set
forth in the Merger Agreement.
Each Post-Signing Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding
any such Company RSU granted to a non-employee director, will be assumed by Parent and converted
automatically into a Parent RSU, except that such Parent RSU will relate to a number of shares of Parent common
stock that is determined based on the ratio of the Merger Consideration to the average closing price per share of
Parent’s capital stock for the period of ten consecutive trading days preceding the last trading day prior to the
closing date of the Merger.

1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
What will happen to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)?
A.
Any offering period that commenced prior to November 1, 2021 shall end as of a date selected by the Company
prior to the Effective Time of the merger, and each outstanding right to purchase shares of capital stock of the
Company granted under such plan will be automatically exercised as of that date. Until the merger is effective or
the Merger Agreement is terminated, no new offering period may commence under the ESPP.
Q.
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement, “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation
and “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary
or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
approve the Merger Agreement.
Q.
Why is the Board recommending that I vote “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement?
A.
After careful consideration of various factors described in the section entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the
Merger; Recommendation of the Board of Directors,” the Board, by a unanimous vote of all directors:
•
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and declared it
advisable, for the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement;
•
adopted the Merger Agreement;
•
approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the merger; and
•
resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s shareholders.
Q.
When do you expect the merger to be consummated?
A.
We are working towards completing the merger as soon as possible. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary
closing conditions, including the approval by our shareholders of the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement, we currently anticipate that the merger will be consummated in the second quarter of 2022.
Q.
What happens if the merger is not consummated?
A.
If the Merger Agreement is not approved by the shareholders of the Company or if the merger is not
consummated for any other reason, the shareholders of the Company would not receive any payment for their
shares of Company capital stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company would remain an
independent public company, and the Company capital stock would continue to be listed and traded on the New
York Stock Exchange. Under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to Parent a fee with
respect to the termination of the Merger Agreement or Parent may be required to pay to the Company a fee with
respect to the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section entitled “Summary of the
Merger Agreement-Termination Fees” beginning on page 71.
Q.
Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?
A.
Yes. The exchange of shares of Company capital stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable
transaction to U.S. holders and certain non-U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder (or a
non-U.S. holder that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its gain from the merger) that exchanges shares of
Company capital stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received (determined before
deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) with respect to such shares and the shareholder’s adjusted tax
basis in such shares. This may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and/or foreign income
or other tax laws. You should read “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
beginning on page 50 for the definition of “U.S. holder” and “non-U.S. holder” and a more detailed discussion of
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Because individual circumstances may differ, you
should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the merger on your U.S. federal,
state and local and/or foreign taxes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
Do any of the Company’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in
addition to my interests as a shareholder?
A.
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may
be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. The Board was aware of and
considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the
merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be approved by the shareholders of the Company. See
“The Merger-Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger” beginning on page 42.
Q.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form?
A.
You are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the special meeting because you owned shares of Company capital
stock as of the Record Date for the special meeting. This proxy statement describes matters on which we urge
you to vote and is intended to assist you in deciding how to vote your shares of Company capital stock with
respect to such matters.
Q.
When and where is the special meeting?
A.
The special meeting of shareholders of the Company will be held on January 25, 2022 at 8:30 AM, local time, at
2225 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, AZ 85224 and virtually via live webcast. If you choose to attend virtually, you
will be able to attend the special meeting and vote your shares electronically by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ROG2022SM.
Q.
What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
A.
You are being asked to consider and vote on:
•
a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement;
•
a proposal to approve, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the “golden parachute” compensation that
may be payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger as reported on the
Golden Parachute Compensation table on page 48; and
•
a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
Merger Agreement.
Q.
What vote is required for the Company’s shareholders to approve the Merger Agreement?
A.
The approval of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding shares of Company capital stock entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date.
Because the affirmative vote required to approve the Merger Agreement is based upon the total number of
outstanding shares of Company capital stock, if you fail to submit a proxy or to vote a ballot at the special
meeting, or if you vote “ABSTAIN,” or if you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with
voting instructions, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement.
Q.
What vote is required for the Company’s shareholders to approve the proposal regarding “golden parachute”
compensation and the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
approve the Merger Agreement?
A.
Approval of the proposals regarding “golden parachute” compensation and adjournment of the special meeting,
if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to approve the Merger Agreement, requires that a greater number of votes of the holders of the stock
present or represented at the special meeting vote, and entitled to vote and voting, vote in favor of each of these
proposals than vote against each of these proposals.
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you vote “ABSTAIN” on the proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation or the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement, this
will have no effect on these proposals. If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote a ballot at the special meeting, or if
you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares of
Company capital stock will not be voted on these proposals, and thus will have no effect on these proposals.
Q.
Why am I being asked to cast a nonbinding advisory vote to approve “golden parachute” compensation that the
Company’s named executive officers will receive in connection with the merger?
A.
The SEC’s rules require us to seek a nonbinding advisory vote with respect to certain payments that will be
made to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, or “golden parachute” compensation.
Q.
What will happen if shareholders do not approve the “golden parachute” compensation at the special meeting?
A.
Approval of “golden parachute” compensation that our named executive officers may receive in connection with
the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote with respect to “golden parachute”
compensation is an advisory vote and will not be binding on us. Therefore, regardless of whether shareholders
approve the “golden parachute” compensation, if the Merger Agreement is approved by the shareholders and
the merger is completed, the “golden parachute” compensation may still be paid to our named executive officers
to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of such compensation arrangements.
Q.
Who can vote at the special meeting?
A.
All of our holders of Company capital stock of record as of the close of business on December 15, 2021, the
Record Date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Each
holder of Company capital stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before the special
meeting for each share of Company capital stock that such holder owned as of the Record Date.
Q.
What is a “broker non-vote”?
A.
Banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for customers have the authority to
vote on “discretionary” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However,
banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to
approving non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, the proposal to
approve the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement, and,
as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of Company capital stock,
banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of Company capital stock on
non-discretionary matters, which we refer to generally as “broker non-votes.”
Q.
What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?
A.
A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting, including the approval of the Merger
Agreement and approval of the proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation. The holders of record of
a majority of the votes entitled to be cast, appearing in person (including virtually) or by proxy, shall constitute a
quorum for the purposes of the special meeting. Abstentions and “broker non-votes” (as described above) in
attendance at the meeting will be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is
present.
Q.
How do I vote?
A.
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote your shares of Company capital stock, or have such shares
voted, on matters presented at the special meeting in any of the following ways:
•
live attendance-you may attend the special meeting in person (including virtually), and cast your vote
there; or
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
by proxy-shareholders of record have a choice of having their shares voted by proxy by submitting a
proxy in one of the following ways:
○
over the Internet-the website for Internet proxy submission is on your proxy card;
○
by using a toll-free telephone number noted on your proxy card; or
○
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply
envelope.
If you hold your shares of Company capital stock in “street name,” please refer to the instructions provided by
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above choices are available to you. Please note
that if you are a beneficial owner of shares of Company capital stock held in “street name” and wish to vote at
the special meeting, you must provide a valid proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee at the
special meeting.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to submit a
proxy for your shares of Company capital stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been
properly recorded when submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone.
Q.
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and in “street name”?
A.
If your shares of Company capital stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,
Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares of Company capital stock, as the “shareholder
of record.” This proxy statement, and your proxy card, have been sent directly to you by the Company.
If your shares of Company capital stock are held through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are
considered the beneficial owner of shares of Company capital stock held in “street name.” In that case, this
proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee who is considered,
with respect to those shares of Company capital stock, the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner of
shares of Company capital stock held in “street name,” you have the right to direct your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee how to vote your shares of Company capital stock by following their instructions for voting.
Q.
If my shares of Company capital stock are held in “street name” by my bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee, will my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee vote my shares of Company capital stock for me?
.
Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of Company capital stock
if you instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures
provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares of Company capital
stock. If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares of Company capital
stock, your shares of Company capital stock will not be voted and the effect will be the same as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and your shares of Company capital stock will not
have an effect on approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation or
the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger
Agreement.
Q.
How can I change or revoke my proxy?
A.
You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time
before it is exercised, by submitting a later-dated proxy through any of the methods available to you, by giving
written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of Rogers, which must be filed with the Corporate
Secretary by the time the special meeting begins, or by attending (including virtually) the special meeting and
voting. Attendance at the special meeting alone will not revoke your proxy.
Q.
What is a proxy?
A.
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Company
capital stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Company capital
stock is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated Bruce Hoechner, Ram Mayampurath and Jay Knoll,
and each of them singly, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the special meeting.
Q.
If a shareholder gives a proxy, how will its shares of Company capital stock be voted?
A.
Regardless of the method you choose to submit your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card,
as your proxies, will vote your shares of Company capital stock in the way that you indicate. When completing
the Internet or telephone proxy processes or the enclosed proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of
Company capital stock should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the
specific items of business to come before the special meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of Company capital
stock should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR”
the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal
regarding “golden parachute” compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of
the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the
time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement.
Q.
How are votes counted?
A.
With respect to the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or
“ABSTAIN.” Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to
approve the Merger Agreement.
With respect to the proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and the proposal to approve one or
more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement, you may vote “FOR,”
“AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on these proposals.
Q.
What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
A.
If you hold shares of Company capital stock in more than one account, you may receive more than one proxy or
set of voting instructions relating to the special meeting. These should each be voted or returned separately in
accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy statement in order to ensure that all of your shares of
Company capital stock are voted.
Q.
What happens if I sell my shares of Company capital stock before the special meeting?
A.
The Record Date for shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than both the date of the
special meeting and the consummation of the merger. If you transfer your shares of Company capital stock after
the Record Date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are
made between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares and each of you notifies the Company in
writing of such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the special meeting but
will transfer the right to receive the per share Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares. You will also lose the ability to exercise appraisal rights with respect to such shares in connection with
the merger.
Q.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A.
The Company will pay all expenses of filing, printing and mailing this proxy statement, including solicitation
expenses. The Company has engaged Innisfree to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting.
The Company estimates that it will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $30,000. The Company will also
reimburse Innisfree for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify Innisfree and its affiliates against
certain claims, expenses, losses, damages, liabilities and judgments. The Company may also reimburse brokers,
banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of shares of Company
capital stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Company capital stock
and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit
proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional
amounts for soliciting proxies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
What do I need to do now?
A.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information contained
in this proxy statement, please submit your proxy promptly to ensure that your shares are represented at the
special meeting. If you hold your shares of Company capital stock in your own name as the shareholder of
record, please submit a proxy for your shares of Company capital stock by (a) completing, signing, dating and
returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, (b) using the telephone number
printed on your proxy card or (c) using the Internet proxy instructions printed on your proxy card. If you decide
to attend the special meeting and vote by ballot, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Company capital stock held in “street name,” please refer to the
instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above choices are
available to you.
Q.
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A.
No. A letter of transmittal will be mailed to you promptly, and in any event within three business days, after the
Effective Time of the merger, describing how you should surrender your shares of Company capital stock for the
per share Merger Consideration (the “Letter of Transmittal”). If your shares of Company capital stock are held in

Part 13 of the MBCA, Company shareholders who believe they are or may be entitled to appraisal rights in
connection with the merger must, in order to exercise those rights:
•
prior to the special meeting, deliver to the Company a written notice of intent to demand payment for
such shareholders’ shares of Company capital stock if the merger is effectuated;
•
NOT vote for the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement; and
•
comply with other procedures under Part 13 of the MBCA.
See “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 76. In addition, the text of Part 13 of the MBCA is reproduced in its
entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.
Q.
Are there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?
A.
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the merger. See “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Information” beginning on page 18.
Q.
Who can help answer my other questions?
A.

factors, many of which are outside of our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those

both our existing products and products currently under development; business interruptions due to catastrophes or

This proxy statement is being furnished to our shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Board for use
at the special meeting to be held on January 25, 2022 at 8:30 AM, local time, in person at 2225 W. Chandler Blvd.,
Chandler, AZ 85224 and virtually via live webcast at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ROG2022SM, or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof. At the special meeting, holders of Company capital stock will be asked to
approve the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, to approve the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding
“golden parachute” compensation and to approve the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement.
Our shareholders must approve the Merger Agreement in order for the merger to be consummated. If our
shareholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement, the merger will not be consummated. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully in its entirety.",27,27
ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,Record Date and Quorum,"Record Date and Quorum
We have fixed the close of business on December 15, 2021 as the Record Date for the special meeting, and only
holders of record of Company capital stock on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the special meeting. You are
entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting if you owned shares of Company capital stock at the
close of business on the Record Date. On the Record Date, there were 18,730,099 shares of Company capital stock
outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of Company capital stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters
properly coming before the special meeting.
The presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of capital stock
entitled to vote on a matter at the meeting constitutes a quorum with respect to that matter. Shares of Company
capital stock represented at the special meeting but not voted, including shares of Company capital stock for which a
shareholder directs voting “ABSTAIN”, as well as broker non-votes (described below), will be counted for purposes
of establishing a quorum. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting, including the approval
of the Merger Agreement and approval of the proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation. The special
meeting may be adjourned whether or not a quorum is present. Once a share of Company capital stock is represented
at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any
recess or adjournment of the special meeting. However, if a new Record Date is set for the adjourned special meeting,
then a new quorum will have to be established. In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, it is
expected that the special meeting will be adjourned or recessed.

Only shareholders of record or their duly authorized proxies or beneficial owners with proof of ownership have the
right to attend the special meeting. If your shares of Company capital stock are held through a bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee, please bring to the special meeting a copy of your brokerage statement evidencing your beneficial
ownership of Company capital stock. If you are the representative of a corporate or institutional shareholder, you
must present proof that you are the representative of such shareholder.
Vote Required",27,27
ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,Vote Required,"Vote Required
Approval of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the outstanding shares of Company capital stock entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date. For the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Voting “ABSTAIN”
will not be counted as a vote cast in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement but will count for the
purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote by ballot at the special
meeting, or if you vote “ABSTAIN,” it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement.
If your shares of Company capital stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare
Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares of Company capital stock, the “shareholder of
record.” This proxy statement and proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.

If your shares of Company capital stock are held through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered
the beneficial owner of shares of Company capital stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has
been forwarded to you by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those
shares of Company capital stock, the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner of shares of Company capital
stock held in “street name,” you have the right to direct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote your
shares by following their instructions for voting. If you hold your shares of Company capital stock in “street name,”
please contact your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for their instructions on how to vote your shares. Please
note that if you are a beneficial owner of shares of Company capital stock held in “street name” and wish to vote by
ballot at the special meeting, you must provide a valid proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee at the
special meeting.
Banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for customers have the authority to vote
on “discretionary” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks,
brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approving
non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve the
nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement, and, as a result, absent specific
instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of Company capital stock, banks, brokerage firms or other
nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of Company capital stock on non-discretionary matters, which we
refer to generally as “broker non-votes.” These broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining a
quorum if they choose to attend the special meeting, but will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.
Approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and approval of the
proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement,
require that a greater number of votes are cast in favor of the proposal than are cast against the proposal. For the
nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” For purposes
of each of these proposals, if you fail to submit a proxy or to vote a ballot at the special meeting, or if you have given
a proxy and vote “ABSTAIN,” the shares of Company capital stock will not be counted in respect of, and will not
have any effect on, the proposal.
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote your shares of Company capital stock, or have such shares voted,
on matters presented at the special meeting in any of the following ways:
•
by ballot-you may attend in person (including virtually) the special meeting and cast your vote there; or
•
by proxy-shareholders of record have a choice of having their shares voted by proxy by submitting a proxy
in one of the following ways:
○
over the Internet-the website for Internet proxy submission is on your proxy card;
○
by using a toll-free telephone number noted on your proxy card; or
○
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.
If you are a beneficial owner of Company capital stock held in “street name,” you will receive instructions from your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your shares of Company capital stock
voted. Those instructions will identify which of the above choices are available to you in order to have your shares
voted. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner of Company capital stock held in “street name” and wish to vote
by ballot at the special meeting, you must provide a valid proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to submit a proxy for
your shares of Company capital stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded
when submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone.
Please refer to the instructions on your proxy or voting instruction card to determine the deadlines for submitting a
proxy over the Internet or by telephone. If you choose to submit your proxy by mailing a proxy card, your proxy card

must be received by the Corporate Secretary of Rogers by the time the special meeting begins. Please do not send in
your stock certificates with your proxy card. Following the consummation of the merger, a separate Letter of
Transmittal will be mailed to you that will enable you to surrender your stock certificates and receive the per share
Merger Consideration.
If you vote by proxy, regardless of the method you choose to submit a proxy, the individuals named as your proxies
on the enclosed proxy card, and each of them, with full power of substitution, will vote your shares of Company
capital stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone proxy processes or the
enclosed proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of Company capital stock should be voted for or against
or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of Company capital stock
should be voted on a matter, the shares of Company capital stock represented by your properly signed proxy will be
voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal
regarding “golden parachute” compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the
special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement.

ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
Rogers’ Board of Directors, with the assistance of Rogers’ management, regularly evaluates Rogers’ short-, medium-
and long-term prospects and its multi-year business strategy in light of its performance, the general business and
economic environment, conditions in the advanced materials industry and the industries into which the Company’s
products are sold, and strategic and tactical opportunities available to and challenges facing Rogers, all with a view
toward enhancing long-term shareholder value. The Board’s evaluation of Rogers’ prospects and strategy involves
regular ongoing evaluations, including annual strategy reviews, and is informed by discussions with management,
industry consultants, advisors and investment banks regarding industry trends, financing considerations, global
policy matters and other factors pertaining to Rogers’ prospects and strategy.
In pursuit of its long-term strategic plan, over the last five years Rogers has invested in manufacturing capacity
expansion, additional technical and commercial resources, and operational improvements to support organic growth
opportunities and consummated several synergistic acquisitions for inorganic growth.
Rogers’ growth strategy has focused on developing and marketing specialized engineered materials for advanced
mobility and advanced connectivity applications, particularly in the automotive, portable electronics and
telecommunications industries, as well as other markets including general industrial, aerospace and defense, mass
transit and clean energy. Most recently, accelerating demand for electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEV) and
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in the global automotive industry has presented Rogers with an
inflecting growth opportunity that requires significant manufacturing capacity expansion, capabilities additions and
personnel hiring in the United States, China, and Europe, as well as potentially new markets, all of which require
significantly higher than historical capital expenditures and operating expense commitments.
On October 1, 2019, Rajiv Gupta, then a member of the board of directors of DuPont and acquaintance of Bruce
Hoechner, President and CEO of Rogers, contacted Mr. Hoechner to request a meeting between Mr. Hoechner and
Edward Breen, then serving as Executive Chairman of DuPont, to discuss the potential for a business combination
between the Company and DuPont.
On October 2, 2019, Mr. Breen spoke with Mr. Hoechner and expressed interest in acquiring the Company.
On October 10, 2019, the Company’s Board met at the Company’s headquarters in Chandler, Arizona and considered
the communication from DuPont and potential responses. During that meeting, a representative of Covington &
Burling LLP (“Covington”), legal counsel to the Company, briefed the Board on its fiduciary duties, including in the
context of an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The Board discussed the Company’s strategic plan, growth trajectory
and market opportunities. The Board concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Company to remain
independent and continue executing on its strategic growth plan, and, therefore, a meeting with Mr. Breen would not
be appropriate at that time. On October 11, 2019, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and communicated the Board’s
position regarding Mr. Breen’s meeting invitation. Mr. Breen agreed that, under the circumstances of the Board’s
position, a meeting would not be useful at that time.
On August 25, 2021, Mr. Gupta, although no longer a member of DuPont’s board of directors, contacted Mr.
Hoechner again to request a dinner meeting with Mr. Breen (now DuPont’s Executive Chairman and CEO). On

August 26, 2021 Mr. Hoechner conferred with Peter Wallace, Chairman of the Board of the Company, to discuss Mr.
Gupta’s invitation. They concluded that Mr. Hoechner should accept the meeting to listen to what Mr. Breen might
propose and assess his intentions. Mr. Wallace separately communicated with the other Board members regarding
the advisability and objectives of the proposed meeting.
On August 27, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Gupta to accept the meeting with Mr. Breen and to discuss
arrangements for scheduling a meeting on September 15, 2021.
On September 15, 2021, Mr. Hoechner met with Mr. Breen and Mr. Gupta for dinner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Mr.
Breen expressed interest in a negotiated acquisition of the Company by DuPont. Mr. Breen discussed DuPont’s
increased focus on market opportunities relating to advanced connectivity and advanced mobility and DuPont’s
desire to enhance its position in these markets through potential acquisitions. Mr. Breen further discussed his views
regarding the potential benefits of a transaction between the Company and DuPont, including the alignment of the
Company’s business with DuPont’s goals and interest in expanding in the advanced materials sector. Mr. Hoechner
advised Mr. Breen that he would discuss these matters with the Company’s Board.
On September 16, 2021, Mr. Hoechner conferred with Mr. Wallace and Board members Keith Barnes and Ganesh
Moorthy to discuss Mr. Hoechner’s meeting with Mr. Breen. Mr. Wallace also conferred with Board members Helene
Simonet and Keith Larson. The Board members expressed confidence in the Company’s strategic plan and
encouraged Mr. Hoechner to inform Mr. Breen that the Company was focused on continuing to execute such plan,
but may be interested in a transaction with DuPont that contemplated the purchase of all outstanding Company
capital stock at a price in excess of $300 per share. On September 16, 2021, the closing price per share of the
Company’s capital stock on the NYSE was $190.16.
On September 17, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and communicated that the Company was focused on
executing its strategic growth plan, but based on discussions with some members of the Board, Mr. Hoechner
believed the Company may be interested in a transaction with DuPont that contemplated the purchase of all
outstanding Company capital stock at a price in excess of $300 per share.
On September 20, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and conveyed that DuPont would not be able to meet a
$300 per share acquisition price, but that for the reasons discussed during the dinner in New Hope, DuPont remained
very interested in acquiring the Company and did not intend to abandon its pursuit of the Company as it had in 2019.
Accordingly, Mr. Breen indicated that he would be willing to send a letter to the Company’s Board to outline
DuPont's interest in, and commitment to pursuing, a transaction in a timely and efficient fashion if the Company's
Board would find it helpful to have DuPont's proposal in writing.
On September 21, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to invite continued discussion of an acquisition proposal
and offered to arrange a meeting between the parties to provide DuPont with an opportunity to better understand the
Company's value and growth trajectory. On September 22, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and provided a
list of preliminary due diligence topics for discussion in connection with a potential acquisition proposal.
On September 23, 2021, the Board held a special meeting by videoconference. At the meeting, Mr. Wallace and Mr.
Hoechner reported to the full Board on the communications to date between Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Breen. Jay Knoll,
Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and a representative of
Covington briefed the Board on its fiduciary duties, including in the context of an unsolicited acquisition offer. Mr.
Knoll and the representative of Covington also discussed related matters, such as the potential retention of a
financial advisor and the use of non-disclosure agreements with standstill provisions. The Board discussed the
retention of a financial advisor and recommended that the Company engage J.P. Morgan in this capacity as events
warranted, based on J.P. Morgan’s long-standing commercial banking relationship with the Company, regular
investment banking discussions involving the Company’s management and J.P. Morgan, relevant investment banking
experience involving J.P. Morgan and certain members of the Company’s Board, and J.P. Morgan’s industry
experience and overall strength as a financial advisor.
On September 24, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and stated that DuPont’s proposal to undertake
preliminary due diligence was premature and the Company would only consider providing DuPont access to due
diligence information in connection with a compelling acquisition proposal.
On September 27, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and delivered a proposal contemplating the purchase by
DuPont of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $240 per share.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Company requested that J.P. Morgan prepare a preliminary financial analysis to be reviewed with the Board,
including an assessment of DuPont’s proposal and transaction history.
On September 29, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and conveyed that the Board was evaluating DuPont’s
proposal and would respond after reviewing the Company’s strategic plan at the Board’s regularly scheduled meeting
on October 6, 2021 and after further discussions with the Company’s financial and legal advisors.
On September 30, 2021, Mr. Breen sent a confirmatory letter to Mr. Hoechner outlining his proposal for acquiring the
Company for $240 per share. This letter was shared with the Rogers Board and representatives from Covington and
J.P. Morgan.
On October 5, 2021, J.P. Morgan provided the Company its relationship disclosure letter.
On October 6, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in Chandler, Arizona.
The Board convened initially, joined by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Ram Mayampurath, Chief Technology
Officer, Bob Daigle, Mr. Knoll and a representative of Covington. The Board discussed the proposal from DuPont and
Mr. Hoechner’s communications with Mr. Breen to date. Mr. Hoechner reviewed his recent exchanges with Mr. Breen
and summarized the current status of their discussions, including the request from DuPont for preliminary due
diligence. Mr. Knoll and a representative of Covington reviewed the Board’s duties of care and loyalty. The Board
considered J.P. Morgan’s relationship disclosure letter and discussed whether acquaintance relationships between
Mr. Breen and Company directors Mr. Wallace and Jeff Owens and ownership by various directors of modest
amounts of DuPont stock presented a conflict of interest for consideration of a potential transaction between the
Company and DuPont. Following discussion, the Board determined that these matters did not present conflicts of
interest that would impair independent or impartial judgments regarding a potential transaction with DuPont.
The Board then invited other members of management, together with management’s business advisors, to join the
meeting as part of the Company’s ordinary course strategic planning process, including consideration of an updated
five-year strategic plan and financial forecast. Management’s presentations included specific business segment and
global operations strategies, highlighting growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity requirements, personnel and
capabilities requirements, and associated financial and capital needs. The Board discussed the strategic plan with
management in detail and expressed support for the plan.
The Board excused the business advisors and members of management, except Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath and
Knoll. The Board then discussed the risks and opportunities reflected in the Company’s strategic plan in the context
of DuPont’s proposal.
The Board then invited representatives of J.P. Morgan to join the meeting. The J.P. Morgan representatives discussed
DuPont’s proposal and presented a preliminary financial analysis of the Company based upon the Company’s
strategic plan. The J.P. Morgan representatives also discussed various strategies for engaging in further discussions
with DuPont, and the possibility of contacting a limited number of other potential acquirers on a confidential basis at
a later point, if discussions with DuPont were to progress further. The J.P. Morgan representatives also discussed the
importance of a non-disclosure and standstill agreement with DuPont, should the Board decide to authorize further
discussions with DuPont. Throughout this discussion, the Board asked questions of J.P. Morgan, Covington and
Company management including regarding DuPont’s track record of acquisitions, expected and potential synergies
and their implication on potential purchase price, how DuPont regards the Company’s fit with DuPont’s business
strategy, regulatory approval risks for a transaction, and risks to the Company of pursuing or not pursuing a
transaction with DuPont.
Following these considerations, the Board assessed that a transaction with DuPont at an appropriate value would
enhance the Company’s ability to realize the opportunities reflected in its strategic plan. The Board determined that
further discussions with DuPont under a satisfactory non-disclosure and standstill agreement could be constructive
if DuPont first presented a substantially higher offer. The Board determined that the $240 per share proposal from
DuPont was inadequate, including in light of the expected value of the Company to be realized upon the execution of
the Company’s strategic plan. The Board authorized Mr. Hoechner to contact Mr. Breen on October 8 following the
Company’s expected public announcement of a pending acquisition for the purpose of inviting Mr. Breen to improve
DuPont’s offer.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
To facilitate the Board’s oversight of any further engagement with DuPont, the Board adopted resolutions creating an
Executive Committee of the Board to which Helene Simonet, Mr. Barnes, Mr. Hoechner, Mr. Moorthy and Mr. Wallace
were appointed, with Mr. Wallace serving as its chair.
On October 8, 2021, the Company issued a press release announcing its acquisition of Silicon Engineering Ltd., a
European manufacturer of silicone material solutions. After the press release was issued, Mr. Breen contacted Mr.
Hoechner to congratulate the Company on the acquisition. Mr. Hoechner advised Mr. Breen that the Board had
considered DuPont’s proposal for an acquisition of the Company at $240 per share. Mr. Hoechner further explained
that although the Board recognized the possible advantages stemming from a potential combination between the
Company and DuPont, the Board unanimously rejected DuPont’s proposal, which the Board did not view as being
acceptable or adequate as a basis for the Company and DuPont to engage in further discussions. Mr. Hoechner
communicated to Mr. Breen the Board’s confidence in the Company’s strategic plan. Mr. Breen acknowledged the
Company’s position and advised that DuPont would reflect on the matter and respond promptly.
Later on October 8, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and delivered a proposal contemplating the purchase by
DuPont of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $250 per share. Mr. Hoechner indicated that he
expected the Board would require a substantially higher price, but stated that he would take the revised offer to the
Board for its consideration.
On October 9, 2021, the Executive Committee of the Board held a meeting by videoconference to discuss the most
recent proposal from DuPont. All other members of the Board also participated in the Executive Committee meeting
along with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Covington. The
Executive Committee discussed the proposal with members of senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and
Executive Committee discussed the proposal with members of senior management, representatives of J.P. Morgan and
representatives of Covington. After careful consideration, the Board determined that the proposal from DuPont was
inadequate.
Later on October 9, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to convey that the Board viewed the most recent
proposal from DuPont as not being adequate and invited Mr. Breen to offer a higher price. Later that day, Mr. Breen
contacted Mr. Hoechner and advised that DuPont could not increase its offer without access to certain due diligence
information.
On October 10, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference and Mr. Hoechner briefed the
Committee regarding his recent conversations with Mr. Breen. All other members of the Board also participated in the
Executive Committee meeting along with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P.
Morgan and Covington. Mr. Hoechner informed the Board that while he thought it would be possible for DuPont to
improve its $250 per share offer, he believed, based on the position Mr. Breen had conveyed in their most recent
discussion, that DuPont would be unlikely to do so without access to confidential information. Following
discussions, the Executive Committee resolved to authorize Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Knoll to negotiate and enter into a
non-disclosure and standstill agreement with DuPont and thereafter to provide such limited non-public information
as necessary to facilitate a revised proposal from DuPont. The Executive Committee also formally approved the
engagement of J.P. Morgan as financial advisor.
Later on October 10, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and both parties agreed that, subject to prior execution
of a mutually satisfactory non-disclosure and standstill agreement, representatives from DuPont would have further
meetings with members of the Company’s senior management in Arizona. Mr. Knoll sent a draft non-disclosure and
standstill agreement to DuPont’s General Counsel, Erik Hoover.
On October 11, 2021, Mr. Breen and Mr. Hoechner held discussions regarding the terms and duration of the
Company’s proposed non-disclosure and standstill agreement. Mr. Breen indicated that DuPont would not be willing
to agree to a standstill without a better understanding of the per share price range in which the Company Board
would be willing to permit substantive engagement with DuPont in connection with a potential acquisition. Later that
same day, Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Breen discussed the valuation of the Company further. During the course of the
discussion, Mr. Breen enquired whether the Board was seeking a significantly higher valuation and whether that
could be as high as $270 per share. Mr. Hoechner indicated that while he was not authorized to provide a specific
range at which the Board would consider engaging in further discussions, Mr. Hoechner believed, that, based on
prior discussions with the Board, the Board would require a price of more than $270 per share in order to proceed with
discussions regarding a possible transaction. Mr. Hoechner urged Mr. Breen to use the opportunity to evaluate the
Company’s strategic plan under the terms of a non-disclosure and standstill agreement and was convinced that Mr.
Breen would then see the rationale in the Board’s expectations for a higher valuation for the Company. Mr. Breen
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreed to executing a non-disclosure and standstill agreement to evaluate the strategic plan and reassess his
proposal. Mr. Breen requested that DuPont be allowed to share any financials and strategic plans offered by the
Company with certain potential financing sources. Mr. Hoechner advised that he would consider the request and
discuss it with the Board and the Company’s advisors.
On October 12, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference and Mr. Hoechner provided an
update on his conversations with Mr. Breen and the ongoing negotiations regarding a non-disclosure and standstill
agreement. All other members of the Board, except for Mr. Owens, also participated in the Executive Committee
meeting along with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Covington. Mr.
Knoll explained the status of negotiations, and the Executive Committee determined that a one-year standstill would
be acceptable, but that it was premature to permit DuPont to share confidential information with financing sources.
Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to communicate the Executive Committee’s decision and later that evening,
counsel for DuPont and the Company concluded negotiations of a non-disclosure and standstill agreement that the
parties executed on the morning of October 13, 2021.
On October 13, 2021, members of the Company’s senior management held meetings with representatives of DuPont in
Tempe, Arizona to present elements of the Company’s financial forecast, operating plan and strategic plan, and to
respond to due diligence questions.
On October 15, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner and delivered a proposal contemplating the purchase by
DuPont of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $260 per share, subject to an appropriate due diligence
review by DuPont. Mr. Breen advised Mr. Hoechner that there was sound justification for the increased offer based
upon the information conveyed at the October 13, 2021, meeting, in particular the Company’s customer design wins
and forecasts in the areas of EV/HEV and ADAS.
Later on October 15, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference to discuss the most recent
proposal from DuPont. All other members of the Board also participated in the Executive Committee meeting along
with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Covington. Representatives of
J.P. Morgan provided a preliminary financial analysis of the proposal and potential price that DuPont could offer
consistent with its published acquisition criteria. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also discussed potential negotiation
strategies, intended to assess whether DuPont would be willing to offer a price that the Board could determine to be
acceptable. In light of confidentiality concerns, the Board concluded that it would be premature to contact other
potential acquirers prior to DuPont offering a price that the Board would approve. After considering the most recent
proposal from DuPont, the Board rejected DuPont’s $260 per share proposal as inadequate. The Board authorized Mr.
Hoechner to contact Mr. Breen to propose an acquisition price of $285 per share, subject to the negotiation of an
appropriate definitive transaction agreement.
On October 16, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen and informed him of the Board’s rejection of an offer at $260
per share and the Board’s intention to terminate further discussions if DuPont declined to offer a substantially higher
price.
On October 17, 2021, Mr. Breen contacted Mr. Hoechner to discuss the valuation of the Company and to deliver a
proposal contemplating the purchase by DuPont of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $270 per
share. After conferring with Mr. Wallace, Mr. Hoechner later contacted Mr. Breen and advised that the Board would
support a transaction at an acquisition price of $285 per share, subject to an acceptable definitive transaction
agreement.
On October 18, 2021, Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Breen held a telephonic meeting where Mr. Hoechner informed Mr. Breen
that the Board would not agree to the $270 per share offer. During the discussion, Mr. Breen inquired whether an offer
of $277 per share would be considered by the Board. At this point, Mr. Hoechner said he would discuss that per
share price with Mr. Wallace.
Later on October 18, 2021, Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Wallace held a telephonic meeting with Mr. Breen. During the
meeting, Mr. Breen reiterated DuPont’s strong interest in a transaction. Mr. Breen further communicated DuPont’s
intention, should a transaction be agreed to and completed, to integrate the Company’s business, including certain
operations facilities and functions, as a key component of DuPont’s Electronics & Industrial business segment, with
synergies generally focused on public company costs and administrative functions. Mr. Breen further explained that,
although he did not yet have authority from the DuPont board for an offer of more than $275 per share, if the
Company’s Board, pursuant to a recommendation by Mr. Hoechner and Mr. Wallace, would be willing to accept
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
$277 per share, Mr. Breen would seek approval from the DuPont board for that price. Messrs. Hoechner and Wallace
advised Mr. Breen that they would recommend DuPont’s conditional proposal of $277 per share to the Company’s
Board, subject to an appropriate definitive transaction agreement.
On October 19, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference, where Mr. Hoechner discussed Mr.
Breen’s conditional offer of $277 per share. All other members of the Board also participated in the Executive
Committee meeting along with Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and
Covington. Representatives of J.P. Morgan discussed the offer in the context of J.P. Morgan’s preliminary financial
analysis of the Company and compared the offer to similar, consummated transactions. The Executive Committee
asked questions of the J.P. Morgan representatives who further discussed the proposal from DuPont. The Executive
Committee discussed the impact of accepting the offer on the Company’s various constituencies, including DuPont’s
future plans for the Company and its business divisions. The Executive Committee, in consultation with
representatives from J.P. Morgan and Covington, also discussed the possibility of conducting a market check and the
risks to the Company of sharing confidential information with other potential acquirers. The Executive Committee
considered DuPont’s proposal; the opportunities and risks inherent in the Company’s strategic plan, with the
resulting valuation; the commitment, capabilities and resources of DuPont to grow the Company’s business and
mitigate those risks; and the fact that DuPont was not a direct competitor of the Company. The Executive Committee
concluded that the updated conditional proposal from DuPont, if confirmed by DuPont, should be accepted and
resolved to approve the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement at a price of $277 per share. The Executive
Committee further concluded, after considering the likelihood of potential competing bidders and the risk of leaks and
delays, not to contact third parties to solicit alternative proposals at that time. In addition, at DuPont’s request, the
Board approved Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., or an affiliate, as an approved DuPont financing source with which
DuPont could share confidential information about the Company under the non-disclosure and standstill agreement.
Representatives of Covington then presented to the Executive Committee an overview of the key terms to be
negotiated in a merger agreement as well as an illustrative timeline for a transaction. The Executive Committee asked
questions of Covington, discussed various aspects of the merger agreement, and then directed the Company’s senior
management to proceed with the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement providing for the purchase by DuPont
of all outstanding Company capital stock at a price of $277 per share.
Later on October 19, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to inform Mr. Breen that the Board had approved
engaging with DuPont at a price of $277 per share, subject to approval of such proposal by the DuPont board and
negotiation of an acceptable definitive merger agreement. Later on October 19, 2021 Mr. Breen contacted Mr.
Hoechner to inform him that DuPont was willing to proceed with negotiation of a merger agreement at a price of $277
per share. Messrs. Hoechner and Breen also discussed the organization of due diligence efforts as well as
coordination amongst the parties’ legal advisors. Mr. Breen informed Mr. Hoechner that Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), legal counsel to DuPont in connection with the acquisition, would furnish
Covington with a draft merger agreement.
On October 21, 2021, representatives of Covington received a draft merger agreement from Skadden. The provisions
of the draft merger agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants for transactions of this
nature, provisions enabling the Board to evaluate superior proposals and change its recommendation to the
Company’s shareholders with respect to the transaction in compliance with its fiduciary duties, and a proposed
termination fee payable by the Company of $185 million.
On October 21, 2021, the Company and its representatives organized and began preparing a virtual data room for
DuPont and its representatives to conduct due diligence.
On October 22, 2021, representatives of DuPont met with representatives of the Company in Tempe, Arizona to
discuss additional diligence, including regarding potential synergies.
On October 23, 2021, members of the Company’s senior management, Covington and J.P. Morgan held a meeting by
videoconference to discuss the draft merger agreement. Key issues centered around (i) enhancing deal certainty for
the Company by strengthening DuPont’s obligations to obtain regulatory approval and modify the definition of
“Material Adverse Effect” as it pertained to closing conditions, (ii) facilitating the Company’s ability to consider a
superior proposal, including by lowering the termination fee, and (iii) protecting the Company’s ability and flexibility
to execute on its strategic plan and other interim operations, including employee compensation matters, pending
completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement. Later that evening, Covington provided Skadden
with a revised draft of the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On October 24, 2021, the Executive Committee held a meeting by videoconference to discuss the draft merger
agreement. All other members of the Board also participated in the Executive Committee meeting along with Messrs.
Daigle, Mayampurath, and Knoll and Benjamin Buckley, Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer of the
Company. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Covington also participated. Representatives of Covington reviewed
and discussed with the Executive Committee the proposed merger structure and provisions involving deal certainty,
deal protection, interim operating covenants, employee compensation matters, director and officer indemnification
and dispute resolution, among other matters. Mr. Buckley advised the Executive Committee on employee
compensation matters in connection with the draft merger agreement, explaining that management’s goals were to
retain key Company personnel to execute on the Company’s operating and strategic plans and preserve the
Company’s flexibility to respond appropriately to challenges that may arise in the interim period before closing of the
transaction. Mr. Buckley also discussed a proposed key employee retention plan (“KERP”) being prepared by the
Company’s senior management together with Covington. Mr. Buckley also advised the Executive Committee
regarding the treatment of the Company’s existing benefit and severance plans outside the KERP, as well as efforts to
assess potential issues arising from Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and the potential implications for
executive retention. The Executive Committee asked questions of Mr. Buckley, members of senior Company
management and Covington, and discussed how best to effectuate the goals of employee retention. The Executive
Committee then directed management of the Company and Covington to negotiate for robust protections and
flexibility for the Company during the interim period.
Over the course of the next week, from October 25, 2021 to October 29, 2021, the Company, DuPont and their
respective counsel and advisors conducted several due diligence telephonic meetings to discuss topics including
intellectual property, information technology, human resources and other operational, financial, legal, tax,
environmental, health and safety matters and conducted in-person site visits at three of the Company's significant
manufacturing sites. The Company developed internal and external communications and investor relations strategies
in connection with the pending transaction.
On October 25, 2021, representatives of the Company, Covington, DuPont and Skadden held a meeting by
videoconference to further negotiate provisions of the draft merger agreement. Discussions focused on regulatory
approval covenants and conditions, the termination fee, employee retention protections and the evaluation of
superior proposals. Subsequent to the meeting, on October 27, 2021, Skadden provided Covington with an updated
draft of the merger agreement.
On October 29, 2021, Mr. Hoechner contacted Mr. Breen to discuss employee retention matters. Mr. Hoechner
conveyed to Mr. Breen the Board’s desire to ensure that the Company maintain its essential personnel in the event
that the transaction is not consummated, as well as to preserve value for DuPont by continuing to execute on the
growth strategies through and after closing. Mr. Hoechner discussed for the merger agreement to allow for the
Company to recognize anticipated actual performance under outstanding PSUs, grant performance-based stock unit
awards consistent with the Company’s past practices and indemnify employees from Section 280G exposure.
Later on October 29, 2021, Mr. Hoechner, Mr. Breen and members of management of the Company and DuPont met to
discuss internal and external communications matters. The parties also continued to discuss and negotiate employee
retention matters. DuPont agreed to the Company’s request that employee retention mechanisms be provided for in
the merger agreement. Subsequently, Covington and Skadden exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and the
Company’s disclosure letter.
On October 30, 2021, Covington provided to the Board of the Company materials summarizing key terms of the merger
agreement and describing issues and developments in the negotiations.
On October 31, 2021, the Board held a meeting by videoconference. All Company directors attended together with
Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, Knoll and Buckley and representatives of Covington and J.P. Morgan. Mr. Hoechner
summarized recent developments in the proposed transaction between the Company and DuPont and Mr. Knoll
provided an update on due diligence, legal and communications matters. The Board reviewed minutes of the recent
meetings of the Board and Executive Committee. Mr. Knoll and representatives of Covington then provided an
update on the negotiations with DuPont regarding the terms of the definitive merger agreement and discussed the
summary of key terms, focusing on issues pertaining to the Board’s ability to consider superior proposals, deal
certainty and interim operating flexibility. Mr. Buckley presented management’s recommendation for establishing the
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
KERP, and following discussion, the members of the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board voted
to approve the KERP. Later in the evening of October 31, 2021, representatives of the Company, Covington, DuPont
and Skadden met by videoconference to negotiate and resolve open issues on the Merger Agreement pertaining to
deal certainty and termination provisions.
During the day on November 1, 2021, Covington and Skadden exchanged further drafts of the Merger Agreement and
the Company disclosure letter.
That evening, an unauthorized media report speculated that DuPont and the Company were in advanced negotiations
with respect to a sale of the Company at a price of approximately $275.00 per share. The closing stock price of
Company capital stock on November 1, 2021 was $208.23.
Later in the evening on November 1, 2021, the Board held a meeting by videoconference to consider approving the
merger agreement and related matters. All Company directors, Messrs. Daigle, Mayampurath, Knoll and Buckley and
representatives of Covington and J.P. Morgan attended the meeting. Mr. Hoechner summarized recent developments
in the discussions between the Company and DuPont, including the planning for coordinated internal and external
communications regarding the possible transaction and negotiation of the definitive merger agreement. Mr. Knoll and
representatives of Covington then provided an update on due diligence, legal and communications matters. Mr. Knoll
and Covington further advised that the parties were in a position to sign the definitive merger agreement, subject to
the approval of the Board.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Board J.P. Morgan’s financial analysis of the Merger Consideration.
J.P. Morgan then rendered its oral opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of
November 1, 2021 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger
Consideration of $277.00 per share in cash, without interest therein, to be paid to the holders of shares of Company
capital stock in the proposed merger with DuPont was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders.
The Board considered the fairness opinion and such other matters as the Board deemed appropriate to enable the
Board to evaluate the merger and reach an informed conclusion as to the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.
Following this consideration and the foregoing discussions, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger
Agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, were fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and the Company’s shareholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the
Merger Agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in accordance with the
requirements of the MBCA, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company’s shareholders vote to approve the
Merger Agreement and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for
approval at a special meeting of the Company’s shareholders.
Thereafter, late in the evening of November 1, 2021, the parties executed the merger agreement.
On the morning of November 2, 2021, each of the Company and DuPont issued a press release announcing the
execution of the merger agreement.

At a meeting held on November 1, 2021, the Board, by a unanimous vote of all directors, determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and the Company’s shareholders, and declared it advisable, for the Company to enter
into the Merger Agreement, adopted the Merger Agreement and approved the execution, delivery and performance
of the Merger Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the merger, and resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders
of the Company.
31TABLE OF CONTENTS
Before making its recommendation, the Board consulted with its outside legal and financial advisors and with the
Company’s senior management team. In reaching its recommendation, the Board focused on a number of factors,
including the following:
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration of $277.00 per share in cash to be received by the Company’s
shareholders represented a significant premium across a number of measuring periods, including a premium
of 33% over the $208.23 closing price of the Company’s capital stock on November 1, 2021 (the last trading
day prior to the public announcement of the merger) and a 46% premium to the one-month volume
weighted average share price of $189.74;
•
the Board’s belief that the certainty provided by the acquisition of the Company by Parent for $277.00 per
share in cash was more favorable to Company shareholders than the potential risk-weighted value of
remaining an independent public company, which belief was informed by its evaluation of the Company’s
short-, medium- and long-term prospects were it to remain an independent public company and pursue its
growth strategy, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such strategy, including those
inherent in the Company’s inflecting growth opportunities (including resources, capacity expansion and
historic capital and operational expenditures) and the current and prospective business environment in
which the Company operates, including international, national and local economic conditions and the
competitive and regulatory environments;
•
the Board’s belief, based on the historical and projected financial information concerning the Company’s
business, financial performance and condition, results of operations, earnings, competitive position and
prospects as a stand-alone company and the Board’s assessment that the merger would be favorable to the
Company’s shareholders;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration would be paid solely in cash, which provides certainty of value and
immediate liquidity to Company shareholders upon the consummation of the merger;

the potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of the risks to the Company’s business,
operations, assets, operating results, financial condition, competitive position, and industry on the trading
price of the Company’s capital stock;

the extensive negotiations between the Company and Parent over price, including the fact that the
Company was able to obtain as a result of such negotiations a 15.4% increase in the price per share from
the initial Parent proposal at $240.00 per share to the final price of $277.00 per share, and the Board’s belief
that the $277.00 per share price represented the highest price per share that Parent was willing to pay for
the Company’s capital stock, considering the due diligence conducted by Parent and the negotiations
between the parties;
•
the Board’s belief, based on consultation with its financial advisors, that the negotiations with Parent had
resulted in a transaction price, taking into account the Company’s forecasts, at or above the upper end of
applicable valuation methods and that undertaking broader outreach to third parties, which could prove
unsuccessful, would raise undue risk to the Company of potential loss of competitively sensitive
confidential information and key personnel;
•
the financial analyses of J.P. Morgan and its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board
that, as of November 1, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions set forth in its opinion, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the shares of Company capital stock in the proposed
merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders, as more fully described in the section
entitled “The Merger-Opinion of Financial Advisor” beginning on page 35 and the full text of the written
opinion of J.P. Morgan, which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement;

create professional growth opportunities for many of the Company’s employees;

the Board’s belief, based on discussions between the Company and Parent and Parent’s product portfolio
and transaction history, that the Company’s customers will benefit from Parent’s complementary product
offerings and its greater resources and capabilities to expand the business of the Company as part of
Parent;
•
the fact that the merger is not subject to a financing condition, and that Parent has represented to the
Company in the Merger Agreement, and has provided to the Company the Bridge Financing Letter (as
defined below under Financing of the Merger), that it will have sufficient financial resources at the closing
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and to consummate the merger;

the Board’s consideration of Parent’s industry reputation, its capacity to complete an acquisition of this
size, and its prior track record of completing acquisitions;

the fact that Parent would be obligated to pay a termination fee of $162.5 million to the Company if certain
regulatory approvals are not received and the fact that the termination fee of $135.0 million payable by the
Company to Parent in certain circumstances was viewed by the Board, after consultation with its advisors,
as reasonable and not likely to preclude any other party from making a competing acquisition proposal;

the review by the Board with its advisors of the structure of the proposed merger and the financial and
other terms of the Merger Agreement, including the parties’ representations, warranties and covenants, the
conditions to their respective obligations and the termination provisions as well as the likelihood of

necessary to complete the merger. The Board also considered the following specific aspects of the Merger
Agreement:
•
the Company’s right to engage in negotiations with, and provide information to, a third party that
makes an unsolicited written bona fide proposal relating to an alternative proposal, if the Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that
such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal;
•
the right of the Board to change its recommendation to Company shareholders to vote “FOR” the
Merger Agreement proposal if a Superior Proposal is available or an Intervening Event has occurred,
subject to certain conditions; and
•
the fact that Parent agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the merger and obtain
required regulatory approvals, including agreeing to make divestitures and accept other regulatory
remedies reasonably necessary, proper or advisable so as to permit the consummation of the merger
so long as such remedies do not impose a Burdensome Effect (as described in the section entitled
“Summary of the Merger Agreement-Cooperation and Efforts to Consummate”).
The Board weighed these advantages and opportunities against a number of potentially negative factors in its
deliberations concerning the Merger Agreement and the merger, including:
•
the fact that the Company would no longer exist as an independent public company following the merger
and that Company shareholders would forgo any future increase in the Company’s value following the
merger that might result from the Company’s short-, medium- and long-term prospects were it to remain an
independent public company;
•
the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the
merger will be satisfied, and as a result there can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, even if
the merger is approved by the Company’s shareholders;
•
the fact that, if the merger is not completed, (i) the Company will have incurred significant risk, transaction
expenses and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to its operations, diversion of
management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our business
and customer relationships, (ii) depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be
completed, the price of the Company’s capital stock could decline, potentially significantly, and (iii) the
market’s perception of the Company’s prospects could be adversely affected;

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement, “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and

ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,Opinion of Financial Advisor,"Opinion of Financial Advisor
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 11, 2021, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in
connection with the proposed merger.
At the meeting of the Board on November 1, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to
be paid to the holders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such shareholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its November 1, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written
opinion to the Board, dated November 1, 2021, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
shareholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated November 1, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company’s shareholders are
urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as
such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed merger, was directed only to the
Merger Consideration to be paid in the proposed merger and did not address any other aspect of the proposed
merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration to the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the
Company to engage in the proposed merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness
committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as
to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the
industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the proposed merger with the publicly available financial terms of
certain transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for
such companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of the Company’s capital stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other
companies;
•
reviewed the internal financial forecasts and projections prepared by the management of the Company
relating to its business, which are summarized in the section entitled “The Merger-Financial Projections”
beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
35TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the proposed merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed
necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for
J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify (and did not assume responsibility or liability for
independently verifying) any such information or its accuracy or completeness. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was
not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of
the Company, DuPont or the Merger Sub under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan
assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the
Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts
or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the proposed merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement.
J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, DuPont and Merger Sub in
the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its
analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the
Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the proposed merger will be obtained without any
adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the proposed merger.
The projections furnished to J.P. Morgan and summarized in the section entitled “The Merger-Financial Projections”
beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement were prepared by the Company’s management. The Company does not
publicly disclose the internal management projections provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan’s
analysis of the proposed merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These
projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the
control of the Company’s management. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in the
projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking statements, please refer
to the section entitled “The Merger-Financial Projections” beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that
subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company capital stock in the proposed
merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or the underlying decision by the Company to
engage in the proposed merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature
of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed merger, or any class of
such persons relative to the Merger Consideration in the proposed merger or with respect to the fairness of any such
compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Company’s capital stock will trade at
any future time.
The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm’s length
negotiations between the Company and DuPont, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely
that of the Board. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the
Board in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board
or the Company’s management with respect to the proposed merger or the Merger Consideration.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodology in rendering its opinion to the Board on November 1, 2021 and contained in the presentation delivered
to the Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The summary below does not purport to
be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text
of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the
Company with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses that J.P. Morgan judged to
be analogous to the Company. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., CMC
Materials, Inc., Entegris, Inc., FormFactor, Inc., Graco, Inc., Helios Technologies, Inc., Idex Corporation, II-VI, Inc.,
Ingevity Corporation, Littelfuse, Inc., Nordson Corporation, Quaker Chemical Corporation, Teledyne Technologies
Incorporated, and Wolfspeed, Inc. These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly
traded companies with operations and business that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analyses, may be considered
sufficiently similar to those of the Company based on business sector participation, operational characteristics and
financial metrics. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical to the Company and certain of these
companies have financial and operating characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The
analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently
than they would affect the Company.
For each of the selected companies, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio of firm value to EBITDA based on publicly
available financial information and Wall Street estimates per FactSet Research Systems as of October 29, 2021 for the
2022 calendar year (which we refer to as “CY2022E FV / EBITDA”). For each of the selected companies, J.P. Morgan
also calculated the price to earnings ratio based on publicly available financial information and Wall Street estimates
per FactSet Research Systems as of October 29, 2021 for the 2022 calendar year (which we refer to as “CY2022E P/E”).
Based on the results of these analyses and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a
multiple reference range of 12.0x to 20.0x for CY22E FV / EBITDA and a multiple reference range of 16.5x to 30.0x for
CY22E P/E and applied these reference ranges to the CY2022E EBITDA and CY22E earnings per share, respectively,
as provided by the Company’s management in its management projections. This resulted in an implied equity value
range of $179.00 to $297.00 per share for the CY22E FV / EBITDA analysis and an implied equity value range of
$142.00 to $259.00 per share for the CY22E P/E analysis (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company,
compared, in each case, to (i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00 per share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital
stock on October 29, 2021 of $201.12 per share.
Selected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions
involving companies that engaged in businesses that J.P. Morgan judged to be reasonably analogous to the
business of the Company or aspects thereof. None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the
proposed merger. Certain of these transactions may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the
proposed merger. However, the selected transactions were chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for
purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed merger. The analyses necessarily
involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of
the companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the
proposed merger. For each of the selected transactions, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio of the target company’s firm
value to the public estimates of EBITDA for the last 12-month period prior to the date of announcement (which we
refer to as “LTM FV / EBITDA”). Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the following transactions:

Based on the results of this analysis and other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a
multiple reference range of 11.0x to 19.5x for LTM FV / EBITDA, and applied this reference range to the LTM EBITDA
for the Company as of September 30, 2021, which includes Silicone Engineering, as provided by the Company’s
management in its management projections. This resulted in an implied equity value range of $139.00 to $245.00 per
share (in each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company, compared to (i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00
per share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital stock on October 29, 2021 of $201.12 per share.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of
determining the implied fully diluted equity value per share for the Company’s capital stock. J.P. Morgan calculated
the unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate from Q4 2021 through 2026 based upon
financial projections prepared by the management of the Company, which are summarized in the section entitled “The
Merger-Financial Projections” beginning on page 40 of this proxy statement. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of
terminal asset values of the Company at the end of the six-year period ending in 2026 by applying a perpetual growth
rate ranging from 4.0% to 5.0% of the unlevered free cash flow of the Company during the terminal year of the six-
year period. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal asset values were then discounted to present
values using a range of discount rates from 9.0% to 10.5%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an
analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the unlevered free cash flows
and the range of terminal asset values were then adjusted for the Company’s net cash of $43 million. Based on the
results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan arrived at a range of equity values of between $202.00 and $330.00 per share (in
each case, rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company’s capital stock on a stand-alone basis (i.e., without
synergies).
Other Information.
52-Week Historical Trading Range. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, J.P. Morgan
reviewed the trading range for Company capital stock for the 52-week period ended October 29, 2021. J.P. Morgan
noted that the low and high closing share prices during this period were $116.00 and $214.00 per share of Company
capital stock, respectively.
Analyst Price Targets for the Company. For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analyses, J.P.
Morgan reviewed certain publicly available equity research analyst share price targets adjusted to present value
assuming a cost of equity of 10.5% for Company capital stock, and noted that the range of such price targets,
rounded to the nearest $1.00, was $204.00 to $253.00 per share of Company capital stock, in each case, as compared to
(i) the DuPont offer price of $277.00 per share, and (ii) the closing price of Company capital stock on October 29, 2021
of $201.12 per share.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the
foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of
the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for
analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the
Company. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those
analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses
or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or
negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the
totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.
Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected
companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the selected
transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because
they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may
be considered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their
participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed
merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial
and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies
compared to the Company and the transactions compared to the proposed merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company with respect to the
proposed merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in
connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it operates.
For services rendered in connection with the proposed merger, the Company has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an
aggregate fee of approximately $50 million, $3 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan
delivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent and payable upon the consummation of the proposed
merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its
services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities
arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement.
During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial
or investment banking relationships with the Company and DuPont for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have
received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and
joint bookrunner on the Company’s credit facility in October 2020. Such services during such period for DuPont have
included acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on credit facilities of DuPont in April 2020 and April 2021,
acting as joint lead bookrunner on DuPont’s offering of debt securities in April 2020 and acting as a financial advisor
in connection with the separation of DuPont’s Nutrition and Biosciences business in February 2021 and DuPont’s
acquisition of Laird Performance Materials in July 2021. During the two-year period preceding delivery of J.P.
Morgan’s opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from the Company were approximately $1 million
and from DuPont were approximately $26 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its

ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,Financial Forecasts,"Financial Forecasts
In connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction, we provided projections to our directors and their
advisors in connection with their consideration of the merger, as well as to Parent, in connection with their due
diligence review of the Company. These projections contained certain non-public financial forecasts that were
prepared by our management for fiscal years 2021-2026.
A summary of the financial forecasts included in the projections has been included below. This summary is not being
included in this document to influence your decision whether to vote for or against the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement, but is being included because these financial forecasts were made available to our directors and
their advisors as well as to Parent. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that our
directors or their advisors, or any other person, considered, or now considers, such financial forecasts to be material
or to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, and these forecasts should not be relied upon as such. Our
internal financial forecasts, upon which the summary financial forecasts included below were based, are subjective in
many respects. There can be no assurance that these financial forecasts will be realized or that actual results will not
be significantly higher or lower than forecasted.
39TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, the financial forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the
use of non-GAAP financial measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither our independent
registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have audited, compiled, examined or
performed any procedures with respect to the financial forecasts contained herein, nor have they expressed any
opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.
These financial forecasts were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may
be beyond our control, including demand, supply (including price and availability of raw materials), competition,
resources, capacity expansion execution, the general business and economic environment, and conditions in the
advanced materials industry and the industries into which the Company’s products are sold. We believe the
assumptions used as a basis for this projected financial information were reasonable, and that the bases on which the
financial forecasts were prepared reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the
future financial performance of the Company, at the time we prepared these financial forecasts, given the information
available at the time. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause these financial forecasts not to be
achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to our business (including our ability to
achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods), industry performance, general business
and economic conditions, the regulatory environment and other factors described in or referenced under
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information” beginning on page 18 and “The Merger-
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board of Directors” beginning on page 31 and those risks and
uncertainties detailed in our public periodic filings with the SEC. In addition, the forecasts also reflect assumptions
that are subject to change and do not reflect revised prospects for our business, changes in general business or
economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not
anticipated at the time the financial forecasts were prepared. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these
financial forecasts will be realized or that our future financial results will not materially vary from these financial
forecasts.
No one has made or makes any representation to any shareholder regarding the information included in the financial
forecasts set forth below. We have made no representation to Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement
concerning these financial forecasts. We do not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose financial forecasts as to
future financial performance, earnings or other results for extended periods due to, among other reasons, the
unpredictability of our business and competitive markets in which we operate, the inherent difficulty of accurately
predicting future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may prove incorrect.
We have not updated and do not intend to update or otherwise revise the financial forecasts to reflect circumstances
existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the
assumptions on which such forecasts were based are shown to be in error. In light of the foregoing factors and the
uncertainties inherent in these projections, shareholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on these
projections.
The following is a summary of the financial forecasts for the Company prepared by our management and provided to
our directors and their advisors:

Parent estimates that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions, including to
pay fees and expenses in connection with the merger, is approximately $5.2 billion. Parent has obtained delayed draw
term loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $5.2 billion (the “Commitments”) to finance the merger
and related transactions on the terms set forth in that certain Term Credit Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2021
(the “Credit Agreement”), among Parent, as borrower, the lenders party thereto (collectively, the “Term Lenders”) and
Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”).
Commitments under the Credit Agreement will be available from November 22, 2021 until the earliest to occur of (a)
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) after the Outside Date, including any extension thereof pursuant to the Merger
Agreement as in effect on November 1, 2021, (b) the closing of the merger without drawing on the Commitments, (c)
the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent in a signed writing in accordance with its terms, (d) the
receipt by Parent of the proceeds of certain asset sales, equity issuances or debt issuances in an aggregate amount
of $5.2 billion and (e) receipt by the Administrative Agent of written notice from Parent of its election to terminate all
Commitments under the Credit Agreement (such earliest date, the “Commitment Termination Date”). The Credit
Agreement is scheduled to mature on the date that is two years following the closing date of the merger, and shall not
be subject to scheduled amortization. The Credit Agreement is unsecured.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either, at Parent’s option,
LIBOR plus a margin of 0.875% to 1.375% or a base rate plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.375%, depending on the rating of
certain index debt of Parent. The Credit Agreement contains customary hardwired LIBOR replacement provisions.
Parent will pay a ticking fee which shall accrue at a rate per annum ranging from 0.050% to 0.150%, depending on the
rating of certain index debt of Parent, on the daily average amount of the unused commitment of the Term Lenders
during the period from January 30, 2022 to but excluding the Commitment Termination Date or, if earlier, the closing
date of the merger.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, if any, shall be required to be repaid with the proceeds of certain asset sales,
equity issuances or debt issuances, in each case subject to certain customary exceptions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary conditions, representations and warranties, affirmative and negative
covenants (including, without limitation, limitations on liens, fundamental changes, sale lease transactions and ratio
of total indebtedness to total capitalization) for facilities of its type, subject to customary exceptions and thresholds.
The consummation of the merger is not subject to a financing condition (although the funding of the debt financing
is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement).

The closing of the merger will occur on the third business day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of each of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The merger will become effective upon
the filing of Articles of Merger with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the filing of a
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the
Company will agree in writing and will specify in the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger. We intend to
complete the merger as promptly as practicable, subject to receipt of the Requisite Company Vote and satisfaction of
the other closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Although we currently anticipate that the merger will
be completed in the second quarter of 2022, we cannot specify when or assure you that all conditions to the merger

Within three business days after the Effective Time of the merger, a letter of transmittal will be mailed to each holder
of record of the Company’s capital stock describing how such holder should surrender its shares of Company capital
stock for the Merger Consideration.
You should not return your stock certificates, if any, with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your
stock certificates to the exchange agent (described in the section entitled “Summary of the Merger Agreement-
Delivery of Merger Consideration and Procedures for Surrender” beginning on page 58) without a letter of
transmittal.
If your shares of Company capital stock are certificated, you will not be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
until you deliver a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent and you must also
surrender your stock certificate or certificates to the exchange agent. If your shares of Company capital stock are held
in book-entry form, which we refer to as uncertificated shares, surrender of any uncertificated shares will be effected
in accordance with the exchange agent’s customary procedures with respect to securities that are uncertificated or
represented by book-entry and no holder of uncertificated shares will be required to deliver a certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the exchange agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder
is otherwise entitled under the Merger Agreement.
If you have lost a certificate, or if it has been stolen or destroyed, then before you will be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration, you will have to make an affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction and, if reasonably required
by Parent, post a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent with respect to such certificate. These procedures will be described in the
letter of transmittal that you will receive, which you should read carefully in its entirety.

In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that the
Company’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of our shareholders generally, as more fully described below. The Board was aware of these interests
and considered them, among other matters, in reaching the determination that the Merger Agreement and the merger
are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and in making their recommendations regarding
approval of the Merger Agreement as described in the section entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Board of Directors” beginning on page 31.

ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,Certain Assumptions,"Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payment and benefits described in this section,
the following assumptions, as well as those described in the footnotes to the table titled “The Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation” below, were used:
•
the relevant price per share of Company capital stock is $277.00 per share, which is the per share Merger
Consideration;
•
the effective time of the merger is April 1, 2022, which is the assumed date of the effective time of the
merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section (the “Assumed Effective Time”);
•
the employment of each executive officer is terminated without “cause” (as such term is defined in the
Rogers Corporation Severance Plan (the “Severance Plan”)), in each case immediately following the
Assumed Effective Time;
•
prior to the Assumed Effective time, the Company makes equity grants (i.e., Post-Signing Company RSUs)
in the ordinary course of business;
•
any Post-Signing Company RSUs that are granted to the executives in accordance with the preceding
assumption are subject to double-trigger vesting, under which such Post-Signing Company RSUs that are
outstanding as of the Assumed Effective Time would accelerate and vest one-third upon a qualifying
termination after the Assumed Effective Time and before the one-year anniversary of the grant date; and,
42TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the executive officers will be entitled to make-whole payments under the Gross-Up Agreement (as defined
below) for excise taxes incurred under Section 4999 of the Code imposed on payments made in connection
with the merger, based upon the Assumed Effective Time.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not occur or be accurate
on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain events that are not
expected, such as the termination of employment of the executive officers prior to the Assumed Effective Time.
Interests with Respect to Company Equity
Treatment of Company Stock Awards
At the Assumed Effective Time and in accordance with the assumptions described in the section entitled “The
Merger-Certain Assumptions” beginning on page 42:
•
each Company deferred stock unit or Company RSU award, excluding Post-Signing Company RSUs, that is
then outstanding and unvested will become fully vested and will automatically be canceled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the
number of shares of Company capital stock subject to such Company RSU, on the terms set forth in the
Merger Agreement;
•
one-third of the shares of Company capital stock underlying each Post-Signing Company RSU, excluding
any such Company RSU granted to a non-employee director, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Assumed Effective Time will vest and will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and such number of shares of
Company capital stock, and the remainder of each such Post-Signing Company RSU will be forfeited
without consideration; and
•
each Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will become fully
vested and will automatically be canceled and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of Shares subject to such Company PSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time based on 120% of the target level of performance achievement, on
the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Any offering period that commenced prior to November 1, 2021 shall end as of a date selected by the Company prior
to the Effective Time of the merger, and each outstanding right to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company
granted under such plan will be automatically exercised as of that date. Until the merger is effective or the Merger
Agreement is terminated, no new offering period may commence under the ESPP.
Treatment of Director Deferred Stock Units
Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the merger, each of our directors will terminate his service as
a member of the Board and, in connection therewith, each director who holds deferred stock units will receive an
equivalent number of shares of our capital stock in accordance with his deferral elections. Each such share of capital
stock issued in settlement of the director’s deferred stock units will be treated as an outstanding share at the time of
the merger and will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Severance Arrangements; Compensatory Arrangements Relating to the Merger
Pursuant to (i) the Severance Plan or the Severance Pay Plan Policy for Exempt, Non-Exempt, Non-Union Hourly and
Part-Time Employees (the “Severance Pay Plan Policy”), as applicable, (ii) the restricted stock unit award agreements
into which the Company has entered or may enter into with each of its executive officers under the Company’s 2019
Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan (the “2019 plan”), and (iii) the performance-based share unit award agreements
into which the Company has entered with each of its executive officers under the 2019 plan, certain of the Company’s
executive officers are entitled to specified benefits in the event of the termination of their employment under specified
circumstances, including a termination following a change in control of the Company.
The Company and each of Messrs. Hoechner, Mayampurath, Daigle, Knoll, and Gouveia (collectively, the “covered
named executive officers” or “covered NEOs”) are parties to the Severance Plan. In order to participate in the
Severance Plan, each executive must execute a participation agreement (the “Participation Agreement”) providing
that severance payments and benefits provided under the Severance Plan are in lieu of any other severance
payments or benefits to which they would have been entitled from the Company.
The Severance Plan provides benefits to a covered NEO if that NEO (i) is involuntarily terminated by the Company
for any reason other than for cause or (ii) terminates his employment with the Company for good reason (each a
“Qualifying Termination”). Benefits under the Severance Plan include:
•
for Mr. Hoechner, a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (A) his base salary for the Severance
Period (as defined below), and (B) his target annual bonus, annualized over the duration of the Severance
Period. If the Qualifying Termination does not occur within two years after a change in control, the
Severance Period is 24 months. If the Qualifying Termination occurs within two years of a change in
control, the Severance Period is 30 months.
•
for covered NEOs other than Mr. Hoechner, a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (A) his base
salary for the Severance Period (as defined below), and (B) if the Qualifying Termination occurs within one
year of a change in control or before the third anniversary of the covered NEO’s participation in the
Severance Plan, his target annual bonus, annualized over the duration of the Severance Period. If the
Qualifying Termination does not occur within one year after a change in control, the Severance Period is 12
months. If the Qualifying Termination occurs within one year of a change in control, the Severance Period
is 24 months (with respect to Messrs. Daigle and Knoll) or 18 months (with respect to Messrs. Gouveia and
Mayampurath);
•
subsidized premium payments for continuation of medical and dental insurance coverage following the
Qualifying Termination for (A) 12 months, or (B) for Mr. Hoechner or if the Qualifying Termination occurs
within one year after a change in control, 18 months; and
•
reasonable outplacement services (with a value not to exceed $50,000) during (A) the 12-month period (24-
month period for Mr. Hoechner) immediately following the Qualifying Termination, or (B) if the Qualifying
Termination occurs within one year after a change in control, the 24-month period (30-month period for Mr.
Hoechner, but not beyond the end of the second calendar year after the Qualifying Termination)
immediately following the Qualifying Termination.
The Severance Plan also provides benefits to our non-NEO executive officers and certain other officers of the
Company, under the same conditions set forth above. Benefits under the Severance Plan for these executives and
other officers are the same as those provided to Messrs. Gouveia and Mayampurath.
Certain other officers of the Company are entitled to benefits under the Severance Pay Plan Policy if they are
involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause. Benefits under the Severance Pay Plan Policy include:
•
a lump-sum cash payment equal to six months of the individual’s base salary; and
•
six months of subsidized premium payments for continuation of medical and dental insurance coverage
following termination, which the Company may elect to pay in a lump-sum cash payment.
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Benefits under the severance plans are also conditioned (i) in the case of the Severance Plan, upon the executive’s
execution and non-revocation of a general release and separation agreement and compliance with covenants
regarding non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement, and confidentiality, and (ii) in the case of the
Severance Pay Plan Policy, upon the executive's execution of a general release and settlement agreement. The
estimated aggregate amount of severance payments that would be payable to our executive officers who are not
named executive officers under the severance plans upon the closing of the merger is $2.8 million.
Key Employee Retention Plan
At the Chief Executive Officer’s discretion, non-NEO executives (as well as other key Company employees) are
eligible to participate in the Rogers Corporation Key Employee Retention Plan (the “KERP”). Benefits under the KERP
include cash-based retention awards, which may be granted in the Chief Executive Officer’s discretion in an
aggregate amount for all participants not to exceed $10 million. The KERP is designed to incentivize the retention of
key talent through the Effective Time or, if earlier, December 31, 2022, in order to promote continuity of Company
operations. Benefits under the KERP vest on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2022, or (ii) an individual’s qualifying
termination. In addition, if the Effective Time occurs before either (i) or (ii), 50% of the benefit would vest at the
Effective Time, and the remainder would vest on the earlier of (i) or (ii). As of the date of this proxy statement, no
awards or benefits have been allocated or granted under the KERP to any non-NEO executives.
Pension Restoration Plan
Rogers previously maintained the Rogers Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan, a tax-qualified defined benefit
pension plan, and currently maintains a non-qualified unfunded pension plan (the “Pension Restoration Plan”).
Benefit accrual under both plans ceased as of June 30, 2013. Benefits under the Pension Restoration Plan are only
payable in a lump sum. The lump sum amount is calculated using mortality tables applicable to tax qualified plans
under IRS rules and an interest rate equal to the average of the annual interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes
over the five years (as reported on September 1) prior to the year of employment termination plus 20 basis points. In
general, the benefit under the Pension Restoration Plan is paid six months and one day following the termination of
employment, or, if earlier, the benefit is immediately payable on a change in control.
Rogers Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan
Rogers Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan is maintained for the benefit of our executive officers. An executive
officer may only earn nonqualified deferred compensation by electing to defer receipt of compensation that would
otherwise be payable to him or her in cash. The plan allows participants to elect to defer up to 100% of their annual
bonus and 50% of their base salary. In addition, the Company may, in its discretion, credit amounts to participants'
accounts. Accelerated payment may occur upon a change in control that occurs prior to the executive officer’s
termination of employment with the Company if so elected by the executive officer prior to the executive officer’s
commencement of participation in the plan or a bona fide unforeseen financial hardship. Payments made upon a
participant’s separation from service may be delayed six months, if necessary, to avoid penalties under Internal
Revenue Code Section 409A.
Former Officer
Mr. Michael M. Ludwig retired from his position as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the
Company, effective as of May 1, 2021. Mr. Ludwig had an employment or severance agreement with us prior to the
termination of his employment with the Company. He is not entitled to severance payments from the Company in
connection with the merger and has no economic interests in the merger except insofar as he may hold shares of
Company capital stock.
Tax Reimbursements-Gross-Up Agreement
In connection with the merger, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board authorized the Company
to enter into participation agreements with certain employees, including certain of the Company's executive officers,
and approved the form of such participation agreements (each, a “Gross-Up Agreement”). Each Gross-Up Agreement
provides that if the employee becomes entitled to payments and benefits in connection with the merger, including
accelerated vesting of Company equity awards, that are “excess parachute payments” under Sections 280G and 4999
of the Code, the employee will be entitled to receive an additional payment from the Company in an amount
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
such that, after payment by the employee of all applicable taxes on the parachute payments and this additional
payment (including any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code), the employee will be in the same after-tax
position as if no excise tax were imposed on the parachute payments.
See the section entitled “The Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 48 of this proxy
statement for an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each of the Company's named executive
officers pursuant to each Gross-Up Agreement. Based on the assumptions described in the section entitled “The
Merger-Certain Assumptions” beginning on page 42, the estimated aggregate amount that would become payable to
the Company's executive officers who are not named executive officers under the Gross-Up Agreements is
approximately $3.5 million, and the aggregate of such amount for all employees is approximately $7.1 million.
Potential Acceleration of Payment of Compensation and Benefits
If and to the extent it would reasonably be expected to reduce or eliminate excise taxes that may be imposed under
Section 4999 of the Code on account of parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code, the Company, in
consultation with Parent, may (A) elect to accelerate into 2021 the vesting or payment of compensation and benefits,
including equity awards, that otherwise would have vested or become payable prior to April 1, 2022, assuming
continued employment of the applicable employee, and (B) allocate amounts to restrictive covenants as appropriate
as reasonable compensation for services rendered by an employee after the consummation of the merger. As of the
date of this proxy statement filing, the Company has not decided whether to accelerate any such payments.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers
From and after the Effective Time of the merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of the Merger
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time of the merger a director, manager or officer of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries (an “indemnified party”), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the indemnified party is or was an officer, director, manager, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, is
or was serving at the request of the Company or one of its subsidiaries as an officer, director, manager, employee or
agent of another person, in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time of the merger, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time of the merger, in each
case to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable law. Each
indemnified party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation (without
duplication) within ten business days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the indemnified party of
a request for indemnification; provided that any indemnified party to whom expenses are to be advanced provides
prior to any receipt of such advances an undertaking, to the extent required by the MBCA or other applicable law, to
repay such advances if it is determined by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which
determination is not subject to appeal) that such indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable
law.
For six years following the Effective Time of the merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation have agreed to
maintain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
present and former directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time of the merger as contained in the articles of
organization and bylaws of the Company in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and
rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any indemnified party as provided in the
organizational documents of the Company and its subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such
indemnified party and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on November 1, 2021, shall
survive the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Parent has also agreed to either:
•
maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time of the merger the Company’s existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time of the merger (including the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement), so long as the
annual premiums would not exceed more than 300% of the current annual premium paid for the Company’s
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (the “Maximum Premium”); or
•
purchase a “tail” policy and maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect for six years from the
Effective Time of the merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, prior to the Effective Time of the merger, elect to purchase its own
“tail” policy as long as such “tail” policy does not cost more than the Maximum Premium.
For a more detailed description of these provisions of the Merger Agreement, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Summary of the Merger Agreement-Indemnification and Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance” on
page 69.
Intent to Vote in Favor of the Merger
As of the Record Date, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned and were entitled to
vote, in the aggregate, 220,807 shares of Company capital stock, representing 1.18% of the outstanding shares of
Company capital stock on the Record Date. Each of the directors and executive officers has informed the Company
that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Company capital stock “FOR” the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement, “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute”
compensation and “FOR” the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
Merger Agreement.

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the tables below (and the accompanying footnotes) present the
estimated amounts of compensation that each of the Company’s named executive officers could receive that are
based on or otherwise relate to the merger. Except where otherwise indicated, (i) this compensation relates to prior
contracted agreements and other arrangements, and (ii) no part of this compensation, other than payments under the
Gross-Up Agreements, was conferred as a part of the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute”
compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-
related compensation payable to the Company’s named executive officers. This merger-related compensation is
subject to a nonbinding advisory vote of the Company shareholders, as set forth in Proposal Two to this proxy
statement. For additional information, see the section entitled “Nonbinding Advisory Proposal Regarding “Golden
Parachute” Compensation (Proposal Two)” beginning on page 55.
The amounts set forth below for the named executive officers are estimates of the amounts that would be payable to
the Company’s named executive officers using the assumptions described in the section entitled “The Merger-
Certain Assumptions” beginning on page 42.
The amounts shown in the table are estimates only, are based on assumptions and information available to date. The
actual amounts that may be paid upon an individual’s termination of employment can only be determined at the actual
time of such termination.

the change in the control as follows:
•
Company RSUs -- Reflects the acceleration of portion of Company RSUs outstanding and subject to accelerated
vesting as of the Assumed Effective Time and the automatic cancellation and conversion of such Company RSUs into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares
subject to such Company RSUs immediately prior to the Assumed Effective Time.
•
Company PSUs - Reflects the accelerated vesting as of the Assumed Effective Time and the automatic cancellation

Consideration and the number of shares subject to such Company PSUs based on 120% of the target level of
performance achievement.
•
Post-Signing Company RSUs - Assumes the grant of Post-Signing Company RSUs and the accelerated vesting of one-
third of the shares of Company capital stock underlying each such Post-Signing Company RSU that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Assumed Effective Time and the automatic cancelation and conversion of such Post-
Signing Company RSUs into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration
and such number of shares of Company capital stock.

Based on the assumptions described in the section entitled “The Merger-Certain Assumptions” beginning on page 42, (i) the
estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable to the Company’s executive officers who are not named executive
officers in respect of their unvested Company equity awards is approximately $5.6 million; and (ii) the estimated aggregate
amount that would become payable to the Company’s non-employee directors in respect of their unvested equity awards is
approximately $2.4 million.

Reflects accrued and vested benefits owed to NEOs under the Pension Restoration Plan. The amounts included for Mr. Daigle
reflect the estimated amount of a lump sum payment due upon a change in control under the Pension Restoration Plan. Mr.
Daigle is the only named executive officer entitled to a benefit under such plan. For further details regarding the Pension
Restoration Plan, see “Severance Arrangements; Compensatory Arrangements Relating to the Merger” beginning on page 45.

Consists of the estimated value of continuation coverage of medical and dental insurance benefits for a period of up to 18 months
if the Qualifying Termination occurs within one year after a change in control and the value of outplacement services the
Company would provide to all NEOs.
(7)
Tax reimbursements consisting of make-whole payments under the Gross-Up Agreements reimburse eligible participants,
including the named executive officers, for the excise tax imposed on the payments and benefits made in connection with the
merger to the eligible participants, including the named executive officers, by reason of Section 4999 of the Code. The Gross-Up
Agreements provide that, if an eligible participant will become entitled to payments and benefits in connection with the merger,
including accelerated vesting of Company equity awards, that are “excess parachute payments” under Sections 280G and 4999 of
the Code, the eligible participant will be entitled to receive an additional payment from the Company in an amount such that,
after payment by the individual of all applicable taxes on the parachute payments and this additional payment (including any
excise tax that imposed under Section 4999 of the Code), the individual will be in the same after-tax position as if no excise tax
were imposed on the parachute payments. Based on the stated assumptions, NEOs shown in the table as receiving no gross-up are
not expected to receive payments in an amount that would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code, and therefore would not receive a gross-up payment. For further details regarding the Gross-Up Agreements, see
“Severance Arrangements; Compensatory Arrangements Relating to the Merger” beginning on page 45.

The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders whose
Company capital stock is converted into the right to receive cash in the merger. This discussion is based on the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and
administrative guidance and judicial interpretations thereof, each as in effect as of the date of the merger, and all of
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), or any opinion of counsel with respect to the statements made
and the conclusions reached in the following summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the
views expressed herein or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
This section addresses only U.S. federal income tax and does not discuss any state, local or foreign tax
consequences of the merger. In addition, this summary does not discuss currently proposed tax legislation that may
affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to certain holders if such proposal were enacted in their
current form.
This discussion applies to a holder only if the holder holds its shares of Company capital stock as a “capital asset”
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). It does not address all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of shares in light of its particular
circumstances, or that may apply to a holder subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws,
including, but not limited to, a holder that is a regulated investment company, real estate investment trust,
cooperative, bank or certain other financial institution, insurance company, tax-exempt organization (including a
private foundation), governmental organization, retirement or pension plan, dealer in securities or foreign currency,
trader that uses the mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to its securities, expatriate or former long-term
resident of the United States; a holder that is subject to the alternative minimum tax; a holder that is, or holds shares
through, a partnership, S corporation or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares
as part of a straddle, hedging, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, holds or has held,
directly, indirectly or constructively by attribution, more than 5 percent of the shares, holds shares as qualified small
business stock for purposes of Sections 1045 or 1202 of the Code, exercises appraisal rights in the merger, or received
the shares as compensation, pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options, stock purchase rights or stock
appreciation rights, or as restricted stock, or is a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the
U.S. dollar. In addition, this discussion does not address any tax considerations under state, local or non-U.S. laws or
U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Company capital stock,
the tax treatment of its partners or members generally will depend upon the status of the partner or member and the
activities of the entity or arrangement. Accordingly, such entities or arrangement, and partners or members in such
entities or arrangements, are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income tax
consequences to them of the merger.
50TABLE OF CONTENTS
This discussion of the material U.S. federal tax consequences of the merger to holders of Company capital stock is
for general information only and is not, is not intended to be, and may not be construed as, tax advice to holders of
Company capital stock. Each holder of Company capital stock is urged to consult their or its own tax advisors as to
the applicability and effect of the rules discussed below and the particular tax consequences of the merger,
including the application of the alternative minimum tax and any U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax laws, as
well as the potential effects of any proposed tax legislation, if enacted.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is any beneficial owner of Company capital stock that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a domestic
corporation (or any other entity treated as domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes); (iii) an estate,
the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust, if (A) a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons have authority to
control all of the trust’s substantial decisions or (B) the trust has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The exchange of Company capital stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In general, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for Company capital stock pursuant to the merger will
recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company capital
stock exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. If a U.S. Holder acquired shares of Company capital stock by
purchasing them, the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Company capital stock will generally equal the
amount the U.S. Holder paid for the relevant shares of Company capital stock. Gain or loss will be determined
separately for each block of shares of Company capital stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction) exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. Such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
U.S. Holder’s holding period for such block of shares of Company capital stock exceeds one year at the time of
consummation of the merger, as the case may be. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders,
including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.
Non-corporate U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds
generally are subject to a Medicare tax at a rate of 3.8 percent rate on all or a portion of their net investment income,
which may include net gain realized on the exchange of Company capital stock for cash pursuant to the merger. A
U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust should consult his, her or its tax advisors regarding the applicability
of this Medicare tax to any gain realized on the exchange of Company capital stock for cash pursuant to the merger.
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Company capital stock that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is (1) a nonresident alien individual; (2) a foreign corporation; (3) an estate the income of
which is not subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (4) a trust that does not have in effect
a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes and either (a) no U.S. court is able
to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration or (b) no U.S. person has the authority to control all
substantial decisions of that trust.
Subject to the discussion of the potential application of Section 304 below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized upon the exchange of Company capital stock for cash pursuant to
the merger unless (i) the gain is “effectively connected” with the conduct of a trade or business of the Non-U.S.
Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the gain is attributable to a permanent
establishment or fixed base maintained in the United States) or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present
in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the merger, as applicable, and meets certain other
conditions. A Non-U.S. Holder described in clause (i) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net
income basis with respect to such gain in the same manner as if such holder were a resident of the United States and,
if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may, under certain circumstances, be
subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of 30 percent (or at a lower rate under an applicable income tax
treaty) on its “effectively connected” gains. Non-U.S. Holders described in clause (ii) generally will be subject
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to U.S. federal income tax at a 30 percent rate (or at a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain
derived from the sale, which gain may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses for the year.
Application of Section 304
Notwithstanding the discussion above, if one or more persons in the aggregate control both Company and Parent
before the merger, then Section 304 of the Code may apply to treat a holder that owns (actually or constructively)
Parent stock as deriving dividend income if one of the tests under Section 302 of the Code applies to such holder.
“Control” for this purpose generally means actual and constructive ownership of more than 50 percent of the
outstanding stock, by vote or by value, aggregating shares of stock held by all holders of both shares and shares of
stock of Parent, regardless of whether such holders are otherwise related.
Because Company and Parent do not have sufficient information to definitely determine that Section 304 of the Code
will not apply to the merger and, if it applies, the U.S. federal income tax consequences will depend on each holder’s
particular circumstances, holders of shares that are also holders of shares of stock of Parent are urged to consult their
tax advisors regarding the application of Section 304 and Section 302 of the Code to them. Additionally, withholding
agents may not be able to determine whether (or to what extent) a Non-U.S. Holder is treated as receiving a dividend
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, withholding agents may withhold tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower
rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the gross amount of any cash received in the merger
by a Non-U.S. Holder unless (i) the withholding agent has established special procedures allowing Non-U.S. Holders
to certify that they are exempt from such withholding tax and (ii) such Non-U.S. Holders are able to certify that they
meet the requirements of such exemption (e.g., because such Non-U.S. Holders are not treated as receiving dividends
under the tests under Section 302, described above). However, there can be no assurance that any withholding agent
will establish such special certification procedures. If a withholding agent withholds excess amounts from the cash
consideration payable to a Non-U.S. Holder, such Non-U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any such excess amounts
by timely filing an appropriate claim with the IRS.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for Company capital stock pursuant to the merger may be subject to information
reporting and backup withholding. To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. Holder that does not otherwise establish an
exemption from backup withholding should complete and return to the applicable withholding agent a properly
completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. Holder is a U.S. person, that the taxpayer
identification number provided is correct, and that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding. Non-U.S.
Holders generally will be exempt from backup withholding and information reporting requirements with respect to
payments made in exchange for Company capital stock pursuant to the merger if such Non-U.S. Holder furnishes to
the applicable withholding agent (i) a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E on which such Non-U.S. Holder
certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person or (ii) such other documentation upon which the
withholding agent may rely to treat the payments as made to a non-U.S. person in accordance with Treasury
Regulations.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, if such holder timely furnishes the
required information to the IRS.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Alternative Acquisition Structure
In the event that the Parent exercises the option to implement the Alternative Acquisition Structure, the tax treatment
for holders of Company capital stock who tender their shares of Company capital stock for cash payment equal to the
Merger Consideration in connection with the Alternative Acquisition Structure would be the same as receiving the
Merger Consideration upon consummation of the merger.

The merger is subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Consummation of the merger is also conditioned on approvals being
obtained or applicable waiting periods having expired or been terminated pursuant to the antitrust laws of certain
jurisdictions including Austria, China, Germany, Hungary, North Macedonia and South Korea, and the investment
screening laws of Germany and the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the merger cannot

be consummated if any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any order, executive order, temporary restraining order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (preliminary or

Lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Board or the Company’s officers in connection with the merger,
which could prevent or delay completion of the merger. On December 3, 2021, a lawsuit entitled Shiva Stein v. Rogers
Corporation et. al., Case No. 1:21-cv-10325 was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against the Company and the members of the Company’s Board (the “Stein Action”). On December 15,
2021, a lawsuit entitled Alex Ciccotelli v. Rogers Corporation et. al, Case No. 1:21-cv-10723, was filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and the members of the Company’s
Board (the “Ciccotelli Action”, and with the Stein Action, the “Actions”). The Actions allege that the defendants
violated Sections 14(a) (and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by, among other
things, including allegedly materially misleading or incomplete disclosure with respect to certain financial projections
of the Company and certain financial analyses of the Company’s financial advisor in the preliminary proxy statement
filed by the Company on December 1, 2021. The plaintiffs in the Actions seek, among other things, injunctive relief,
money damages and the costs of the Actions, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees.
The Company and the members of the Board disagree with and intend to vigorously defend against the Actions. If
the Actions are not resolved on a timely basis, the Actions could delay consummation of the merger and result in
additional costs to the Company, including costs associated with the indemnification of directors. Additional
lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Board or the Company’s officers in connection with the merger, which
could prevent or delay completion of the merger.

This proxy statement is being furnished to you as a shareholder of the Company as part of the solicitation of proxies
by the Company Board for use at the special meeting to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.
The Board, after due and careful discussion and consideration, unanimously determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and the Company’s shareholders, and declared it advisable, for the Company to enter into the
Merger Agreement, adopted the Merger Agreement and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the
Merger Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the merger, and resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders
of the Company.
The Board accordingly unanimously recommends that Company shareholders approve the Merger Agreement, as
disclosed in this proxy statement and particularly the related narrative disclosures in the sections of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger” beginning on page 24 and “Summary of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page
57 and as attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.
The merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement cannot be completed without the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of
the outstanding shares of Company capital stock entitled to vote thereon. A failure to vote, a broker non-vote or an
abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.
The vote on this proposal to approve the Merger Agreement is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote “FOR” either
or both of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement and vote
“AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” for this proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.
The approval of this proposal to approve the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of 66 2/3%
of the outstanding shares of Company capital stock as of the Record Date.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement.

(PROPOSAL TWO)","NONBINDING ADVISORY PROPOSAL REGARDING “GOLDEN PARACHUTE” COMPENSATION 
(PROPOSAL TWO)
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing shareholders with the opportunity to cast a
nonbinding advisory vote with respect to certain payments that may be made to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger, or “golden parachute” compensation, as reported on the Golden Parachute
Compensation table on page 48.
Accordingly we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers
in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the table in the section of the proxy statement entitled ‘The Merger-
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation’ including the associated narrative
discussion, is hereby approved.”
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company, the Board, the Board’s Compensation and
Organization Committee, Parent or any affiliate of Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are
contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome
of the advisory vote, if the Merger Agreement is approved by the shareholders and the merger is completed, the
“golden parachute” compensation will still be paid to our named executive officers to the extent payable in
accordance with the terms of such compensation.
The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a greater number of the votes cast in favor of this
proposal than votes cast against this proposal by the holders of the shares present or represented at the special
meeting and voting on such proposal.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding
“golden parachute” compensation.

We will ask our shareholders to vote only on this Proposal Three and not on the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement or the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation, if the Board
determines to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement.
In this proposal, we are asking our shareholders to approve a proposal to authorize the Board, in its discretion, to
adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at
the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement. If our shareholders approve the adjournment of the
special meeting, we could adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the
additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from shareholders that have
previously returned properly executed proxies voting against approval of the Merger Agreement.
The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement and the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation. Accordingly, you
may vote “FOR” either or both of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the nonbinding advisory
proposal regarding “golden parachute” compensation and vote “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” for the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement (and vice versa).
The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a greater number of the votes cast in favor of this

regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. They are not intended to provide factual information about the parties
or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Factual disclosures about the Company contained in this proxy
statement or in the Company’s public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual

made in the Merger Agreement by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub are qualified and subject to important
limitations agreed to by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger
Agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement
and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated
with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have
the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue
due to a change in circumstance or otherwise and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather
than establishing as facts the matters described therein. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties, which purport only to be accurate as of the date of such representations and
warranties, may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, and such subsequent developments or new

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, will merge with and into the Company in accordance with the MBCA and the Delaware General Corporation
Law (“DGCL”), with the Company continuing as the Surviving Corporation of the merger. As a result of the merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Surviving Corporation will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. The merger will have such other effects as provided in the MBCA and DGCL. The
Restated Articles of Organization of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation. The bylaws of the Company will also be amended and restated
in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be the
bylaws attached to the Merger Agreement as Exhibit A. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation.
The merger is subject to approval by the holders of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Company capital stock. The
Merger Agreement requires the Company to call the Company Shareholders Meeting, a special meeting of
shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote.

The closing of the merger will occur on the third business day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of each of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of such
conditions). The merger will become effective upon the filing of Articles of Merger with the Secretary of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the filing of a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the Company will agree in writing and will specify in the Articles of
Merger and the Certificate of Merger. We refer to such time as the merger becomes effective as the “Effective Time”.
We intend to complete the merger as promptly as practicable, subject to receipt of the Requisite Company Vote and
satisfaction of the other closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

At the Effective Time, each share of Company capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will automatically be converted into the right to receive $277.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to
deduction for any required tax withholding (the “Merger Consideration”). We refer to such shares (other than
Excluded Shares as defined below) as “Eligible Shares”.
At the Effective Time, any shares owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub will be canceled and will cease to
exist. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company capital stock owned by any direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent
or the Company will be converted into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of capital stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, such that each such direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or the
Company that owned Company capital stock in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will own the
same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, and no other consideration will be delivered or be deliverable in exchange for such subsidiary shares and any
such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation will remain outstanding. Shares of Company capital stock
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not
voted such shares in favor of the Merger Agreement, who are entitled to appraisal rights, and who have properly
exercised such rights in accordance with Part 13 of the MBCA, will not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. We refer to the shares described in this paragraph, collectively, as the “Excluded Shares”.
If prior to the Effective Time the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock will have been changed
into a different number of shares or securities or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, then the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company capital
stock the same economic effect as contemplated by the Merger Agreement prior to such event.

Prior to the closing date of the merger, Parent will select (with the Company’s prior approval) an exchange agent to
facilitate the payments of the amounts due as Merger Consideration (the “Exchange Agent”). As promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and on the closing date of the merger, Parent will deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Exchange Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds an aggregate amount of
cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration in respect of the Eligible Shares.
Within three business days after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record a certificate formerly representing any of the Eligible Shares (a “Certificate”), a notice advising such holder of
the effectiveness of the merger, a Letter of Transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery will be effected, and
risk of loss and title to a Certificate will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate, or affidavit of loss in lieu of a
Certificate, to the Exchange Agent and instructions for surrendering a Certificate to the Exchange Agent. As
promptly as practicable upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate together with a duly executed and
completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash
amount in immediately available funds, after giving effect to any required tax withholding, that such holder has the
right to receive. Any Certificate duly surrendered in accordance with such terms will be canceled by the Exchange
Agent.
Within three business days after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of book-entry shares not held through The Depositary Trust Company (“Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares”), a
notice advising such holder of the effectiveness of the merger, a Letter of Transmittal and instructions for transferring
the Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. As promptly as reasonably practicable upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares by book-receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions, Parent or Merger Sub
will cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver, a cash amount in immediately available funds, after giving effect to
any required tax withholding, that such holder has the right to receive.
With respect to book-entry shares held through DTC, the Company and Parent will cooperate to establish procedures
with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in
accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive.

In the event that any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration as if such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate had been surrendered.
You should not send your Certificates, if any, to the Exchange Agent until you have received transmittal materials
from the Exchange Agent. You should not surrender your Certificates, if any, without a Letter of Transmittal. Do
not return your Certificates, if any, with the enclosed proxy card.
Appraisal Rights
Shares of Company capital stock, other than Excluded Shares, that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted such shares in favor of the Merger Agreement,
and who are entitled to appraisal rights and have properly exercised such rights in accordance with Part 13 of the
MBCA, will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. We refer to such shares as the
“Dissenting Shares”. The holders of Dissenting Shares will be entitled to only such rights as are granted by, and will
be entitled only to receive such payments for such Dissenting Shares in accordance with, Part 13 of the MBCA. If
any such shareholder of the Company will fail to perfect or will effectively waive, withdraw or lose such shareholder’s
rights under Part 13 of the MBCA or if a court of competent jurisdiction will otherwise determine that such
shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Part 13 of the MBCA, such shareholder’s shares of Company
capital stock will cease to be Dissenting Shares and will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (payable without any interest thereon) upon surrender of Certificates or
book-entry shares and related documents. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares will be automatically canceled
and will cease to exist and any holder of Dissenting Shares will cease to have any rights except the rights provided in
Part 13 of the MBCA and as provided in the previous sentence.
The Company will give Parent prompt written notice of any notice received by the Company of an intent to demand
appraisal or the fair value of any shares of Company capital stock, withdrawals of such notices or demands and any
other instruments or notices served pursuant to the MBCA. The Company will also give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands and the exercise of
appraisal rights under the MBCA, if such negotiations and proceedings take place prior to the Effective Time. The
Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment or other commitment with
respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights, offer to settle or settle any such rights or waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with
the MBCA.

to the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations under the Merger Agreement are qualified by
reference to a “Material Adverse Effect”.
A “Material Adverse Effect” is defined to mean any effect, event, development, change, state of facts, condition,
circumstance or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate with all other effects has had or would be
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, properties, assets,
business operations or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that would or
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay, or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the merger. In the case of a Material Adverse Effect’s impact on the Company’s business, financial
condition, properties, assets, or operations, there are significant exceptions for certain categories of effects that will
not constitute a Material Adverse Effect. These include, among other items, effects resulting from general industry,
economic or legal developments, the Company’s failure to meet any internal or published projections, the
consequences of executing and announcing the Merger Agreement, pandemics or epidemics (including COVID-19) or
the general worsening thereof, and actions taken with Parent’s prior written consent. However, certain of these
effects may constitute a Material Adverse Effect insofar as they have a disproportionate Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or its subsidiaries relative to others in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate
or would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the
Company to consummate the merger.",70,70

The Company, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, and employees may not, and the Company
must use reasonable best efforts to cause its other representatives not to, take certain actions in connection with the
solicitation of an alternative Acquisition Proposal. An “Acquisition Proposal” means any proposal, offer or
indication of interest relating to a (i) merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization,
reorganization, spin-off, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries and involving, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
total assets of the Company or (ii) any acquisition of any class of equity securities of the Company or assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, in each case, by any person or group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange
Act) that if consummated would result in such person or group becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or
indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 20% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity
securities of the Company, or 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets of the
Company. This definition does not include the merger, or any other proposal, offer, or indication of interest made by
Parent or its affiliates and does not include any proposal or offer to the extent related to any purchase of assets
required to be divested in order to obtain governmental approval of the merger.
In particular, the Company is restricted from taking any of the following actions:
•
initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging (including by way of furnishing information relating to the
Company) or knowingly taking any action designed to facilitate an Acquisition Proposal;
•
engaging in, continuing or otherwise participating in any discussions with or negotiations relating to any
Acquisition Proposal;
•
providing any nonpublic information relating to, or affording access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of, the Company to any person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal;
•
otherwise knowingly facilitating any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal;
•
taking any action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover statute, or any restrictive provision of any
applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company’s organizational documents, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal; or
•
resolving, agreeing, authorizing, or committing to do any of the foregoing.
64TABLE OF CONTENTS
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company
receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise from a breach of the restrictions described above
and the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that,
based on the information then available, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal, as defined
below, or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may:
•
provide information in response to a request by the person making such Acquisition Proposal (as long as,
the Company has, to the extent legally permissible, made such information available to Parent and prior to
providing such information to such other person, the Company enters into an agreement with such person
that contains confidentiality provisions that are at least as restrictive in the aggregate as the confidentiality
agreement with Parent); and
•
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, and only with, the person making the Acquisition
Proposal.
A “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (except that the references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to “20% or more” will be deemed to be references to “50% or more”) made after the date of the
Merger Agreement that the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, (i) would result in a transaction more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company’s
shareholders than the merger and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed. Both (i) and (ii)
take into account all factors the Board deems relevant, including any legal, financial, regulatory, and shareholder
approval requirements, the existence of a financing contingency, the timing of closing and any revisions to the terms
of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to Parent’s rights to propose such revisions, as further
discussed above.
The Company must promptly, and in any event, within twenty-four hours give notice to Parent if the Company or any
of its Representatives receives any Acquisition Proposal and thereafter must keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status and material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, and discussions or negotiations concerning the material
terms thereof and as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within twenty-four hours following the receipt or
delivery thereof, provide Parent with unredacted copies of any written proposal, proposed transaction agreement or
other written material that describes the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.
Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company Shareholders
The Company may not enter into an agreement with another party in respect of an alternative Acquisition Proposal or
make a Change of Recommendation except in compliance with the specific requirements of the Merger Agreement, as
described below. A “Change of Recommendation” includes any of the following actions by the Board:
•
withholding, withdrawing, qualifying, amending or modifying (or publicly proposing or resolving to
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify) its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub;
•
following the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public or sent
or given to shareholders of the Company, failing to issue a press release publicly reaffirming its
recommendation within ten business days (or, if earlier, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting)
following Parent’s written request to do so;
•
failing to include its recommendation in this proxy statement or make or expressly authorize by resolution
the making of any public statement by any Company officer or director that is known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by the Board to have the same consequences as a withdrawal, qualification, amendment or
modification of the Company Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement);
•
failing to recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer by its shareholders under Rule 14d-2
of the Exchange Act for outstanding shares of Company capital stock, within ten business days after
receipt of a written request of Parent following the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
(or, if earlier, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting); or
•
approving or recommending, or publicly declaring advisable or publicly proposing to approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or publicly proposing to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company
receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise from a material breach of the “No Solicitation”
obligations described above, and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company may
effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive written
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal. Provided, however, that before taking any action set out in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company must give Parent written notice of such action (and the basis therefor)
four business days in advance, the Company must negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to revise the Merger Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior
Proposal and, at the end of four business days from the date of notice to Parent, the Board must determine, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, taking into account any changes to the terms of the
Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal. Simultaneously with such termination by Parent as a result of a Change of Recommendation or by the
Company in order to enter into a definitive written agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay the Company
Termination Fee, as defined below.
Furthermore, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation
if an Intervening Event, as defined below, has occurred and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response
to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law. However, prior to recommending such Acquisition Proposal, the Board must provide written notice of
such action and the basis therefor four business days in advance (such notice to include a reasonably detailed
description of the Intervening Event), the Company must negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent
wishes to negotiate) to revise the Merger Agreement, and the Board must determine in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, taking into account any changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, that such Intervening Event remains in effect and the failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable law.
“Intervening Event” means any effect occurring or arising after the date of the Merger Agreement that is material to
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board
as of or prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the material
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board), which effect, or any material
consequence thereof, becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the time the Requisite
Company Vote is obtained. However, this definition does not include (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any changes in
the market price or trading volume of the Company, (iii) the Company meeting, or failing to meet or exceeding
published or unpublished revenue or earnings projections in each case, in and of itself, (iv) any changes or
conditions generally affecting the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate in, except to the
extent such effect has a disproportionate effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to
others in such industries in respect of the business conducted in such industries or (v) general economic conditions
or securities, credit, financial or other capital markets conditions, in each case in the United States or any foreign
jurisdiction in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries operate, except to the extent such effect has a
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to others in the
industries in which the Company and any of its subsidiaries operate in respect of the business conducted in such
industries. In the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), the underlying causes of the foregoing may be taken into account in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred to the extent not otherwise excluded from this definition.

to the extent required by law (after consultation with outside legal counsel) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable law or (ii) if, as of the time for which the
Company Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company capital stock
represented either in attendance or by proxy and voting to approve the Merger Agreement or to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting.

The Company will, subject to the right of the Board to effect a Change of Recommendation in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement, include the Company Recommendation in this proxy statement and use reasonable
best efforts to solicit from the shareholders of the Company proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement and to secure the Requisite Company Vote. The Company will, at the instruction of Parent, postpone or
adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in attendance or by proxy at
such meeting to approve the Merger Agreement to allow reasonable time for the solicitation of proxies for purposes
of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote.
The Company will establish a record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting in reasonable consultation with
Parent and subject to compliance with the MBCA and Exchange Act. In no event will the record date be changed
without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except in the event that any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable law and the Company
Shareholders Meeting is postponed or the Company postpones the Company Shareholders Meeting at the
instruction of Parent, and in either case, as a result, the initial record date fixed by the Board is more than seventy
days before the date of the subsequent meeting.
The Company agrees to provide Parent reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on
a timely basis and to give written notice to Parent one business day prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting and
on the day of, but prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, indicating whether as of such date sufficient proxies
representing the Requisite Company Vote have been obtained. The only matters to be voted upon at the Company
Shareholders Meeting will be the Requisite Company Vote and routine proposals required in connection with such

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company and Parent are required
to cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their respective subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and to do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under the Merger Agreement and applicable law to cause the conditions to closing to
be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date, as
defined below) and to consummate and make effective the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings, and to obtain as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all consents necessary or

other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Both Company and Parent have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take all reasonably necessary, proper, or
advisable steps to avoid the entry of, or resist, modify, prevent, eliminate or remove any actual, threatened,
temporary, permanent, or preliminary governmental order (including any injunction or judgment) that would delay,
restrain, prevent, or otherwise prohibit the merger. Company and Parent have agreed, in furtherance of the foregoing
covenant, to defend through litigation any such order, to divesting, disposing, or holding separate certain business,
product lines, or assets, or to abide by other restrictions or actions following the closing that would limit the use of
such businesses, product lines, or assets. However, these obligations do not require Parent to take any action that
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition, or
results of either of (i) the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) Parent and its subsidiaries (other than
the Company), taken as a whole, and treating for such purpose the effect of such action as if it affected a company

financing becomes unavailable and Parent lacks cash on hand or other sources of available funds, Parent must notify
Company and use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing, which must be no less favorable
in any material respect than the Credit Agreement.
The Merger Agreement requires the Company to use its reasonable best efforts to provide reasonable and customary

business or ongoing operations of the Company. Parent has agreed to reimburse the Company and its subsidiaries

connection with such cooperation.
Obtaining such debt financing is not a condition to closing the merger.

Parent has agreed to waive any pre-existing condition limitations under employee benefit plans of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any condition in which any continuing employee would have been entitled to coverage
under an existing benefit plan in which such employee participated prior to the Effective Time. Parent has further
agreed to credit such continuing employees under such employee benefit plans for any eligible expenses incurred
during the portion of the year prior to the Effective Time for purposes of co-payment, co-insurance, deductibles, or
out-of-pocket maximums in respect of the plan year in which the closing occurs. For the purposes of eligibility,
vesting, continuous service, vacation, paid time off and severance entitlements, Parent will credit continuing
employees for their service to the Company as of the Effective Time other than where crediting would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.
Additionally, as soon as practicable after the closing (but no later than the first payroll period after the closing), the
Surviving Corporation will pay to each eligible continuing employee any unpaid annual cash bonus for the preceding
fiscal year, less any required withholding taxes. The Surviving Corporation also will pay, less any required
withholding taxes, the annual cash bonus earned for the fiscal year in which the closing occurs, at the time bonuses
are typically paid under the Surviving Corporation’s annual bonus plan, subject to the relevant employee’s continued
employment through such date, except that in the event of certain terminations of employment, the Surviving
Corporation will pay a prorated cash bonus (calculated using the number of days in the performance period that have
elapsed as of the termination, divided by 365) based on the greater of actual or target performance immediately before
the termination.

accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Parent has the right to complete the merger as a tender offer
only if such change in structure would not and, would not reasonably be expected to, in each case, in the good faith
judgment of Parent, jeopardize or impede the consummation of the merger or the receipt of any required approvals of
governmental entities. If Parent exercises such election, Parent and the Company have agreed to use reasonable best
efforts to amend the Merger Agreement to provide for such structure. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company have
agreed to certain customary terms for any such tender offer that must be included in such amended merger agreement
in the event that Parent exercises its right to elect the alternative acquisition structure.

In addition, Parent and Merger Sub will not be required to consummate the merger unless the following conditions
have been satisfied in full (or waived by them):
•
all representations of the Company must be true and correct as of the closing insofar as their failure to be

The Company will not be required to consummate the merger unless the following conditions have been satisfied in
full (or waived by it):
•
the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub must be true and correct as of both the date

Termination",77,78
ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,Termination,"Termination
The Merger Agreement may be terminated by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company at any prior time
prior to the Effective Time.
The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time will not have
occurred on the date that is six months from the date of the Merger Agreement (the “Outside Date”). However, if
certain conditions to closing relating to governmental antitrust or foreign direct investment approvals have not been
satisfied or waived as of the Outside Date, but all other conditions have been satisfied, then the Outside Date will be
extended for an additional three months after the initial Outside Date. Additionally, if such conditions to closing
related to such approvals have not been satisfied as of such extended Outside Date, then the Outside Date will be
further extended for an additional three months after the first extended Outside Date (for a final Outside Date that is a
year from signing). The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either Parent or the Company, if a governmental
entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted any law or order that permanently prohibits the consummation of the
merger, and such law or order has become final and non-appealable. The Merger Agreement may also be terminated
by either Parent or the Company if the Requisite Company Vote will not have been obtained at the Company
Shareholders Meeting or the final adjournment or postponement thereof.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated by Parent, prior to the obtainment of the Requisite Company Vote, if the
Board will have made a Change of Recommendation or if the Company or its representatives have materially breached
their no-solicitation or other obligations under Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement may
also be terminated by Parent, prior to the Effective Time, if the Company has breached any of its representations,
warranties, or covenants such that relevant conditions to closing are not satisfied and such breach is not curable
prior to the Outside Date (or if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured within the earlier of 30 days after
notice by Parent to the Company or three business days before the Outside Date). The Merger Agreement may also
be terminated by Parent, prior to the Effective Time, if a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction in the U.S. or
certain foreign jurisdictions will have entered an order in connection with a requisite governmental approval that has
become final and non-appealable, remains in effect, and requires Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the
Company and its subsidiaries) to take actions that would have a Burdensome Effect.

The Merger Agreement provides for, in certain circumstances, a Company Termination Fee payable by the Company
to Parent in an amount of $135 million. The Company would be obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee to
Parent in the following circumstances:
•
either party terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of the merger not having been consummated by
the Outside Date or as a result of the Requisite Company Vote not having been obtained at the Company
Shareholders Meeting and, in either case, (i) an Acquisition Proposal is publicly made directly to the
Company’s shareholders or is otherwise publicly known or any person has publicly announced an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, and such proposal or intention has not been publicly withdrawn
prior to the date of such termination (with respect to any termination in connection with the failure to
consummate the merger by the Outside Date) or the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting (with
respect to any termination in connection with the failure to obtain the Requisite Company Vote) and (ii)
within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into an alternative

•
Parent terminates the Merger Agreement because the Board has made a Change of Recommendation or the
Company or its representatives have materially breached their no-solicitation or other obligations in
Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement;
•
either party terminates the Merger Agreement because the Requisite Company Vote is not obtained and
Parent had the right to terminate the Merger Agreement because the Board made a Change of
Recommendation; or
•
the Company terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive written agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal.
The Merger Agreement provides for, in certain circumstances, a Regulatory Termination Fee payable by Parent to the
Company in an amount of $162.5 million. Parent would be obligated to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee to the
Company in the following circumstances:
•
either Parent or the Company terminates the Merger Agreement because a governmental entity of
competent jurisdiction in the U.S. or certain foreign jurisdictions has enacted a final, non-appealable law or
order related to applicable antitrust or foreign investment laws that permanently prohibits the
consummation of the merger;
•
either party terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of the merger not having been consummated by
the Outside Date and certain conditions to closing related to antitrust or foreign investment laws have not
been satisfied, but all of Parent’s other conditions have been satisfied or would be capable of being

APPRAISAL RIGHTS",82,84
ROGERS CORP_20211216_DEFM14A_19721647_4352864.Pdf,APPRAISAL RIGHTS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS
Under the provisions of Part 13 of the MBCA, a shareholder of a Massachusetts corporation is entitled to appraisal
rights, and payment of the fair value of his, her or its shares, in the event of certain corporate actions. Appraisal
rights offer shareholders the ability to demand payment in cash of the fair value of their shares in the event they are
dissatisfied with the consideration that they are to receive in connection with the corporate action. Under Section
13.02(a)(1) of the MBCA, shareholders of a Massachusetts corporation generally are entitled to appraisal rights in the
event of a merger, but such rights are subject to certain exceptions. Under the MBCA, the Company is required to
state whether it has concluded that Company shareholders are, are not or may be entitled to assert appraisal rights.
The Company has concluded that Company shareholders may be entitled to appraisal rights.
An exception set forth in Section 13.02(a)(1) of the MBCA generally provides that shareholders are not entitled to
appraisal rights in a merger in which shareholders already holding marketable securities receive cash and/or
marketable securities of the Surviving Corporation in the merger and no director, officer or controlling shareholder
has a direct or indirect material financial interest in the transaction, subject to certain exceptions. As of the date of
this proxy statement, this provision has not been the subject of judicial interpretation. We reserve the right to contest
the validity and availability of any purported demand for appraisal rights in connection with the merger and to assert
the applicability of the foregoing exception. We also reserve the right to raise such additional arguments, if any, we
may have in opposition to appraisal.
Any shareholder who believes that he, she or it is entitled to appraisal rights and who wishes to preserve those
rights should carefully review Part 13 of the MBCA, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C,
which sets forth the procedures to be complied with in perfecting any such rights. Failure to strictly comply with the
procedures specified in Part 13 of the MBCA would result in the loss of any appraisal rights to which shareholders
may be entitled. To the extent any shareholder seeks to assert appraisal rights but is determined by a court not to be
entitled to such appraisal rights (or was entitled to exercise such appraisal rights but failed to take all necessary
action to perfect them or effectively withdraws or loses them), such shareholder will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest.
Under the MBCA, shareholders who perfect their rights to appraisal in accordance with Part 13 of the MBCA and do
not thereafter withdraw their demands for appraisal or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in
accordance with the MBCA, will be entitled to demand payment of the “fair value” of their shares of Company capital
stock, together with interest, each as determined under Part 13 of the MBCA. The fair value of the shares is the value
of the shares immediately before the Effective Time of the merger, excluding any element of value arising from the
expectation or accomplishment of the merger, unless exclusion would be inequitable. Shareholders should be aware
that the fair value of their shares of Company capital stock as determined by Part 13 of the MBCA could be more
than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek
appraisal of their shares.
Shareholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights or to preserve their right to do so should review the following
discussion and Part 13 of the MBCA carefully. Shareholders who fail to timely and properly comply with the
procedures specified will lose their appraisal rights. If a broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares of Company
capital stock and you wish to assert appraisal rights, you must instruct your nominee to take the steps necessary to
enable you to assert appraisal rights. If you or your nominee fails to follow all of the steps required by the MBCA,
you will lose any right to demand appraisal of your shares. You should note that a vote in favor of the Merger
Agreement will result in the waiver of any right that you would otherwise have to demand payment for your shares
under the appraisal rights provisions of the MBCA.
A shareholder who wishes to assert appraisal rights must deliver written notice of such shareholder’s intent to
demand payment to the Company’s principal offices at the following address: Rogers Corporation, 2225 W. Chandler
Blvd., Chandler, AZ 85224, c/o Office of the Corporate Secretary of the Company. If the Company does not receive a
shareholder’s written notice of intent to demand payment prior to the vote at the special meeting of shareholders, or
if such shareholder votes, or causes or permits to be voted, his, her or its shares of Company capital stock in favor of
approval of the Merger Agreement, such shareholder will not be entitled to any appraisal rights under the provisions
of the MBCA and will instead only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. The submission of a proxy card
voting “against” or “abstaining” on the Merger Agreement proposal will not constitute sufficient notice of a
shareholder’s intent to demand appraisal rights to satisfy Part 13 of the MBCA.
76TABLE OF CONTENTS
Unless a shareholder of record consents in writing to the exercise of appraisal rights by a beneficial owner in
accordance with Part 13 of the MBCA, only a holder of record of shares of Company capital stock may exercise
appraisal rights. Except as described below, a shareholder may assert appraisal rights only if such shareholder seeks
such rights with respect to all of his, her or its shares. A record shareholder may assert appraisal rights as to fewer
than all the shares registered in his, her or its name but owned by a beneficial shareholder only if the record
shareholder objects with respect to all shares of the class or series owned by the beneficial shareholder and notifies
the Company in writing of the name and address of each beneficial shareholder on whose behalf appraisal rights are
being asserted. The rights of a record shareholder who asserts appraisal rights for only part of the shares held of
record in the record shareholder’s name will be determined as if the shares as to which the record shareholder objects
and the record shareholder’s other shares were registered in the names of different record shareholders.
If the merger is completed, Part 13 of the MBCA requires the Company to deliver a written appraisal notice to all
shareholders who satisfied the requirements described above. The appraisal notice must be sent by the Company no
earlier than the date the merger becomes effective and no later than 10 days after such date. The appraisal notice
must include a copy of Part 13 of the MBCA and a certification form that specifies the date of the first announcement
to Company shareholders of the principal terms of the merger and requires the shareholder asserting appraisal rights
to certify (1) whether or not beneficial ownership of the shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired
before the announcement date and (2) that the shareholder did not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement. The
appraisal notice also must state:
•
the date by which the Company must receive the certification form, which may not be fewer than 40 nor
more than 60 days after the date the appraisal notice and certification form are sent to shareholders
demanding appraisal, and that the shareholder waives the right to demand appraisal with respect to the
shares unless the Company receives the certification form by such date;
•
where the certification form must be sent and where certificates for certificated shares must be deposited
and the date by which the certificates must be deposited;
•
the Company’s estimate of the fair value of the shares;
•
that, if requested by the shareholder in writing, the Company will provide the number of shareholders who
return certification forms by the due date and the total number of shares owned by them; and
•
the date by which the notice to withdraw a demand for appraisal must be received.
Once a shareholder deposits his, her or its certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the executed
certification form, the shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder unless the shareholder withdraws from the
appraisal process by notifying the Company in writing by the withdrawal deadline. A shareholder who does not
withdraw from the appraisal process in this manner may not later withdraw without the Company’s written consent. A
shareholder who does not execute and return the form (and in the case of certificated shares, deposit such
shareholder’s share certificates) by the due date will not be entitled to payment under Part 13 of the MBCA.
Part 13 of the MBCA provides for certain differences in the rights of shareholders exercising appraisal rights
depending on whether their shares are acquired before or after the announcement of a merger. Except with respect to
shares acquired after the announcement date of November 2, 2021, the Company must pay in cash to those
shareholders who are entitled to appraisal rights and have complied with the procedural requirements of Part 13 of the
MBCA, the amount that the Company estimates to be the fair value of their shares, plus interest. Interest accrues
from the Effective Time of the merger until the date of payment, at the average rate currently paid by the Company on
its principal bank loans or, if none, at a rate that is fair and equitable under all the circumstances. This payment must
be made by the Company within 30 days after the due date of the certification form, and must be accompanied by:
•
recent financial statements of the Company;
•
a statement of the Company’s estimate of the fair value of the shares, which estimate must equal or exceed
the Company’s estimate given in the appraisal notice; and
•
a statement that shareholders who complied with the procedural requirements have the right, if dissatisfied
with such payment, to demand further payment as described below.
A shareholder who has been paid the Company’s estimated fair value and is dissatisfied with the amount of the
payment must notify the Company in writing of his, her or its estimate of the fair value of the shares and demand
77
TABLE OF CONTENTS
payment of that estimate plus interest, less the payment already made. A shareholder who fails to notify the Company
in writing of his, her or its demand to be paid such shareholder’s stated estimate of the fair value plus interest within
30 days after receiving the Company’s payment waives the right to demand further payment and will be entitled only
to the payment made by the Company based on the Company’s estimate of the fair value of the shares.
The Company may withhold payment from shareholders who are entitled to appraisal rights but did not certify that
beneficial ownership of all of such shareholder’s shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before
the announcement date. If the Company elects to withhold payment, it must provide such shareholders notice of
certain information within 30 days after the due date of the certification form, including the Company’s estimate of fair
value and the shareholder’s right to accept the Company’s estimate of fair value, plus interest, in full satisfaction of
the shareholder’s demand. Those shareholders who wish to accept the offer must notify the Company of their
acceptance within 30 days after receiving the offer. Within 10 days after receiving a shareholder’s acceptance, the
Company must pay in cash the amount it offered in full satisfaction of the accepting shareholder’s demand.
A shareholder offered payment who is dissatisfied with that offer must reject the offer and demand payment of his,
her or its stated estimate of the fair value of such shareholder’s shares, plus interest. A shareholder who fails to
notify the Company in writing of his, her or its demand to be paid his, her or its stated estimate of the fair value plus
interest within 30 days after receiving the Company’s offer of payment waives the right to demand payment and will
be entitled only to the payment offered by the Company based on the Company’s estimate of the fair value of the
shares. Those shareholders who do not reject the Company’s offer in a timely manner will be deemed to have
accepted the Company’s offer, and the Company must pay to them in cash the amount it offered to pay within 40
days after sending the offer.
If a shareholder makes a demand for payment which remains unsettled, the Company must commence an equitable
proceeding in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, within 60 days after receiving the payment
demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If the Company does not
commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it must pay in cash to each shareholder the amount such
shareholder demanded, plus interest. The Company must make all shareholders whose demands remain unsettled
parties to the proceeding as an action against their shares, and all parties must be served with a copy of the petition.
Each shareholder made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment (1) for the amount, if any, by which the court
finds the fair value of the shareholder’s shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the Company to the
shareholder for such shares or (2) the fair value, plus interest, of the shareholder’s shares for which the Company
elected to withhold payment.
The court in an appraisal proceeding must determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable
compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court must assess any costs against the
Company, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in
amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not
in good faith with respect to the rights provided by Part 13 of the MBCA.
The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective
parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:
•
against the Company and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the
Company did not substantially comply with its requirements under Part 13 of the MBCA; or
•
against either the Company or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court
finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not
in good faith with respect to the rights provided by Part 13 of the MBCA.
If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the services of counsel for any shareholder were of substantial
benefit to other shareholders similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against
the Company, the court may award to such counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the
shareholders who were benefited. To the extent the Company fails to make a required payment pursuant to Part 13 of
the MBCA, the shareholder may sue directly for the amount owed and, to the extent successful, will be entitled to
recover from the Company all costs and expenses of the suit, including counsel fees.
The foregoing discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the MBCA and
is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Part 13 of the MBCA, which is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex C. Shareholders should consult with their advisors, including legal counsel, in connection with any demand
for appraisal.

In the event that the Merger Agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, our shareholders will not receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for their shares of
Company capital stock. Instead, we would remain an independent public company, our capital stock would continue
to be listed and traded on the NYSE and our shareholders would continue to be subject to the same risks and
opportunities to which they currently are subject with respect to their ownership of Company capital stock. If the
merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future
value of our shares, including the risk that the market price of Company capital stock may decline to the extent that
the current market price of our stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. If the merger is
not completed, our business could be disrupted, including our ability to retain and hire key personnel, potential
adverse reactions or changes to our business relationships and uncertainty surrounding our future plans and
prospects.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, we are permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement
and to accept a superior proposal. See “Summary of the Merger Agreement-Termination” beginning on page 70.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, if the merger is not completed, we may be obligated
to pay Parent a termination fee or Parent may be obligated to pay us a termination fee. See “Summary of the Merger
Agreement-Termination Fees” beginning on page 71.",87,87

OPINION OF J.P. MORGAN
 
November 1, 2021
The Board of Directors
Rogers Corporation
2225 West Chandler Boulevard
Chandler, Arizona 85224
Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of capital
stock, par value $1.00 per share (the “Company Capital Stock”), of Rogers Corporation (the “Company”) of the
consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Dupont de Nemours, Inc. (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of November 1, 2021 (the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror and its wholly-owned subsidiary
(the “Acquisition Sub”), the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding
share of Company Capital Stock, other than shares of Company Capital Stock held in treasury or owned by the
Acquiror and its affiliates and Excluded Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to
receive $277.00 per share in cash, without interest thereon (the “Merger Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated November 1, 2021 of the Agreement; (ii)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in
which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial
terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Capital Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management of the Company
relating to its business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other
information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We
have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
have we evaluated the solvency of the Company, Acquiror or the Acquisition Sub under any state or federal laws
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or
derived therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments by the Company’s management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as
to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the
Agreement, and that the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished
to us. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, Acquiror and the
Acquisition Sub in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material
to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to
the Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or
other
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse
effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion
and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in
connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express
no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any
party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders
of shares of Company Capital Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee
from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed
Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or
investment banking relationships with the Company and Acquiror, for which we and such affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period for the Company have included acting as joint lead
arranger and joint bookrunner on the Company’s credit facility in October 2020. Such services during such period for
the Acquiror have included acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on credit facilities of the Acquiror in
April 2020 and April 2021, acting as joint lead bookrunner on the Acquiror’s offering of debt securities in April 2020
and acting as the Acquiror’s financial advisor in connection with the separation and merger of the Acquiror’s
Nutrition and Biosciences business in February 2021 and the Acquiror’s acquisition of Laird Performance Materials
in July 2021. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit
facilities of the Company and the Acquiror for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits.
In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock and
common stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror, respectively. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we
and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,
bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or the Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial
instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to
be paid to the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders.
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This
letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the
purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This
opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose
whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information
statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without
our prior written approval.
Very truly yours,

the executed commitment letter, together with all attachments thereto, from the Financing Entities party thereto,
dated as of the date hereof (the “Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which the Financing Entities party thereto
have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide debt financing (the
“Financing”) to the Parent in the amounts described therein for the purposes of funding the transactions
contemplated hereby and the related fees and expenses and (y) any fee letters, redacted to remove fee amounts
and customary “flex” terms, none of which redacted provisions could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the conditionality, enforceability or availability, or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing
(collectively, the “Fee Letter” and together with the Commitment Letter, collectively, the “Commitment
Papers”). As of the date hereof, the Commitment Papers are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn

obligation of the Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance
with their terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, there is no agreement,
side letter or arrangement relating to the Financing that could (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
to be provided on the Closing Date to an amount that is less than the amount necessary, when combined with
Parent’s other sources of available funds, to pay the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date or (y) increase
the conditionality of the availability of such Financing, other than those set forth in the Commitment Papers.

party thereunder to make the Financing available to the Parent on the terms therein. As of the date hereof,

Knowledge of Parent, of any other party to thereto, under any term or condition of the Commitment Papers, (ii)
result in any of the conditions in the Commitment Letter not being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing not being available on the Closing Date. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b) and 7.2(d), as of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition to Closing to be satisfied by it with respect to the
Commitment Letter or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available as of the Closing. As of the date
hereof, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Papers on or
before the date hereof.
(c) Parent will have as of the Closing Date sufficient available funds to satisfy all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s
payment obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any

Requisite Company Vote is obtained, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received after the
date of this Agreement (that did not arise from or in connection with a breach of the obligations set forth in
Section 6.2), the Company may:
(i) provide information in response to a request therefor (including nonpublic information regarding it or
any of its Subsidiaries) to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives and
financing sources, provided that (A) such information has previously been made available to, or is made
available to, Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such information is made available
to such Person (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after the provision of such information),
except to the extent making such information available to Parent would violate applicable Law and (B) prior
to furnishing any such information, the Company receives from the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms that are at least as restrictive in the
aggregate on the other party as the terms in the Confidentiality Agreement are on Parent (provided that
such confidentiality agreement need not include any “standstill” terms if and to the extent that Parent is,
concurrently with entry by the Company or its Subsidiaries into such confidentiality agreement, released
from any standstill (or similar obligation) in the Confidentiality Agreement), and which confidentiality
agreement does not prohibit compliance with this Agreement; and
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with, and only with, such Person and its
Representatives and financing sources regarding such bona fide written Acquisition Proposal;
in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that, based on the
information then available, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal.
(c) Representatives. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that its Representatives are
aware of the provisions of this Section 6.2.
(d) Notice of Acquisition Proposals. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) give notice to Parent if, after the date of this Agreement, any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information or inquiry that contemplates or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal is received by it or any of its Representatives, setting forth in such notice the name of such Person and
the material terms and conditions thereof and thereafter shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
and material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including any amendments thereto), and
discussions or negotiations concerning the material terms thereof and (ii) as promptly as practicable (and in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours following the receipt or delivery thereof), provide Parent with unredacted
copies of any written proposal, proposed transaction agreement or other written material that describes the
terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.
(e) No Change of Recommendation.
(i) Except as permitted by Section 6.2(e)(ii), Section 6.2(e)(iii) or Section 6.2(f), the Company Board,
including any committee thereof, agrees it shall not:

withdraw, qualify, amend or modify) the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub;
(B) following the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made
public or sent or given to shareholders of the Company, fail to issue a press release publicly
reaffirming the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days (or, if earlier, prior to the

Recommendation;
(D) fail to recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer by its shareholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (other than
by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent), in each case, within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a
written request of Parent following the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (or, if
earlier, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting) (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no
position or a neutral position by the Company Board in respect of the acceptance of any such tender
offer or exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of any such offer);
(E) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose to approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement,
option agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
6.2(b) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(b)) (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”)
relating to any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C),
(D) and this clause (E), a “Change of Recommendation”),
(F) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement constituting or
related to, or which is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received after the date of
this Agreement that did not arise from or in connection with a material breach of the obligations set forth in
Section 6.2(a) is received by the Company and is not withdrawn, and the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may (x) effect a Change of Recommendation
or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(b), in order to enter into a definitive written
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, prior to taking such action
described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Company has given Parent written notice of such action and the
basis therefor four (4) Business Days in advance, which notice shall set forth in writing that the Company
Board intends to consider whether to take such action (such notice, the “Board Recommendation Notice”)
and include a copy of the most current version of the proposed agreement under which transaction
contemplated by such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated. After giving such Board
Recommendation Notice and prior to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Company
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate), to make such revisions
to the terms of this Agreement as would cause such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior
Proposal. At the end of the four (4) Business Day period, prior to and as a condition to taking any action
described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and any other proposals offered in writing by Parent in
response to the Board Recommendation Notice, and shall have determined in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that in the case of such Acquisition Proposal, such
Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal, if such changes offered in writing
by Parent were to be given effect. Any amendment to the financial terms and any other material amendment
to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Section
6.2(d) and this Section 6.2(e)(ii) and require a new Board Recommendation Notice, except that references in
this Section 6.2(e)(ii) to “four (4) Business Days” shall be deemed to be references to “two (2) Business
Days” and such two (2) Business Day period shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on the second (2nd) Business Day
immediately following the day on which such new Board Recommendation Notice is delivered (it being
understood and agreed that in no event shall any such additional two (2) Business Day period be deemed
to shorten the initial four (4) Business Day period).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation (A) if
an Intervening Event has occurred and (B) prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that failure to take
such action in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that prior to making such Change
of Recommendation, the Company has given Parent a Board Recommendation Notice four (4) Business
Days in advance, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event.
After giving such Board Recommendation Notice and prior to effecting a Change of Recommendation, the
Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate), to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement. At the end of the four (4) Business Day period, prior to and as a
condition to effecting a Change of Recommendation, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and any other proposals offered in
writing by Parent in response to the Board Recommendation Notice, and shall have determined in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that (I) such Intervening
Event remains in effect and (II) the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(f) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable United States federal or state Law including with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making any “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (iii)
contacting any Person or group or their respective Representatives who has made a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in breach of this Section 6.2 solely for the purpose of clarifying the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal; provided that, the foregoing notwithstanding, the Company
may not effect a Change of Recommendation except in accordance with Section 6.2(e)(ii) or Section 6.2(e)(iii).
(g) Existing Discussions. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly
deliver a written notice to each such Person providing only that the Company is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal or transaction that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall also request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information concerning the Company and any of its Subsidiaries heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company will promptly
terminate all physical and electronic data access previously granted to such Persons.
(h) Standstill Provisions. During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the
Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality,
“standstill” or similar agreement to which the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party and
shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the

Days after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the
preliminary proxy statement relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the “Proxy Statement”). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to
comments from the SEC and, after the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the
Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement, to promptly thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to the
shareholders of the Company. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments from the
SEC and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall

approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that no such approval of Parent
shall be required with respect to any amendment or supplement of the Proxy Statement in connection with a
Change of Recommendation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will promptly furnish to the Company the
information relating to it as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder

Company and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company will cause the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, either Party obtains
Knowledge of any information pertaining to it or previously provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
that would require any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that any of such documents would
not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such Party
shall promptly advise the other Party and the Parties shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by applicable Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company shareholders.
(c) The Company will provide legal counsel to Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
drafts of the Proxy Statement, responses to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, and other
documents related to the Company Shareholders Meeting, prior to filing such documents with the applicable
Governmental Entity and mailing such documents to the shareholders of the Company. The Company shall
consider in good faith and incorporate, in the Company’s discretion following such good faith consideration,
the reasonable comments thereon of Parent and its legal counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions

sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to approve this Agreement to allow
reasonable time for the solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote. The
Company will establish a record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting in reasonable consultation with
Parent and subject to compliance with the MBCA and Exchange Act. In no event will the record date be

Company Shareholders Meeting at the instruction of Parent, and in either case, as a result, the initial record date
fixed by the Company Board is more than 70 days before the date of the subsequent meeting.

solicitation results on a timely basis and (ii) to give written notice to Parent one (1) Business Day prior to the

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is agreed that Parent may modify, supplement or amend the

Days) notify the Company of such unavailability and the reasons therefor, (ii) as promptly as practicable use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing (the “Alternative Financing”) (which

in any material respect than those set forth in the Commitment Papers and in an aggregate amount such that
Parent will have on the Closing Date sufficient funds to consummate the Transactions on the Closing Date) to
replace any unavailable portion of the Financing, to be consummated no later than the day on which the Closing
shall occur pursuant to Section 1.2; provided that such Alternative Financing shall not have conditions to

marketing efforts for the Debt Financing; provided, however, that the recipients of such information and any
other information contemplated to be provided by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section
6.6(e) agree to customary confidentiality arrangements, including “click through” confidentiality agreements and

Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations under the agreements for
the Debt Financing and (z) the Debt Financing shall not contain any restrictive covenant or other obligation that
is required to be performed or complied with by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. The
Company’s obligations under Section 6.6(e) are the sole obligations of the Company with respect to cooperation
in connection with the Debt Financing and no other provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to expand or
modify such obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and agreed that the
condition precedent set forth in Section 7.2(b) as applied to the Company’s obligations under

(h) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Representatives
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with any action taken by them in connection with Section
6.6(e) except to the extent such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments
and penalties are determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives.
(i) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain a customary payoff letter effective as of the Closing, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, from the lenders under the Company Credit Agreement (or the agent of such lenders),

thereon and all fees and other amounts accrued under the Company Credit Agreement and related loan
documents (the “Payoff Amount”), (b) contain payment instructions, (c) state that upon receipt of the Payoff
Amount, the outstanding Indebtedness, liabilities, liens and guarantees under the Company Credit Agreement

the Company or Parent to file UCC termination statements and any other applicable lien release documents upon

attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to any Proceeding, in connection with, arising out of or
otherwise related to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including in connection with (i) this Agreement or the Transactions and (ii)
actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party,
and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent that such individual
would have been entitled to under applicable Law, the Company’s Organizational Documents and any
indemnification agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement; provided that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final
adjudication in a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification with respect
to such expenses.
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for “tail” insurance policies
for the extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and
officers’ insurance policies for a claims reporting period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (the
“Tail Period”) from one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s
insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
(collectively, “D&O Insurance”) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable to the insureds as the Company’s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions); provided that in
no event shall the aggregate cost of the “tail” for the D&O Insurance exceed during the Tail Period 300% of the
current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for such purpose; and provided, further, that if the cost
of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
(c) During the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Transactions unchanged
and shall not be amended, restated, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect
any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party.
The Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and, as applicable, the Surviving Corporation’s
Subsidiaries shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, contain provisions related to indemnification
no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the indemnification and exculpation from liability provisions in
the Organizational Documents of the Company and its relevant Subsidiaries on the date hereof.
(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person or (iii) shall convert into another Person
or domesticate into another jurisdiction, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.12.
(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.12 shall survive consummation of the Merger and
are in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any indemnification agreements or other applicable Contracts of
the Company or Laws.
(f) This Section 6.12 is intended to be for the benefit of, and from and after the Effective Time shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, who shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.12.
