Period shall not commence unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect to such financial statements for the applicable periods
by such auditor or another independent public accounting firm of recognized national standing, (B) the Company shall have announced, or the board of
directors of the Company shall have determined, that a restatement of any historical financial information constituting Company Required Financial
Information is required, in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed not to commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and
the applicable Company Required Financial Information has been amended to reflect such restatement or Parent or the board of directors of Company
subsequently concludes that no restatement shall be required in accordance with GAAP, (C) the Company Required Financial Information, when taken as
a whole, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained in the
Company Required Financial Information not materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements are made, in which case the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence unless and until such Company Required Financial Information has been updated or supplemented
so that there is no longer, when taken as a whole, any such untrue statement of material fact or omission to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements contained therein not materially misleading, when taken as a whole, in light of the circumstances under which such circumstances
are made (provided that any supplemental disclosure that would typically be included in a customary pricing supplement (and that would not typically
require circulating updated disclosure to potential investors prior to pricing of any related securities offering) shall not be construed to be a material
misstatement or omission), or (D) the financial statements in the Company Required Financial Information are not sufficient to permit the Company’s
independent public accountants to issue a customary “comfort” letter to the Financing Sources, including as to customary negative assurance and
change period comfort, in order to consummate any offering of debt securities on any day during the Marketing Period (or the Company’s accountants
are not prepared to issue a customary comfort letter subject to their completion of customary procedures). If at any time the Company shall reasonably
believe that it has provided the Company Required Financial Information and that the Marketing Period has commenced, the Company may deliver to
Parent a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery and when it believes such period has commenced), in which
case, subject to clauses (A) through (C) above in the immediately preceding sentence, the Marketing Period will be deemed to have commenced on the
date of such notice, unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Marketing Period has not commenced and, within two Business Days after the
delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with reasonable specificity why Parent believes
the Marketing Period has not commenced and what Company Required Financial Information is required to be delivered to commence the Marketing
Period), following which the Company Required Financial Information shall be deemed to have been received by Parent as soon as the Company delivers
to Parent such specified portion of the Company Required Financial Information; provided that it is understood that the delivery of such written notice
from Parent to the Company will not prejudice the Company’s right to assert that the Company Required Financial Information has in fact been delivered
and that the Marketing Period has commenced.

the Payment Agent to send, to each record holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of (i) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares)

and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Until so surrendered

ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if (i) such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed and shall otherwise be in proper form for surrender and transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
pay to the Payment Agent any transfer Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or

Payment Agent, including, if necessary, the making of an affidavit by such Person and/or posting by such Person of a bond, in such customary amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this Article 2.
(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.04.
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company

with Section 2.03(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares that formerly represented such shares in the
manner provided in Section 2.04. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of

with all exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto) and (subject to customary redactions of fee amounts, pricing and “flex” provisions, so long as such

other conditions to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Financing (including the full amount of the Preferred Equity
Financing) available to Parent on the terms therein. There are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings to which TIBCO,

Effect on Financing. As of the date hereof, none of TIBCO, Parent or Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
will not be satisfied by Closing or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to Section
2.01. The obligations of TIBCO, Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding TIBCO’s, Parent’s, Merger
Sub’s, the Preferred Equity Issuer’s, their respective Affiliates’ or any other Person’s (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company’s or any
Subsidiary of the Company’s) ability to obtain the Financing or any other financing.
(b) Each of Parent and TIBCO has all requisite power and authority to perform its respective obligations under, and consummate the transactions
contemplated by, the Financing Commitment Letters applicable thereto. The performance by each of Parent and TIBCO of its respective obligations under,
and consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Financing Commitment Letters do not and will not (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) (a) conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing documents)
of such entity, (b) result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, or (c) require any consent or approval under, violate, result in
any breach of or default under, result in the acceleration of any obligation under, or result in termination or give to others any right of termination of, any
Contract (other than the TIBCO Credit Agreements) to which such entity is a party, or by which any of such entity’s properties or assets are bound, with
such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b) and (c) above, as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.
Section 5.09 Solvency. Each of TIBCO Parents, TIBCO, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Preferred Equity Issuer and their
respective Subsidiaries will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any debt financing (including the Debt Financing and Preferred Equity Financing) occurring in connection therewith. No transfer of
property is being made by TIBCO Parents, TIBCO, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Preferred Equity Issuer or any their respective
Subsidiaries (or is contemplated being made) and no obligation is being incurred (or is contemplated being incurred) by TIBCO Parents, TIBCO, Parent,

Corporation, the Preferred Equity Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or
any series of related transactions or any other transactions in close proximity with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (a) with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of TIBCO Parents, TIBCO, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Preferred Equity
Issuer, any Affiliate of Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (b) that could reasonably be expected to render TIBCO Parents, TIBCO, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Preferred Equity Issuer, any Affiliate of Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries not Solvent (or in
the zone of insolvency) or (c) that as of the date hereof, is reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the long term financial sustainability
of TIBCO Parents, TIBCO, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Preferred Equity Issuer and their respective Subsidiaries. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term “Solvent” when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (x) the amount of the “fair saleable
value” of the assets and property of such Person, in each case, will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all “liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities,” as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with Applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (y) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (z) such Person
will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent, subordinated and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, “not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent (it being understood that the amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in light of
all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability),
subordinated and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.
Section 5.10 Guarantees. Parent has furnished the Company with a duly executed, true, complete and correct copy of each Guarantee. Each
Guarantee is in full force and effect. Each Guarantee is (i) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the respective Guarantor and (ii) enforceable in
accordance with its respective terms against such Guarantor. There is no breach or default under any Guarantee by any Guarantor, and no event has
occurred that would constitute a breach or default (or with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default) thereunder by any
Guarantor.
Section 5.11 Absence of Certain Agreements. As of the date hereof, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings (in each case,
whether oral or written) between Parent, Merger Sub, any Equity Investor, any Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
member of the Company’s management or directors, on the other hand, that relate in any way to, or are in connection with, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including (A) any retention, severance or other compensation, incentives or benefits that may be or become payable in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or after the Effective Time, (B) any equity rollover or other similar transaction, or any equity or other
investment in Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any parent company thereof, or any Affiliate of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any parent
company thereof, following the Effective Time or (C) any directorship, employment, consulting arrangement or other similar association with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any parent company thereof, or Affiliate of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any parent company thereof, from and after the
Effective Time.
Section 5.12 Stock Ownership. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Investors nor any of their respective “affiliates” or “associates” is, or at any
time during the last three years has been, an “interested stockholder” of the Company, in each case as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

Company Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to Applicable Law and (2) permit Parent and its
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any proposed amendments with respect
thereto; and
(C) unless, prior to the expiration of such four Business Day period, the Company Board or a committee thereof determines in
good faith, taking into consideration any amendments to this Agreement, the Guarantees and the Financing Commitment Letters
proposed in writing by Parent (after consultation with a Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.
(c) Nothing contained in Section 6.02 or this Section 6.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure
that constitutes a “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or (iii) making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders that is required by Applicable Law or stock exchange rule or listing
agreement, which foregoing actions shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood that any
such statement or disclosure made by the Company Board or any committee thereof pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) must be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and this Section 6.03(c) in no way limits or otherwise affects the obligations of the Company or the Company Board and the
rights of Parent under this Agreement and that the foregoing will not be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 6.03(b)).
Section 6.04 Approval of Merger Agreement.
(a) The Company shall, in accordance with Applicable Law and the Company’s governing documents, and in consultation with Parent, take all
necessary action to duly set a record date for (and the Company will not change the record date without the prior written consent of Parent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders (including any
adjournments and postponements thereof, the “Stockholder Meeting”) for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the matters requiring
Stockholder Approval (with the Stockholder Meeting in no event being initially scheduled for a date later than the 25th Business Day following the first
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders) as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the date hereof to enable such record
date to be so set. Without the prior written consent of Parent, and except as may be required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s
stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement, obtaining the Stockholder Approval and a proposal with respect to adjournment of the
Stockholder Meeting shall be the only matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company’s stockholders at the Stockholder
Meeting. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholder Meeting (i) with the consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a quorum (it being understood that the Company may not
postpone or adjourn the Stockholder Meeting more than two times pursuant to this clause (ii) without Parent’s prior consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed)), (iii) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by Applicable Law is provided to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock with a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Stockholder Meeting, (iv) to allow additional time
for the solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Stockholder Approval (provided that the Stockholder Meeting shall not be delayed by more than 10
Business Days pursuant to this clause (iv) without the prior consent of Parent) and (v) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Stockholder
Meeting by Applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company shall postpone or adjourn the

Stockholder Meeting to allow additional time for the solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Stockholder Approval (provided that the Stockholder
Meeting shall not be delayed by more than 10 Business Days pursuant to this sentence unless mutually agreed by Parent and the Company). Unless the
Company Board or any committee thereof has withdrawn the Company Recommendation in compliance with Section 6.03, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and take all action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock required by Applicable Law to effect the Merger. Unless this Agreement
is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company will submit this Agreement for a vote by its stockholders at the Stockholder Meeting
even if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change.
(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than thirty days following the date hereof) after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall prepare a proxy statement in preliminary form for the Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto and any other required proxy materials, the “Proxy Statement”) and file it with the SEC. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other
in connection with the preparation of the foregoing, including to cause their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to cooperate with the preparation of the
foregoing. Subject to Section 6.03, the Company must include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify the other parties hereto promptly upon the receipt of any comments or other communications from the SEC or
its staff or any other Governmental Authorities and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Authorities for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply the others with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other Governmental Authorities, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate, and shall cause their Affiliates and advisors to cooperate, with the Company
in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all
information relating to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response and shall consider Parent’s comments in good faith.
(c) The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of
the Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Parent
shall ensure that such information supplied by it and its Affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.
(d) If at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting or any such filing, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any other required Company filing or any other required Parent filing, as the case may be, so that such
filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under

which they were made, not misleading, then the party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and the parties shall cooperate and
the Company shall promptly prepare an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information and shall file such amendment
or supplement with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the
Company’s stockholders.
(e) Subject to Applicable Law and to the terms of this Agreement, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the
SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement, which confirmation will be deemed to occur (absent any change in
protocol announced by the SEC) if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company on or prior to the tenth calendar day after filing the Proxy
Statement that the SEC will be reviewing the Proxy Statement.
Section 6.05 Access to Information. Subject to Applicable Law, Section 6.12, Section 6.18 and applicable contractual restrictions, upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable logistical restrictions or limitations as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures, the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent’s officers and Parent’s other Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, personnel, books, Contracts and records. The foregoing shall not require the Company
(a) to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to the extent that the provision of such information would in the
good faith judgment of the Company based on advice of outside counsel jeopardize any trade secret protection or any attorney-client, work product or
other legal privilege or protection (it being agreed that, in the case of clause (a), that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information or documents and thereafter the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or waive the applicable privilege or protection), (b) to provide
access to or otherwise make available or furnish any information relating to the process conducted by the Company that led to the execution of this
Agreement (except as may be required by Section 6.02) or (c) to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to the
extent that such access or availability would jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries in light of COVID-19
(taking into account any COVID-19 Measures). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives not to, initiate contact with any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not involved in
the negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any customer, Distribution Partner, technology or other partner, vendor or supplier
of the Company in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, without the Company’s
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that no breach of this sentence shall
be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the closing condition set forth in Section 7.03(b) has been satisfied. Any access to the
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not
include the right to perform invasive testing or site assessments.
Section 6.06 Notice of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the
other informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or
existence of any change, event, effect, occurrence or development that (a) with respect to the Company, has had or would reasonably be expected have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (b) with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, and/or (c) is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article 7 not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date. No
notification given by any party pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations
or conditions contained in this Agreement.

Section 6.07 Employee Matters.
(a) As of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. For a period of not less than twelve months following the Closing (or, if sooner, until the date of termination of
employment of the relevant Continuing Employee), Parent shall provide each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is employed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Closing Date and who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Closing Date (each a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) base salary or base
hourly rate in an amount at least equal to the level that was provided to each such Continuing Employee prior to the Closing Date and (ii) target incentive
compensation (including commissions) in an amount at least equal to the aggregate target cash incentive opportunities that were provided to each such
Continuing Employee prior to the Closing Date. Until December 31, 2022 (or, if sooner, until the date of termination of employment of the relevant
Continuing Employee), Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with employee benefits (other than equity awards, defined benefit pension, post-
employment welfare and non-qualified deferred compensation or benefits) that are at least as favorable in the aggregate to those provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Company Employee Plans set forth on Schedule 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. In addition, for a period of twelve months following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its respective Subsidiaries to
assume and honor, the terms of the Company’s severance guidelines set forth in Section 6.07(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and provide the
severance payments and benefits required thereunder to any eligible Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated under the circumstances
described therein prior to the 12-month anniversary of the Closing.
(b) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause each Continuing Employee’s service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any
predecessors thereto or any other entities that have been merged with or into or been acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to the
Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, future vacation accruals, determining levels of benefits (but for the avoidance of
doubt not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) and vesting under each compensation, severance, retirement, vacation, paid time
off, fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (excluding any equity
compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate immediately
following the Closing) (collectively, the “Parent Benefit Plans”), but solely to the extent service was credited to such employee for such purposes under
a comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits or compensation. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall assume all obligations for any and all vacation
and paid time off balances of Continuing Employees and assume and pay all costs and notice obligations incurred in connection with terminations of
non-Continuing Employees.
(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is an “employee welfare benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required
physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee was a participant immediately prior to the Closing Date but, with respect to long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage, solely
to the extent permitted under the terms and conditions of Parent’s applicable insurance contracts in effect as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility conditions based on periods of employment, Section 6.07(b) shall control;
and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying

any applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such expenses
were recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company Employee Plan.
(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its
terms, (i) each existing employment, change in control, retention, bonus, cash incentive, severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement
of or between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director or employee of the Company or Subsidiary, and (ii) all
vested and accrued benefits under any Company Employee Plan. Parent acknowledges that the transaction contemplated hereby shall constitute a
“change in control”, “change of control”, “acquisition” and/or “sale event” (or a term of similar import) for purposes of each Company Employee Plan set
forth on Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that uses such term (or a term of similar import).
(e) This Section 6.07 shall not apply to any employee who is represented by a labor union, works council, or other labor organization if the terms
and conditions of employment of any such employee are governed exclusively by any applicable Labor Agreement.
(f) Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall be deemed to: (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason; (ii) establish, amend or
modify any Parent Benefit Plan or Company Employee Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, agreement, arrangement or
contract; (iii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the consummation
of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law;
or (iv) create or confer any claims, rights or benefits (including any third-party beneficiary rights) in any Person other than the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.07, the covenants set forth in this Section 6.07 shall not apply to employees who are furloughed,
terminated, temporarily laid off, or subject to reduced hours or benefits as a result of COVID-19-related circumstances, except as otherwise required by
Applicable Law.
Section 6.08 State Takeover Laws. If any “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “moratorium” or other anti-takeover Applicable Law
becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then
each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions within their
respective authority as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.
Section 6.09 Approval of Parent. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent or the applicable Affiliate of Parent,
in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent adopting this
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.
Section 6.10 Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, any shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or
any of its Affiliates (including the Equity Investors), in favor of adoption of this Agreement and any related proposals presented by the Company at the
Stockholder Meeting, and will vote or cause to be voted the shares of Merger Sub held by it or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in favor of
adoption of this Agreement.

Section 6.11 Director and Officer Liability.
(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance in respect of acts, errors or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Company’s and
the Company’s Subsidiaries’ officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those
of such policy in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall
be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid “tail” or “runoff” policies have been obtained by either the Company or Parent, which policies provide such
persons currently covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from acts, errors or omissions
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, further, that (x) in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.11(a), neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay aggregate annual premiums in
excess of 350% of the amount paid for the policy year in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Maximum Premium”) and (y) the Company
shall not be permitted to obtain any “tail” or “runoff” officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policies with a cost in excess of the Maximum Premium. If
the aggregate premiums of any such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium. If any such prepaid policies described in this Section 6.11(a)
have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain any and all such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify (including advancement of expenses) and
hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a
Subsidiary of the Company (each an “Indemnified Party”) for any and all costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall
be advanced as they are incurred; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement
or compromise) imposed upon or incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or other Proceeding (whether
civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified Party may be involved or with which he or she may be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or
as a participant other than as a named party, including as a witness) (an “Indemnified Party Proceeding”) (A) by reason of such Indemnified Party’s
being or having been such director or officer or an employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise in connection with
any action taken or not taken at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (B) arising out of such Indemnified Party’s service in
connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she serves or has served as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary
at the request of the Company (including in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified
Party continues in such position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the
enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted under
Applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x) each indemnification or similar agreement between
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any Indemnified Party (or any other employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) in effect as of the date hereof; and (y) any indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision
set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or similar organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company as in effect
on the date hereof. To the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, that may be incurred by Indemnified Parties in connection with their successful enforcement of their rights
provided under this

Section 6.11. Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any
claim asserted or made, and for which an Indemnified Party delivers a written notice to Parent or the Surviving Corporation within such period asserting a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.11(b), shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. No Indemnified Party shall compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any Indemnified Party Proceeding for
which indemnification is being sought under this Section 6.11(b) unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any liability for any such compromise, settlement or
arrangement effected without Parent’s prior written consent.
(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and any of its successors or
assigns to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to those subject
to those provisions as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the organizational documents of the
Company as of the date hereof.
(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.
(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under any
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party or other such Person unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by Applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnified Party or other Person shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties and other Persons referenced herein shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.11).

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries), all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary,
notices, registrations and filings (including notices and filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) the delivery of required notices to, and the obtaining of
required consents or waivers from, Third Parties (provided that the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment or commercial concession to
any Third Party, or incur any liability, as a condition to (or in connection with) obtaining any such consent or waiver, unless such payment, concession or
liability is requested by Parent and is conditioned and effective only upon the Closing), and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided that (x) the Company shall not be obligated to
obtain any approval from CFIUS or any Governmental Authority under NISPOM to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and (y) Parent and Merger Sub shall not assert that the submission of any filing under the DPA or NISPOM or approval from CFIUS
is a condition to the Closing.

other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry or Proceeding by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry or Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any substantive communication to or from the FTC, DOJ, CFIUS, or any other
Governmental Authority to the extent regarding the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or regarding any such request,
inquiry or Proceeding, and provide a copy of all written communications. Subject to Applicable Law, in advance and to the extent practicable, each of
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will consult the other on all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, and shall provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and provide comments on any proposed substantive written communications to, any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or the
Company, as the case may be; provided, however, that the parties may reasonably designate competitively sensitive materials required to be shared
under this provision as outside counsel only and such information shall be provided solely to those individuals acting as outside antitrust or CFIUS
counsel for the other parties (provided that such counsel shall not disclose such information to such other parties and shall enter into a joint defense
agreement with the providing party). In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Applicable Law, in connection
with any such request, inquiry or Proceeding in respect of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party hereto will
permit authorized Representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or telephone or video conference relating to such request, inquiry or
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Authority in connection with such request, inquiry or Proceeding.
(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and TIBCO agrees to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid,
eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws in each of the
jurisdictions set forth on Section 7.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that may be required by any Governmental Authority, so as to enable the
parties hereto to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event no later than five Business Days prior to the End Date), including (i) committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, trust, or
otherwise, the

terminating, relinquishing, modifying, transferring, assigning, restructuring, or waiving existing agreements, licenses, collaborations, relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of TIBCO or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii) creating or consenting
to create or enter into any agreements, licenses, collaborations, relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations, behavioral undertakings or other
arrangements (and, in each case, to enter, or offer to enter, into agreements and stipulate to the entry of an Order or file appropriate applications with any
Governmental Authority in connection with any of the foregoing) and in the case of actions by or with respect to TIBCO or the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries or their businesses or assets, by consenting to such action by the Company; provided, however, that any such action to be taken
by (x) the Company may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (y) TIBCO or Parent may, at the discretion of Parent, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (each a “Divestiture Action”), as may be necessary or required to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any Order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to ensure that no Governmental Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, fails to do so as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than five Business Days prior
to the End Date. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in any proposal, negotiation, or offer to commit and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, any and all Divestiture Actions or otherwise to offer to take or offer to commit (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) to
take any Divestiture Action as may be required to resolve any Governmental Authority’s objections to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent shall control any such proposal negotiation or offer and any and all Divestiture
Actions; provided, further, however, that notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, Parent shall only be required to take, or agree to take,
any Divestiture Action related to the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or TIBCO and its Subsidiaries. The parties agree not to enter into any agreement
with a Governmental Authority to delay or otherwise not to consummate as soon as possible the Merger except with the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or conditioned. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including with respect to any obligations of Parent, TIBCO, or the Company otherwise set forth in this Section 6.12), in no event shall Parent, TIBCO or
any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to, and the Company shall not without the prior written consent of Parent, take or agree to take any
action, including any Divestiture Action, that is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the business of the Company and TIBCO, taken as a whole.
(e) In the event that any administrative or judicial action is commenced by a Governmental Authority challenging the Merger under Antitrust Laws
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such action seeks to prevent consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest any such action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.
(f) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor TIBCO shall, nor shall they permit Balboa Holdings LP or its or their respective Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or division thereof, if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver of any
Governmental Authority (including under Antitrust Laws) with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall permit or agree to permit any Person to obtain equity interests (or rights to obtain equity interests) in Parent, Merger
Sub or TIBCO (or Balboa Holdings LP or its or their respective Subsidiaries) if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially delay the
obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver of any Governmental Authority under
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to

Confidentiality Agreement as if a party thereto or (b) is subject to other customary confidentiality undertakings set forth in the Financing Commitment

unless and until the Effective Time has occurred.
(b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions required by the Indenture to be performed by the Company prior to the

liabilities incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any Company Notes Offers and Consent Solicitations, and no Offer to

opinions or negative assurance letters in connection with the Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations). The dealer manager, solicitation agent,
information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations will be selected by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company. The parties acknowledge and agree that the inability to make or complete any such Company Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations shall not delay the Closing or relieve Parent or Merger Sub from their obligations to consummate the Merger as required under this
Agreement.
(d) If the Closing does not occur, Parent and Merger Sub shall reimburse the Company promptly following termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms upon demand for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable and

the Company with respect to its obligations under this Section 6.20 (including any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations) (other than the
Parent Cost Exceptions) upon the written request of Parent as contemplated by this Section 6.20 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Financing
Indemnitees from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, claims, losses, penalties, damages, interest, awards
and liabilities directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the foregoing (other than the Parent Cost Exceptions) and any
information used in connection therewith (other than the historical financial statements provided by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries), in
each case, other than to the extent any such costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, awards and liabilities are

or gross negligence of any such Financing Indemnitees. This Section 6.20(d) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the Closing and any
termination of this Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Financing Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors,
estates, personal representatives, successors and assigns who are each third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.20(d).

or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorize, commit or agree to enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each
case, whether oral or written), described in Section 5.11 of this Agreement.

hereof and in no event later than 14 days prior to the Closing, on a schedule for the repatriation of cash (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) in a
commercially reasonable manner and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take the actions set forth on such schedule prior to the
Closing, and if the Closing does not occur, Parent and Merger Sub shall reimburse the Company promptly following termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms upon demand for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’,
accountants’ and consultancy fees) actually incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any actions taken by the Company

reasonable efforts to sell any marketable securities (including notes, bonds or other similar securities) then owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably proximate to the Closing Date so as to permit the net proceeds of such sale to be used by or at the direction of Parent as a potential partial
source for the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or payments in respect of Company Equity Awards under Article 2.
Section 6.24 Tender Offer(a). Upon written request by Parent prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval and subject to the consent of the
Company (which may be withheld in the Company’s reasonable discretion), the parties agree to cooperate and work in good faith to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by means of a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration (including effecting the Merger pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL) and to make such reasonable and customary amendments to this
Agreement as the parties mutually agree are necessary to reflect such structure; provided that (i) such tender offer structure shall not delay the Closing
and (ii) the inability to make or complete any such tender offer shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub from their obligations to consummate the Merger as
required under this Agreement.
Section 6.25 Treatment of TIBCO Debt. To the extent required by the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment
Letter (as amended, restated, waived or otherwise modified by the applicable Debt Financing Sources or Preferred Equity Financing Sources), TIBCO

therewith. TIBCO shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to Company not later than five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date draft TIBCO Payoff Letters and related payoff and lien release documentation for such Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall this Section 6.25 require TIBCO or any of its Subsidiaries to cause a TIBCO Credit Agreement Termination to be effective

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent (notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company);

“End Date”) (notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company); provided, however, that (i) if the Marketing Period
has commenced but not yet been completed as of the close of business on the fifth Business Day immediately prior to October 31, 2022, the End Date
shall be automatically extended until five Business Days after the final day of the Marketing Period; provided that in no event shall the End Date be
extended beyond January 31, 2023 and (ii) the End Date shall automatically be extended to January 31, 2023 if the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b) (if

Business Day immediately prior to October 31, 2022 (and the other conditions set forth in Article 7 have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing; provided that each such
condition would be satisfied if the Closing were on such date)) (and in the case of any such extension, any reference to the End Date in any provision of
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a reference to the End Date as so extended); and provided further that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose material breach of any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Merger to be consummated by the End Date;
(c) by either Parent or the Company, upon written notice to the other party, if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final and non-appealable Order, which remains in effect, permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company); provided,
however, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall not be in material breach of its obligations under Section 6.12 that has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the issuance of such final and non-appealable Order;

failure to obtain the required vote upon a final vote taken at the Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof);

prior to the earlier of the End Date or the thirtieth day following Parent’s delivery of written notice describing such breach to the Company; provided,
however, that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) if either Parent or Merger Sub is in breach of its
obligations under this Agreement such that the Company would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f);
(f) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, in the event of a breach by Parent, Merger Sub or TIBCO of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein that (i) would result in any condition set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 not being satisfied and (ii) has
not been cured prior to the earlier of the End Date or the thirtieth day following the Company’s delivery of written notice describing such breach to

to this Section 8.01(f) if the Company is in breach of its obligations under this Agreement such that Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(e);
(g) by Parent, upon written notice to the Company, at any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that any written notice of the Company’s intention to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.03(b) shall not, in and of itself, result in Parent having any termination rights pursuant to this
Section 8.01(g));
(h) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, at any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval, if (i) the Company shall have received a
Superior Proposal and the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of such Superior Proposal and authorized
the Company to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement to consummate the transaction contemplated by the Superior Proposal in
accordance with Section 6.03, and immediately following such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations in Section 6.02 and Section 6.03 with respect
to such Superior Proposal and (iii) substantially concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Company Termination Fee due to Parent in
accordance with Section 9.04; or
(i) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if (A) the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing; provided that each such condition would be satisfied if the Closing were on such date,
other than solely by virtue of Parent’s failure to effect the Closing) have been and continue to be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
waived, (B) the Company has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger, (C) the
Company shall have given Parent written notice at least five Business Days (or, if earlier, the Business Day immediately preceding the End Date) prior to
such termination stating that the Company intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(i) and (D) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the Merger within such five Business Day period after the delivery by the Company to Parent of a notice to such effect (or, if earlier, the End
Date).
Section 8.02 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect without liability of any party (or any Representative or any Financing Source Related Party of such party) to each other party hereto;

6.23 and (vi) Article 9 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 8.01. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 9.04(b), the Company shall not be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
Willful and Material Breach of any provision of this Agreement. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, (A) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms, (B) the Guarantees shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and (C)

the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time, which shall survive to the extent expressly provided for herein.
Section 9.03 Amendments and Waivers.
(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; provided, however, that without the further approval of the Company’s stockholders, no such amendment or waiver shall be made or given after
the Stockholder Approval that requires the approval of the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL unless the required further approval is
obtained.
(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Applicable Law.
Section 9.04 Fees and Expenses.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including in Section 6.17(e), Section 6.20(d) and the first sentence of Section 6.23), all costs and

(b) In the event that:
(i) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(g) or pursuant to Section 8.01(d) and at the time of such termination Parent
could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g);
(ii) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(h); or
(iii) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b) (and at the time of any such termination, the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01(b) and Section 7.01(c) have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) and Section 7.03(b)
would be satisfied if the date of such termination was the Closing Date) or Section 8.01(d) and (A) after the date hereof an Acquisition Proposal is made
to the Company or is otherwise publicly announced or disclosed and (B) within twelve months of the date of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement in respect of such Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this subsection (iii), each reference to “15%” and “85%” in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to “50%”); then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of Section 9.04(b)(i), within three Business Days after such termination, (y) in the case of Section 9.04(b)
(ii), substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) and (z) in the case of Section 9.04(b)(iii), substantially

payable only once with respect to Section 9.04(b) and not in duplication, even though such payment may be payable under one or more provisions
hereof. In the event that Parent shall receive full payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.04(b), the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or any

thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, the Company shall have no further liability, whether pursuant to a claim at law or in equity,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against the Company for
damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
matters forming the basis for such termination, provided that if the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee and Parent and/or Merger Sub
commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the Company for payment of the Company Termination Fee or any portion
thereof, then the Company shall pay Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the Company Termination Fee at the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and
the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding) (“Recovery Costs”) (provided, however, in no event shall any Recovery Costs payable under
this Section 9.04(b) exceed $7,500,000).
(c) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or Section 8.01(i) or (ii) by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.01(b) and at the time of such termination the Company could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or Section 8.01(i),
then, in any such case, Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds promptly (and in any event within
three Business Days) following such termination. In the event that the Company shall receive full payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 9.04(c), the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred
by the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and except for the expense reimbursement and indemnification
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.17(e), Section 6.20(d), and the first sentence of Section 6.23 (collectively, the “Parent
Expenses”), (x) neither Parent nor Merger Sub (or any of the Financing Source Related Parties) shall have any further liability, whether pursuant to a claim
at law or in equity, to the Company, any of its Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of the
Company, any of its Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against Parent or Merger Sub for damages or any
equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming the
basis for such termination; provided that if Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses and the Company commences a suit
which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against Parent for payment of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses, or any portions
thereof, then Parent shall pay the Company its Recovery Costs with respect thereto (provided, however, in no event shall any Recovery Costs payable
under this Section 9.04(c) exceed $7,500,000). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 9.04(c), including the
Company’s right to receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement, shall limit or otherwise affect (i) the Company’s right to specific
performance as provided in Section 9.09, or (ii) any rights of the Company under the Confidentiality Agreement or the Voting and Support Agreement.
(d) (i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses and
Recovery Costs from Parent (or the Guarantors under and in accordance with the Guarantees) (to the extent payable by Parent pursuant to Section
9.04(c)) will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Company Parties against any Parent Related Party in respect of this Agreement,
any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under

Applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Other than payment by Parent (or the Guarantors under and in accordance with the
Guaranties) of the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses and Recovery Costs (in each case, solely to the extent payable by Parent pursuant to
Section 9.04(c)), none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to the Company, any of its Affiliates or any other Company
Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any Agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby for any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated under, and the Company
may be entitled to remedies with respect to breaches or threatened breaches of, the Confidentiality Agreement). In no event will any of the Company
Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any
Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any recovery or award (other than the payment by Parent (or the Guarantors under and in accordance with the
Guaranties) of the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses and Recovery Costs to the extent payable by Parent pursuant to Section 9.04(c))against
(A) Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor; or (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Financing Source Related Parties, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited
partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub and each Guarantor (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Parent
Related Parties”), and in no event will the Company be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special,
indirect or punitive damages (other than the Parent Expenses, Recovery Costs and the Parent Termination Fee from Parent (or the Guarantors under and in
accordance with the Guaranties), in each case to the extent payable by Parent pursuant to Section 9.04(c)) against the Parent Related Parties for, or with
respect to, this Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters, the Guaranties or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach
by any Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under
Applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure; provided that the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of the Debt Financing
Sources or other financing sources to Parent or Merger Sub (or any other party thereto) under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Preferred Equity
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing, nor limit Parent or Merger Sub (or any
other party thereto) from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Debt Financing Source or other
financing source pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing. Other than the Guarantors’ obligations under the Guaranties and the Equity Commitment Letter and other
than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other
Person other than any Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Merger. Nothing in this Section 9.04(d)(i) shall limit or otherwise affect (x) the Company’s right to specific
performance as provided in Section 9.09 or (y) any rights of the Company under the Confidentiality Agreement or the Voting and Support Agreement.
(ii) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, do not constitute a penalty,
but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under this Agreement
in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
(iii) In no event will Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates be entitled to seek or obtain punitive damages against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or assignees of each of the Company and its Affiliates for, or with
respect to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including any breach by the Company), the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under Applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure.

Section 9.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 9.08.
Section 9.09 Specific Performance.
(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for
any such harm. The parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, (i) the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 9.07 to prevent breaches (or threatened
breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to effect the Closing, which shall be governed solely by the next sentence), without bond or other security
being required, this being in addition to any remedy to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 9.04, and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and without that right, none of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto further
agree that unless and until this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set
forth herein if and only if and for so long as (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided that each such condition would be satisfied if the Closing were on such date) have been and continue
to be satisfied or waived and Parent failed to consummate the Closing on the date required pursuant to the terms of Section 2.01 and (B) the Debt
Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing (or, as applicable, Alternative Financing) is available to be funded in full at the Closing and has been
funded in full or will be funded in full if the Equity Financing is funded and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Financing is
funded, then the Company shall take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to consummate the Closing pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Closing within five Business Days after receipt of such irrevocable confirmation
(such clauses (A), (B) and (C), together, the “Specific Performance Conditions”). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) in no event shall the Company be
entitled to specifically enforce (or to bring any action or proceeding in equity seeking to specifically enforce) Parent’s rights under the Equity
Commitment Letter to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to effect the Closing other than as expressly provided in the immediately preceding
sentence and (b) in no event shall the Company, Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement or to
obtain an injunction or injunctions, or to bring any other action or proceeding in equity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement against any other party hereto other than under the circumstances expressly set forth in this Section 9.09(a). Subject to the two preceding
sentences, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the
basis that any other of such parties has an adequate remedy at law or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parent’s or Merger
Sub’s obligation to effect the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub may oppose the granting of specific performance on the basis that one of the Specific
Performance Conditions has not been satisfied.

(b) The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.09, a party shall not in any respect waive its right

limit any party’s right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 9.09 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under Article 8 (and pursuing damages after such termination) to the extent otherwise permitted hereby, nor shall the commencement of any
Proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.09 or anything set forth in this Section 9.09 restrict or limit any party’s right, subject in all respects to the other
terms of this Agreement, to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 8 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 9.09(a) and subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter and/or the

Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties hereto agree to

covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by TIBCO and Merger Sub under this Agreement and the transactions and agreements
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and
agrees that any such breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or
undertaking of TIBCO or Merger Sub shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its
sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of
Parent and Merger Sub in the first instance. As applicable, references in this Section 9.11 to “Merger Sub” shall also include the Surviving Corporation

are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and
other forward-looking information furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts,
business plans and other forward-looking information), and, for the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a representation
and warranty made in Article 4 of this Agreement, that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of its stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives with respect thereto.
