The Special Meeting
Date, Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting (see page 24) 
The special meeting of stockholders of Seagen is scheduled to be held on May 30, 2023 at 12:00 p.m. (Pacific time), via the Internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SGEN2023SM. Online check-in will begin at 11:45 a.m. (Pacific time) and you should allow ample time for the
check-in procedures. At the special meeting, stockholders who owned shares of our common stock as of the record date will be able to attend, vote
and submit questions via the Internet by logging in to the virtual meeting website using the 16-digit control number provided to you on your proxy
card. If you do not have a control number, you may attend the special meeting in listen-only mode by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SGEN2023SM, but you will not be able to vote or to submit questions. Whether or not you plan to attend the
special meeting, we urge you to vote and submit your proxy in advance of the special meeting by one of the methods described in these proxy
materials. You will not be able to attend the special meeting in person.
Purpose of the Special Meeting
The special meeting is being held in order to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 
•
to adopt the merger agreement (the “merger agreement proposal”); and
 
•
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation arrangements for Seagen’s named executive officers in connection
with the merger (the “compensation proposal”).
Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote (see page 25)
Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on April 17, 2023, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date,
187,457,104 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding. Holders of record of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
of our common stock they own at the close of business on the record date.

Table of Contents
Quorum (see page 25) 
The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to
be conducted at the special meeting. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares of our common
stock will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the
special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Seagen to additional expense.
In addition, pursuant to the voting agreement, until the Expiration Time (as defined in the voting agreement), at the special meeting (and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof), Baker Bros. will cause each stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be represented in person or by
proxy at the special meeting (or cause the holders of record as of the record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order
for the Covered Shares to be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. At the close of business on the record date, the Covered
Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock.
Required Vote (see page 25) 
Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast affirmatively or negatively on the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the approval of the compensation
proposal.
As of March 1, 2023, the directors and executive officers of Seagen beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 48,795,401 shares
of our common stock (including (i) shares of our common stock for which the applicable director or executive officer has sole or shared power over
voting or investment decisions and (ii) shares of our common stock which the applicable director or executive officer has the right to acquire,
through option exercise or otherwise, within 60 days after March 1, 2023). At the close of business on March 1, 2023, the shares of our common
stock beneficially owned by the directors and executive officers of Seagen represented approximately 25.9% of the outstanding voting power of our
common stock.
In addition, pursuant to the voting agreement, until the Expiration Time, at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof),
and on any action or approval of Seagen stockholders by written consent with respect to each of the proposals, Baker Bros. will vote (including via
proxy) (or cause the holder of record on the record date to vote (including via proxy)) all of the Covered Shares: (a) in favor of the merger agreement
proposal; and (b) against (1) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to Seagen’s obligations to
complete the merger not being fulfilled or result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
Seagen contained in the merger agreement, or of Baker Bros. contained in the voting agreement, and (2) any acquisition proposal, or any agreement,
transaction or other matter that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, impede or interfere with the consummation of the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Proxies and Revocation (see page 28) 
Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may vote virtually at the special meeting, or by submitting a proxy to vote via the

If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock and your shares of our common stock are held in “street name,” you should instruct
your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares of our common stock using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee. If you fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote virtually at the special meeting, or you do not provide your bank, broker or other nominee with
instructions, as applicable, your shares of our common stock will not be voted on the merger agreement proposal, which will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement proposal. 
If you fail to vote virtually at the special meeting or fail to return your proxy card or fail to submit your proxy to vote via the Internet or by telephone,
or if your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee, and you fail to instruct your bank, broker or

You have the right to revoke a proxy at any time prior to the taking of the vote at the special meeting. You may revoke your proxy prior to the taking
of the vote at the special meeting, by submitting a new proxy to vote your shares of our common stock over the Internet or by telephone (only your
latest Internet or telephone proxy is counted), by signing a later-dated new proxy and mailing it, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on
the enclosed proxy card or by sending a written revocation of your proxy to Seagen prior to the special meeting. In addition, you may revoke your
proxy by attending the special meeting virtually and voting; however, attending the special meeting virtually will not revoke your written, Internet or
telephone proxy, as the case may be, unless you specifically request revocation or vote in person at the special meeting.

nominee, as applicable, by submitting a subsequent instruction to such bank, broker or other nominee, or you may change your vote by attending
the special meeting virtually and voting your shares of our common stock.
The Merger
A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire merger agreement carefully
because it is the principal document governing the merger. For more information on the merger agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement” beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), Merger Sub will be merged with and into Seagen. Seagen
will survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In addition, pursuant to the voting agreement, Baker Bros. has agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement,
to vote (or cause to be voted) all of the Covered Shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A copy of the voting agreement is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire voting agreement carefully because it is the principal document
governing the terms of the voting commitment from Baker Bros.
The Merger Consideration (see page 32) 
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of our common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of our common stock to be canceled or converted in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in

Table of Contents
the merger agreement and any shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by a holder who has
complied with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended, and all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the “DGCL”) with respect to such shares of our common stock, the “dissenting shares”) will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $229.00 (the “merger consideration”), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Reasons for the Merger (see pages 24 and 45) 
After careful consideration, the Board has, by resolutions unanimously adopted by the Board: (i) determined that the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Seagen and its stockholders; (ii) approved and
declared it advisable to enter into the merger agreement and the voting agreement; (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be
submitted to a vote of Seagen stockholders at the special meeting; and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, resolved to
recommend that Seagen stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement and approve the merger on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the merger agreement (the “company board recommendation”). Certain factors considered by the Board in reaching its
decision to can be found in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Reasons for the Merger.”
The Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the merger agreement proposal and “FOR” the compensation proposal.
Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC (see page 48 and Annex C)
Seagen retained Centerview Partners LLC (“Centerview”) as financial advisor to the Board in connection with the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. In connection with this engagement, the Board requested that Centerview evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of shares of our common stock (other than (i) all shares of our common stock that are owned by Seagen as
treasury shares and any shares of our common stock owned by Pfizer, Merger Sub, or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer or
Seagen and (ii) any dissenting shares (the shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), together with any shares of our common stock held by any
affiliate of Seagen or Pfizer, “excluded shares”)) of the merger consideration proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.
On March 12, 2023, Centerview rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
March 12, 2023 that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the holders
of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion, dated March 12, 2023, which describes the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this
proxy statement and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. Centerview’s financial advisory services and opinion were provided for
the information and assistance of the Board (in the directors’ capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for
purposes of its consideration of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and Centerview’s opinion addressed
only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date thereof, to the holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) of
the merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. Centerview’s opinion did not address any other term or
aspect of the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a
recommendation to

any Seagen stockholder or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the merger or otherwise act
with respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter. 
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the various assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion.
Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 58) 
In considering the recommendation of the Board that Seagen stockholders adopt the merger agreement, Seagen stockholders should be aware that
the executive officers and directors of Seagen have certain interests in the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Seagen stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and in making their recommendation that Seagen
stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement. These interests include, among others, cash severance payments that may be payable
following a qualifying termination of an executive officer’s employment under employment agreements and the treatment of Seagen equity awards.
Additional interests that were considered by the Board include the provision of indemnification and insurance arrangements pursuant to the merger
agreement. These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Seagen’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement.
Financing of the Merger (see page 64) 
Completion of the merger is not subject to a financing condition. Pfizer and Merger Sub have represented in the merger agreement that, as of the
date the closing of the merger occurs (the “closing date”), Pfizer and Merger Sub will have available sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other
sources of immediately available funds to pay the amounts required to be paid by Pfizer or Merger Sub, as applicable, pursuant to the merger
agreement.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger (see page 64) 
We expect to complete the merger in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including approval of the merger
agreement proposal by Seagen stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals and clearances. The merger is subject to various
regulatory approvals and clearances and other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Seagen or Pfizer could result in the
merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the
merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.
Regulatory Approvals and Clearances Required for the Merger (see page 65)
The respective obligations of the parties to effect the merger are subject to certain regulatory approvals and clearances. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until (i) the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof)
under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, and (ii) any agreements not to close the transaction with any governmental authority have
expired or been terminated. In addition to antitrust approval in the United States, the completion of the merger is conditioned on approvals and
clearances in accordance with antitrust laws and foreign investment laws in certain other jurisdictions.
 
-6- 
Table of Contents
The merger agreement also provides that if, prior to the effective time of the merger (i) the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”)
indicates in writing to Pfizer that it has decided to formally investigate the merger and, accordingly, requests Pfizer to submit a merger notice in the
form prescribed under the Enterprise Act 2002, (ii) the European Commission (the “EC”) indicates in writing to Pfizer that a member state of the
European Union or the EC is making, or has made, a referral of the merger to the EC under Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulation, or (iii) a merger
control, foreign direct investment, or national security inquiry or review is initiated or commenced by certain other governmental authorities,
approval of the merger by the CMA, the EC or such other governmental authority, as the case may be, will be a condition precedent to the
completion of the merger.
On April 5, 2023, Pfizer filed a briefing paper with the EC. On April 21, 2023, Pfizer filed a briefing paper with the CMA.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, the FTC or the DOJ (notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act or the expiration or termination of any agreement with the FTC or the DOJ) could take such action under antitrust laws as they deem necessary
or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger and seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Seagen or
Pfizer or imposing other conduct relief. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, any state or non-U.S. governmental authority could
take such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Seagen or Pfizer or imposing other conduct relief. Private parties may also seek
to take legal action under antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
There can be no assurance that all of the regulatory approvals described above, or any other regulatory approvals that might be required to
consummate the merger, will be sought or obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any approvals, ability to obtain the
approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of any litigation challenging such approvals. There can also be no assurance that the FTC, the DOJ
or any other governmental authority or any private party will not attempt to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds, and, if such a challenge is
made, there can be no assurance as to its result. You should read the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Required Efforts to Consummate the
Merger” for a description of the parties’ obligations with respect to regulatory approvals related to the merger.
Litigation Relating to the Merger (see page 65) 
As of April 24, 2023, we are aware of four complaints that have been filed in connection with the merger. The complaints allege, among other things,
that certain disclosures in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Seagen on April 14, 2023 in connection with the merger were materially incomplete
and misleading.
The four actions are captioned O’Dell v. Seagen Inc. et al., No. 1:23-cv-03254 (Apr. 19, 2023), filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, Boyd v. Seagen Inc. et al., No. 1:23-cv-03309 (Apr. 20, 2023), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, Wang v. Seagen Inc. et al., No. 1:23-cv-03302 (Apr. 20, 2023), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, and Ober v. Seagen Inc. et al., No. 1:23-cv-03378 (Apr. 21, 2023), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The complaints name Seagen and the current members of the Board as defendants.
The complaints allege, among other things, violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a), 78t(a), SEC Rule 14a-9, 17
C.F.R. 240.14a-9 and 17 C.F.R. § 244.100. The complaints seek, among other relief, to enjoin Seagen from consummating the merger and to be awarded
rescissory damages, including reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses.
Seagen believes that the allegations asserted in the complaints are without merit. As of April 24, 2023, Seagen was not aware of the filing of other
lawsuits challenging the merger or the proxy statement; however, additional lawsuits arising out of the merger or the proxy statement may be filed in
the future.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 95) 
The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for
such purposes, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who receives cash
in the merger in exchange for shares of our common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash that the U.S. holder receives pursuant to the merger with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares.
You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” and consult your tax advisor regarding the
particular tax consequences of the merger to you, including any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing
jurisdiction.
Appraisal Rights (see page 98) 
If the merger is completed, Seagen stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal are entitled to appraisal rights under the
DGCL in connection with the merger, provided that such stockholders fully comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, which are
further summarized in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement. In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL, which details the applicable Delaware appraisal statutes, may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available
website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. This means that you may be entitled to have the “fair value” of your shares
of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery, to be paid upon the amount determined to be “fair value,” in lieu of the amount of the merger consideration you would have
received pursuant to the merger agreement, if you follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. The ultimate amount you may
receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount you would have otherwise received under the merger
agreement if you do not seek appraisal of your shares of our common stock.
To exercise your appraisal rights with respect to your shares of our common stock, you must, among other things, deliver a written demand for
appraisal to Seagen before the vote is taken on the merger agreement proposal and you must not vote (either via the virtual meeting website or by
proxy) in favor of the merger agreement proposal with respect to such shares of our common stock, and you must continue to hold such shares of
our common stock from the record date of making the demand for appraisal through the effective time. As such, merely voting against, abstaining or
failing to vote on the merger agreement proposal will not by itself preserve your right to appraisal under the DGCL. If you fail to follow exactly the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you will lose your appraisal rights. The requirements for exercising appraisal rights are further
described in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement. In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL,
which details the applicable Delaware appraisal statute, may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety.
If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should
consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures. In view of the complexity of the DGCL, Seagen
stockholders who may wish to pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors promptly. The discussion of appraisal rights
in this proxy statement is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of
Section 262 of the DGCL, accessible without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.

any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Seagen contained in the merger agreement, or of Baker Bros.
contained in the voting agreement, (B) any acquisition proposal, or (C) any agreement, transaction or other matter that is intended to, or would
reasonably be expected to, impede or interfere with the consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger

receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of
such Seagen Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen Option (which number,
in the case of Seagen Options subject to performance goals based on stock price hurdles, will be determined based on actual
performance in accordance with the terms of such Seagen Options, with any Seagen Options that do not vest being forfeited for no
consideration), net of applicable taxes and without interest.
 
•
RSUs. At the effective time, each restricted stock unit (each a “Seagen RSU”), other than any post-signing Seagen RSU (as defined
below), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
our common stock then subject to such Seagen RSU, net of applicable taxes and without interest. Each Seagen RSU granted after the
date of the merger agreement that is unvested and outstanding as of the effective time (a “post-signing Seagen RSU”) will be
substituted automatically with a Pfizer cash-based award (each, a “Pfizer cash award”) with respect to an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the merger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such post-signing
Seagen RSU. Each Pfizer cash award will otherwise be subject to substantially the
 
-9- 
Table of Contents
same terms and conditions applicable to such post-signing Seagen RSU as of immediately prior to the effective time. For Seagen RSUs
granted in connection with Seagen’s annual grants in August 2023, one-third of the outstanding amount of such awards will vest
immediately prior to the effective time, and the remaining portion of the award will vest in equal installments on the first two annual
anniversaries of closing, or upon an earlier termination without “cause” (as defined in Seagen’s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity
Incentive Plan), due to death or disability, or for good reason.
 
•
Annual PSUs. At the effective time, each performance-based share unit (each a “Seagen PSU”) that is not a Seagen products PSU
(each, a “Seagen non-products PSU”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then vested, will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration, multiplied by
(ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen non-products PSU based on (a) for performance periods
that are complete as of the effective time, actual performance, and (b) for performance periods that are incomplete as of the effective
time, the greater of the target and actual performance, net of applicable taxes and without interest.
 
•
Product PSUs. At the effective time, each Seagen PSU with performance-based vesting conditions based on the achievement of certain
milestone-based performance conditions (each, a “Seagen products PSU”), that is unearned and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will be substituted with a Pfizer cash award subject to the same performance-based vesting requirements (a “Pfizer
performance cash award”) with respect to that number of shares of Pfizer common stock that is equal to the product of (i) the merger
consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen products PSU. Each Pfizer
performance cash award will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such Seagen products PSU as of
immediately prior to the effective time; provided, that upon a termination without “cause” (as defined in Seagen’s Amended and
Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), due to death or disability, or for good reason, the service conditions that such Pfizer performance
cash award is subject to will be waived, and the award will vest in full upon achievement of performance conditions (and will be
forfeited if such performance conditions are not achieved).
No Solicitation; Adverse Recommendation Changes (see page 77) 
Seagen has agreed that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
(ii) enter into any agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any acquisition proposal; or (iii) engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or provide any non-public information or data to, any person (other than Pfizer or any of its affiliates or
representatives) relating to any acquisition proposal, or grant any waiver or release under any restriction from making an acquisition proposal, other
than discussions solely to notify such person of the non-solicitation terms of the merger agreement or to clarify the terms and conditions of such
proposal or offer.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, Seagen and its representatives may
furnish non-public information concerning Seagen’s business, properties or assets to any person in accordance with a confidentiality agreement
with terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Seagen than those contained in its confidentiality agreement with Pfizer and may
participate in discussions and negotiations with such person concerning an acquisition proposal if, but only if, such person has submitted a bona
fide proposal to Seagen relating to such acquisition proposal that (i) did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the
merger agreement, and (ii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors, either constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a superior proposal.
Prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, if Seagen receives an acquisition proposal, the Board may effect an adverse
recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement to enter an agreement
 
-10- 
Table of Contents
providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any superior proposal if, but only if, the Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal and determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to Seagen stockholders in accordance with law, so long as Seagen has first complied with certain terms of the merger agreement, including (i)
notifying Pfizer of its intent with respect to a superior proposal and negotiating with Pfizer in good faith regarding adjustments proposed by Pfizer to
the terms of the merger agreement for a period of four business days, subject to additional two-business-day negotiation periods if the terms of the
superior proposal are materially revised during such negotiation period and (ii) in the case of termination of the merger agreement to accept a
superior proposal, paying the termination fee to Pfizer and immediately following such termination entering into a binding definitive agreement for
such superior proposal.
In addition to the foregoing, prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, the Board may effect an adverse recommendation change
in response to an intervening event if, but only if, the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to make
an adverse recommendation change on account of an intervening event would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, so
long as Seagen has first complied with certain terms of the merger agreement, including notifying Pfizer of its intent and negotiating with Pfizer in
good faith regarding adjustments proposed by Pfizer to the terms of the merger agreement for a period of four business days.
See pages 77 and 78, respectively, for definitions of “acquisition proposal” and “superior proposal” as used in the merger agreement.
Conditions to the Completion of the Merger (see page 84) 
The respective obligations of Seagen, Pfizer and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or written waiver of certain
customary conditions, including the receipt of any approvals or clearances applicable to the consummation of the merger in accordance with the
HSR Act and other antitrust laws and foreign investment laws in certain jurisdictions, the expiration or termination of any agreement with any
governmental authority not to consummate the transaction, the receipt of the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, the absence of legal
prohibitions, no material adverse effect having occurred that is continuing, the accuracy of the parties’ representations and warranties subject to
certain specified materiality standards, and the parties’ compliance in all material respects with their respective obligations under the merger
agreement.
Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 86) 
Subject to certain exceptions, the merger agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated thereby may be abandoned at any time
prior to the effective time, whether before or after the requisite Seagen stockholder approval is obtained:
 
•
by mutual written consent of Pfizer and Seagen;
 
•
by either Pfizer or Seagen:
 
•
if a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority will have issued any restraint;
 
•
if the closing has not occurred on or prior to the outside date; or
 
•
if the requisite Seagen stockholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof;
 
•
by Pfizer or Merger Sub:
 
 
-11- 
Table of Contents
•
if there has been a breach by Seagen of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of
Seagen set forth in the merger agreement that would result in a failure of certain conditions to Pfizer’s or Merger Sub’s obligations
to close, subject to cure periods specified in the merger agreement; or
 
•
if at any time prior to the receipt of the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, the Board has effected an adverse recommendation
change;
 
•
by Seagen:
 
•
if there has been a breach by Pfizer or Merger Sub of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement of Pfizer or Merger Sub set forth in the merger agreement that would result in a failure of certain conditions to Seagen’s
obligations to close, subject to cure periods specified in the merger agreement; or
 
•
at any time prior to the receipt of the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, in order to accept a superior proposal in accordance
with the merger agreement, provided that Seagen has paid the termination fee.
A termination fee equal to $1,646 million will be payable by Seagen to Pfizer if:
 
•
Pfizer terminates the merger agreement because, prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, the Board makes an
adverse recommendation change;
 
•
Seagen terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal in accordance with the merger agreement; or
 
•
(i) Pfizer or Seagen, as applicable, terminates the merger agreement because (A) the closing has not occurred by the outside date; (B)
the requisite Seagen stockholder approval is not obtained; or (C) of a breach by Seagen of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement of Seagen set forth in the merger agreement and, at the time of such termination, the requisite
Seagen stockholder approval has not been obtained, (ii) prior to such termination, an acquisition proposal has been publicly
announced and not publicly withdrawn at least four business days prior to the special meeting, and (iii) within 12 months of such
termination, Seagen enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal that is ultimately consummated or an
acquisition proposal is consummated (provided that, for such purposes, the references to “20%” in the definition of acquisition
proposal are deemed to be references to “50%”).
A reverse termination fee equal to $2,224 million will be payable by Pfizer to Seagen if:
 
•
Seagen or Pfizer terminates the merger agreement because (i) of a restraint (solely to the extent arising under any antitrust laws and
foreign investment laws), or (ii) the merger has not occurred by the outside date;
 
•
the requisite Seagen stockholder approval has been obtained;
 
•
the regulatory approval condition or the no law or order condition (solely to the extent in respect of, pursuant to or arising under any
antitrust laws or foreign investment laws) has not been satisfied;
 
•
the remaining conditions to Pfizer’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to close, other than the regulatory approval condition and the no law
or order condition, are satisfied; and
 
•
a breach by Seagen of its obligations with respect to regulatory matters has not contributed materially and substantially to the
applicable restraint that gives rise to the termination right or the failure of the regulatory approval condition or the no law or order
condition to be satisfied.

Remedies (see page 89) 
The parties have agreed (i) that each party will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of the merger agreement in any action without the posting of a bond or
undertaking, and (ii) that the parties waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and any other
objections to specific performance of the merger agreement.
Market Price of Common Stock (see page 91) 
If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to $229.00 (disregarding reduction for any applicable withholding
taxes), for each eligible share owned by you (unless you have properly exercised, and not lost, your appraisal rights with respect to such shares of
our common stock), which represents a premium of approximately 42% to the closing price of $161.37 per share of our common stock on February 24,
2023, the last trading day prior to the first media accounts regarding a possible acquisition of Seagen by Pfizer, and a premium of approximately 54%
to the 30-trading day volume-weighted average share price of $148.42 per share of our common stock on that same date.
On April 21, 2023, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was first mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for our common
stock on the Nasdaq was $203.80 per share of our common stock. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common stock in
connection with voting your shares of our common stock.

Seagen Inc._20230424_DEFM14A_20812583_4650531.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as a stockholder of Seagen, may have regarding the merger agreement, the merger, the
special meeting and the proposals being considered at the special meeting. Seagen urges you to carefully read the remainder of this proxy statement
because the information in this section does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger agreement, the
merger and the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference
into, this proxy statement.
 
Q.
Why am I receiving these materials?
 
A.
The Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to Seagen stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be
voted at the special meeting.
 
Q.
What is the purpose of the special meeting?
 
A.
At the special meeting, stockholders will consider and act upon the matters outlined in the notice of meeting on the cover page of this proxy
statement, namely:
 
•
the merger agreement proposal; and
 
•
the compensation proposal.
 
Q.
Where and when is the special meeting?
 
A.
The special meeting of stockholders of Seagen is scheduled to be held on May 30, 2023 at 12:00 p.m. (Pacific time), via the Internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SGEN2023SM. Online check-in will begin at 11:45 a.m. (Pacific time), and you should allow ample time for the
check-in procedures. At the special meeting, stockholders who owned shares of our common stock as of the record date will be able to attend, vote
and submit questions via the Internet by logging in to the virtual meeting website using the 16-digit control number provided to you on your proxy
card. If you do not have a control number, you may attend the special meeting in listen-only mode by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SGEN2023SM, but you will not be able to vote or to submit questions. Whether or not you plan to attend the
special meeting, we urge you to vote and submit your proxy in advance of the special meeting by one of the methods described in these proxy
materials. You will not be able to attend the special meeting in person.
 
Q.
How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
 
A.
The Board recommends that you vote as follows:
 
•
“FOR” the merger agreement proposal; and
 
•
“FOR” the compensation proposal.
In considering the recommendation of the Board to vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal, Seagen stockholders should be aware that
Seagen’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Seagen
stockholders generally. For a more complete description of these interests, see the information provided in the section entitled “The Merger—
Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement.
 
Q.
What will I receive in the merger?
 
A.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of our common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares
 
-14-Table of Contents
of our common stock to be cancelled or converted in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and
any dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $229.00, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes.
 
Q.
How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Seagen common stock prior to the announcement of the merger?
 
A.
The merger consideration of $229.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 42% to the closing price of $161.37 per share of our common
stock on February 24, 2023, the last trading day prior to the first media accounts regarding a possible acquisition of Seagen by Pfizer, and a premium
of approximately 54% to the 30-trading day volume-weighted average share price of $148.42 per share of our common stock on that same date.
On April 21, 2023, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was first mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for our
common stock on the Nasdaq was $203.80 per share of our common stock. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common
stock in connection with voting your shares of our common stock.
 
Q.
What will happen in the merger?
 
A.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into Seagen at the effective time. At the effective time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
cease, and Seagen will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer. As a result of the merger, our
common stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer have any interest in the future earnings or growth of Seagen or Pfizer. In
addition, our common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Seagen will no longer be required to file
periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to our common stock, in each case, in accordance with
applicable law, rules and regulations.
 
Q.
What vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?
 
A.
Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement proposal.
In addition, pursuant to the voting agreement, until the Expiration Time, at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof),
Baker Bros. will cause each stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting (or cause
the holders of record as of the record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Covered Shares to be counted
as present for purposes of establishing a quorum and to cause the Covered Shares to be voted in favor of the merger agreement proposal. At the
close of business on the record date, the Covered Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock.
 
Q.
What vote is required to approve (on a non-binding, advisory basis) the compensation proposal?
 
A.
Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast affirmatively or negatively on the matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the approval of the compensation proposal.
 
-15-
Table of Contents
Q.
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Seagen’s named executive officers that relates to the merger?
 
A.
The SEC rules require Seagen to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that will, or may be made to
Seagen’s named executive officers in connection with the merger. For additional information, see the section entitled “Advisory Vote on Named
Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation Arrangements (Proposal 2)” beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement.
 
Q.
What will happen if Seagen stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal?
 
A.
The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder
may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the
compensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Seagen, Pfizer or Merger Sub. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is
adopted by Seagen stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to Seagen’s named executive officers
to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their respective compensation agreements and arrangements even if the stockholders do not
approve the compensation proposal.
 
Q.
Are there any voting agreements related to the merger?
 
A.
Baker Bros. has entered into the voting agreement with Pfizer and Seagen, pursuant to which it has agreed, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the voting agreement, to, among other things: (I) cause each stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be
represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof) (or cause the holders of record on
any applicable record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Covered Shares to be counted as present for
purposes of establishing a quorum and to cause the Covered Shares to be voted in favor of the merger agreement proposal; and (II) vote (including
via proxy) (or cause the holder of record on the record date to vote (including via proxy)) all of the Covered Shares: (a) in favor of the merger
agreement proposal; and (b) against (1) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to Seagen’s
obligations to complete the merger not being fulfilled or result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Seagen contained in the merger agreement, or of Baker Bros. contained in the voting agreement and (2) any acquisition proposal, or
any agreement, transaction or other matter that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, impede or interfere with the consummation of
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
At the close of business on the record date, the Covered Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common
stock.
 
Q.
Do any of Seagen’s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger agreement that are different from, or in addition to, my
interests as a Seagen stockholder?
 
A.
In considering the recommendation of the Board that Seagen stockholders adopt the merger agreement, Seagen stockholders should be aware that
the executive officers and directors of Seagen have certain interests in the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Seagen stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and in making their recommendation that Seagen
stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement. These interests include, among others, cash severance payments that may be payable
following a qualifying termination of an executive officer’s employment under employment agreements and the treatment of Seagen equity awards.
Additional interests that were considered by the Board include the provision of indemnification and insurance arrangements pursuant to the merger
agreement. These interests
 
-16-
Table of Contents
are discussed in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning
on page 58 of this proxy statement.
 
Q.
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 
A.
We expect to complete the merger in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including the approval of Seagen
stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals and clearances. The merger is subject to various regulatory approvals and clearances and
other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Seagen or Pfizer could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or
not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the
merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.
 
Q.
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger?
 
A.
The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for
such purposes, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page
95 of this proxy statement) who receives cash in the merger in exchange for shares of our common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that the U.S. holder receives pursuant to the merger
with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.
You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” and consult your tax adviser regarding the
particular tax consequences of the merger to you, including any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing
jurisdiction.
 
Q.
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 
A.
The record date for the special meeting is April 17, 2023. Only common stockholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to
attend and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on all
matters that come before the special meeting.
 
Q.
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Seagen common stock after the record date but before the special meeting?
 
A.
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date on which the merger is expected to be completed.
If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of our common stock, and each of
you notifies Seagen in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration, if the merger is
completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the
special meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and
return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in
accordance with the instructions detailed in the section entitled “The Special Meeting” beginning on page 24 of this proxy statement).
 
Q.
Who may attend the special meeting?
 
A.
Only stockholders as of the close of business on April 17, 2023, or their duly appointed proxies, and invited guests of Seagen may attend the
special meeting via the virtual meeting website. “Street name” holders (those whose shares of our common stock are held through a broker, bank or
other nominee) who wish to
 
-17-
Table of Contents
vote at the special meeting must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote your
shares of our common stock at the special meeting.
 
Q.
Who is soliciting my vote?
 
A.
The Board is soliciting your proxy, and Seagen will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) has been retained
to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid approximately $25,000 in total and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of proxies
and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians and other like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of our common
stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by
telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by Seagen or certain of Seagen’s
directors, officers and employees.
 
Q.
What do I need to do now?
 
A.
Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including its annexes. Whether or
not you expect to attend the special meeting by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, please submit a proxy to vote your shares of
our common stock as promptly as possible so that your shares of our common stock may be represented and voted at the special meeting. A failure
to vote your shares of our common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.
 
Q.
How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?
 
A.
If you are a stockholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote at the special meeting:
 
•
Internet: To vote over the Internet, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote over the Internet, you do not have to mail
in a proxy card.
 
•
Telephone: To vote by telephone, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote by telephone, you do not have to mail in a
proxy card.
 
•
Mail: To vote by mail, complete, sign and date a proxy card and return it promptly in the postage-paid envelope provided. If you return your
signed proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your shares of our common stock as you direct.
 
•
Virtually During the Special Meeting: To vote your shares of our common stock during the special meeting, click on the vote button
provided on the screen and follow the instructions provided. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the special meeting during the
check-in or meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be posted on the log in page.
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, as applicable, we urge you to vote
by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the special meeting if you have already voted by proxy. We encourage you to vote
over the Internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. 
 
Q.
How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)?
 
A.
If your shares of our common stock are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in “street name,” you will receive a
form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares of our common stock should be voted. You should contact
your broker, bank or other nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke your instructions.
 
-18-
Table of Contents
Q.
Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy?
 
A.
Yes. You have the right to revoke a proxy at any time prior to the taking of the vote at the special meeting. You may revoke your proxy prior to the
taking of the vote at the special meeting, by submitting a new proxy to vote your shares of our common stock over the Internet or by telephone
(only your latest Internet or telephone proxy is counted), by signing a later-dated new proxy and mailing it, in each case, in accordance with the
instructions on the enclosed proxy card or by sending a written revocation of your proxy to Seagen prior to the special meeting. In addition, you
may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting virtually and voting; however, attending the special meeting virtually will not revoke your
written, Internet or telephone proxy, as the case may be, unless you specifically request revocation or vote in person at the special meeting.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in “street name,” you may change your instruction to your bank, broker or other
nominee, as applicable, by submitting a subsequent instruction to such bank, broker or other nominee, or you may also change your vote by
obtaining a legal proxy, executed in your favor from the holder of record, and voting your shares in person at the special meeting.
 
Q.
If the merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of Seagen common stock?
 
A.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each eligible share will be automatically canceled and
will cease to exist, and will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes. If your shares of our common stock are evidenced by stock certificates, after the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal
and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of our common stock.
Holders of book-entry shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive the merger
consideration. If your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions
from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange
for the merger consideration.
 
Q.
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
 
A.
No. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of common stock now or with your proxy card.
 
Q.
Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares of Seagen’s common
stock?
 
A.
Stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL in connection with the merger if they take certain actions and meet certain conditions. For additional information, see the section entitled
“Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement. In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, which details the applicable
Delaware appraisal statute, may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.
Failure to strictly comply with all procedures required by Section 262 of the DGCL will result in a loss of your right to appraisal. We encourage you
to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety and, in view of their complexity, to promptly consult with your legal and financial advisors if
you wish to pursue your appraisal rights in connection with the merger.
 
Q.
How many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the special meeting?
 
A.
The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled
 
-19-
Table of Contents
to vote thereat will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be
present at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Seagen to additional expense.
Pursuant to the voting agreement, Baker Bros. has agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement, to cause
each stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or
postponement thereof) (or cause the holders of record on any applicable record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in
order for the Covered Shares to be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. At the close of business on the record date, the
Covered Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock.
 
Q.
What if I abstain from voting?
 
A.
If you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal, your shares of our common stock will
still be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. If you abstain from voting or fail to vote your shares of our common stock (including
the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in “street
name” by a broker to give voting instructions to the broker), that abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST”
the merger agreement proposal. However, abstentions and a failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of our common stock
will have no effect on the approval of the compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the
shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the merger agreement proposal; and (2) “FOR” the compensation
proposal.
 
Q.
What is a broker non-vote?
 
A.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but will have no effect on the
compensation proposal. Broker non-votes are shares of our common stock held by brokers that are present in person or by proxy at the special
meeting, but with respect to which the broker is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares of our common stock how to vote on a
particular proposal, and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers do not have discretionary voting
authority with respect to any of the proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in “street
name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, then those shares of our common stock will not be present in person or by proxy at the
special meeting. For shares of our common stock held in “street name,” only shares of our common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the special
meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, Seagen does not expect any broker non-votes at the special
meeting.
 
Q.
What is a proxy?
 
A.
A proxy is a Seagen stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares of our common stock owned by such Seagen stockholder on
their behalf. If you are a Seagen stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares of our common stock beneficially in “street name”, you should follow the
voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
 
-20-
Table of Contents
Q.
If a Seagen stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of our common stock voted?
 
A.
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies will vote your shares of our
common stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your
shares of our common stock should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come
before the special meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the
shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the merger agreement proposal; and (2) “FOR” the compensation
proposal.
 
Q.
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
 
A.
This means you own shares of our common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you may
own some shares of our common stock directly as a stockholder of record and other shares of our common stock through a broker or you may own
shares of our common stock through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign
and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order
to vote all of the shares of our common stock you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit
your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
 
Q.
Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?
 
A.
No. Because any shares of our common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares
you hold of record, any shares of our common stock so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of our common stock you hold
of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor,
you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of our common stock because they are held in a different
form of record ownership. Shares of our common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the
entity. Shares of our common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.
 
Q.
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?
 
A.
If you are unable to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card or to vote over the Internet or
by telephone.
 
Q.
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
 
A.
Seagen intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and to publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will
be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Seagen files with the SEC are publicly available.
 
Q.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
 
A.
If the merger agreement is not adopted by Seagen stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Seagen stockholders will not
receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, shares of our common stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the Nasdaq. The merger agreement provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain
 
-21-
Table of Contents
circumstances, Seagen may be required to pay to Pfizer a termination fee of $1,646 million in cash. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement
—Termination Fee” beginning on page 87 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which such a termination fee may be
required to be paid. The merger agreement also provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain other circumstances, Pfizer
may be required to pay to Seagen a reverse termination fee of $2,224 million in cash. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Reverse
Termination Fee” beginning on page 88 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which such a reverse termination fee
may be required to be paid.
 
Q.
How can I obtain additional information about Seagen?
 
A.
Seagen will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2022, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, without charge to any stockholder
who makes a written request to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE, Bothell, Washington 98021. Seagen’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
and other SEC filings may also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on Seagen’s Investor Relations website at https://investor.seagen.com. Seagen’s
website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this
proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.
 
Q.
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another stockholder?
 
A.
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to
two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Seagen and some brokers
may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple stockholders who request a copy and share an
address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in
householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you
wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares of our common stock are held in a
brokerage account or Seagen if you are a stockholder of record by sending a written request to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE,
Bothell, Washington 98021 or calling (425) 527-4000. In addition, Seagen will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or
telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement.
 
Q.
Who should I contact if I have any questions?
 
A.
If you have questions about the merger or the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or desire additional copies of this proxy statement
or additional proxy cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you should contact:

Information set forth in this proxy statement and the other documents referenced herein, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected
timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction between Seagen, on the one hand, and Pfizer and Merger Sub, on the other hand, constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results or
developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these estimates and statements. Such estimates and statements include, but are not
limited to, statements about the benefits of the transaction, including future financial and operating results, Seagen’s plans, objectives, expectations and
intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of
Seagen and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could
give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; the risk that Seagen stockholders may not approve the transaction; the risk that the necessary
regulatory approvals and clearances may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; risks that any of the other
closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all; risks related to potential litigation brought in connection
with the proposed transaction; risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of Seagen and its business, operations, financial
condition and the industry in which it operates; risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed
merger; effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed merger on the ability of Seagen to retain customers and retain and hire key
personnel and maintain relationships with suppliers and partners, and on Seagen’s operating results and businesses generally; and risks related to the
potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the parties to the proposed merger or the proposed merger.
Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in Seagen’s filings with the SEC. Seagen is under no obligation, and expressly disclaims
any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Persons reading this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof.

After careful consideration, the Board has, by resolutions unanimously adopted by the Board: (i) determined that the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Seagen and its stockholders; (ii) approved and declared it advisable to
enter into the merger agreement and the voting agreement; (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote of Seagen
stockholders at the special meeting; and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, resolved to make the company board
recommendation. Certain factors considered by the Board in reaching its decision can be found in the section entitled “The Merger—Recommendation of
the Board of Directors; Reasons for the Merger, beginning on page 45 of this proxy statement.”
Our stockholders must approve the merger agreement proposal in order for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement
proposal, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read
carefully and in its entirety.
The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder may
vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the
compensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Seagen, Pfizer or Merger Sub. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted
by Seagen stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to
 
-24-Table of Contents
Seagen’s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their respective compensation agreements and arrangements
even if the stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal.
The Board unanimously recommends that Seagen stockholders vote “FOR” each of the above proposals.

The presence at the special meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares
of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat will constitute a quorum. Any shares of our common stock held by Seagen are
not considered to be outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. If
a quorum is not present, then either (i) the chair of the special meeting on such person’s own motion, or (ii) holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting who are present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote
thereat may adjourn the special meeting to another place (if any), date or time. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate
an adjournment or postponement and will subject Seagen to additional expense. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for
the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any adjournment of the special meeting. However, if a new record date is set for the
adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting,
your shares of our common stock will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.
In addition, pursuant to the voting agreement, until the Expiration Time, at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), Baker
Bros. will cause each stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting (or cause the holders
of record as of the record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Covered Shares to be counted as present for
purposes of establishing a quorum. At the close of business on the record date, the Covered Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding

Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
affirmatively or negatively on the matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the approval of the compensation proposal.
As of March 1, 2023, the directors and executive officers of Seagen beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 48,795,401 shares of

investment decisions and (ii) shares of our common stock which the applicable director or executive officer has the right to acquire,

through option exercise or otherwise, within 60 days after March 1, 2023). At the close of business on March 1, 2023, the shares of our common stock
beneficially owned by the directors and executive officers of Seagen represented approximately 25.9% of the outstanding voting power of our common
stock.
In addition, pursuant to the voting agreement, until the Expiration Time, at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), and
on any action or approval of Seagen stockholders by written consent with respect to each of the proposals, Baker Bros. will vote (including via proxy) (or
cause the holder of record on the record date to vote (including via proxy)) all of the Covered Shares: (a) in favor of the merger agreement proposal; and
(b) against (1) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to Seagen’s obligations to complete the
merger not being fulfilled or result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Seagen contained in
the merger agreement, or of Baker Bros. contained in the voting agreement, and (2) any acquisition proposal, or any agreement, transaction or other

An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special meeting, abstentions will be
counted in determining whether a quorum is present. If a stockholder abstains from voting or fails to vote its shares of our common stock (including the
failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in “street name” by a
broker to give voting instructions to the broker), that abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the
merger agreement proposal. However, abstentions and a failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of our common stock will have no
effect on the approval of the compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but will have no effect on the compensation

broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of
the proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in “street name” does not give voting

counted as a vote in favor of such proposal. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are routine matters for which brokers
may have discretionary authority to vote, Seagen does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the shares

Seagen stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the merger, provided that such stockholders comply with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. If the merger is completed, any Seagen stockholder who does not vote in favor of the merger agreement
proposal and who otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL has the right to seek appraisal of such person’s shares of our
common stock and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of such person’s shares of our common stock, as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, to be paid upon the amount determined to be “fair value,” in lieu of the amount of the merger consideration you would have received pursuant
to the merger agreement. The ultimate amount you may receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount you would
have otherwise received under the merger agreement if you do not seek appraisal of your shares of our common stock.
To exercise your appraisal rights with respect to your shares of our common stock, you must, among other things, deliver a written demand for appraisal
to Seagen before the vote is taken on the merger agreement proposal, and you must not vote (either via live webcast at the virtual meeting website or by
proxy) in favor of the merger agreement proposal with respect to such shares of our common stock, and you must continue to hold such shares of our
common stock from the record date of making the demand for appraisal through the effective time. As such, merely voting against, abstaining or failing to
vote on the merger agreement proposal will not by itself preserve your right to appraisal under the DGCL. If you fail to follow exactly the procedures set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you will lose your appraisal rights. The requirements for exercising appraisal rights are further described in the section
entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement. In addition, a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL, which details the applicable
Delaware appraisal statute, may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. If you hold your
shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank,
broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures. In view of the complexity of the DGCL, Seagen stockholders who may wish to pursue
appraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors promptly. The discussion of appraisal rights in this proxy statement is not a full summary

If the merger agreement is not approved by Seagen stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Seagen stockholders will not
receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Seagen will remain an independent public company,
shares of our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and be registered under the Exchange Act, and Seagen will continue to
file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, Seagen expects that management will, for the foreseeable future, operate
Seagen’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that Seagen stockholders will continue to be subject to the same
risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the competitive industry in which Seagen
operates and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger not to be completed, it is possible
that the price of our common stock will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return
to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares
of our common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Board will continue to evaluate and review Seagen’s business operations, properties and
capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the merger
agreement is not approved by Seagen stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other
transaction acceptable to Seagen will be offered, or that Seagen’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, Seagen may be required to pay Pfizer a termination fee in an amount
equal to $1,646 million. The merger agreement also provides that Pfizer

circumstances. See the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” beginning on page 87 of this proxy statement and “The Merger

Background of the Merger",40,41
Seagen Inc._20230424_DEFM14A_20812583_4650531.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Board and Seagen’s executive leadership team regularly meet and consider Seagen’s long-term strategy, including Seagen’s efforts to build and scale
a global oncology company that develops and commercializes new and innovative targeted treatments for cancer patients. As part of their regular review,
the Board and Seagen’s executive leadership team continually assess Seagen’s business, financial prospects and opportunities to enhance stockholder
value, including Seagen’s ongoing buildout of a new biomanufacturing facility in Everett, Washington, Seagen’s products and pipeline, additional global
expansion of clinical and commercial capabilities, capital raising opportunities, prospective acquisition and licensing transactions, and other strategic
opportunities.
During October 2019, Seagen’s then chairman and chief executive officer met with a senior executive of a global biopharmaceutical company which we
refer to as “Company A”, at which time Company A suggested exploring a potential strategic transaction with Seagen.
Beginning in early December 2019 and continuing through March 2020, representatives of Seagen, including Seagen’s then chairman and chief executive
officer, had a number of communications and meetings with representatives of Company A, which made a series of six proposals to Seagen. These
proposals ranged from (i) a potential strategic collaboration between Company A and Seagen with respect to certain of Seagen’s commercialized and
pipeline products together with a purchase by Company A of a 20% equity stake in Seagen, (ii) an acquisition of Seagen by Company A where,
immediately prior to such acquisition, Seagen would spin off to Seagen stockholders a new company (a “SpinCo”) that would serve as a discovery and
early development engine, and (iii) an acquisition of Seagen by Company A for $200 per share in cash. Between December 1, 2019 and March 31, 2020, our
common stock traded in a price range between $90.57 and $124.32 per share.
The Board met regularly from December 2019 through April 2020 to discuss these proposals and provide guidance and direction directly to Seagen’s then
chairman and chief executive officer. The Board meetings from January 18, 2020 through April 2020 included representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP,
Seagen’s outside M&A counsel (“Sullivan & Cromwell”), which provided legal advice to the Board. At a Board meeting on January 27, 2020, it was the
consensus of the Board that Seagen should engage Centerview to support management in preparing a standalone financial valuation of Seagen. The
Board selected Centerview for this mandate based on, among other considerations, Centerview’s reputation, experience and knowledge of the
biopharmaceutical industry and experience with merger and acquisition transactions in that industry. At a meeting on February 4, 2020, Seagen’s chief
financial officer reviewed with the directors management’s projections for the future financial performance of Seagen on a standalone basis. At a meeting
on March 13, 2020, representatives of Centerview reviewed with the directors various preliminary financial analyses concerning the then current proposal
from Company A.
At each juncture in these discussions with Company A, it was the consensus of the Board that (a) Company A’s proposals with respect to a SpinCo were
not acceptable, and (b) the per-share transaction prices proposed by Company A in respect of an acquisition of Seagen by Company A were not
adequate. In mid-April 2020, Seagen and Company A ceased discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Seagen, including any spin off. Throughout
the remainder of 2020 and into the spring of 2022, Seagen and the Board continued to evaluate strategic collaborations with various global
biopharmaceutical companies to enhance stockholder value and executed on certain of these collaborations over that period. These executed
collaborations included (a) a September 2020 strategic collaboration providing for (i) the co-development and co-commercialization of Seagen’s antibody-
drug conjugate (“ADC”) ladiratuzumab vedotin globally, for which Seagen received a $600 million upfront payment, and (ii) an acquisition of $1 billion
 
-34-Table of Contents
of our common stock at a price of $200 per share, (b) an August 2021 strategic collaboration providing for the exclusive worldwide license and co-
development of disitamab vedotin, for which Seagen made a $200 million upfront payment, and (c) a March 2022 strategic collaboration providing for the
co-design, development, and commercialization of ADCs for up to three cancer targets.
On February 4, 2022, Seagen’s then chairman and chief executive officer met with representatives of Company A at Company A’s request. At this meeting,
representatives of Company A expressed Company A’s interest in acquiring Seagen at a transaction price in the range of $235 to $245 per share. Seagen’s
then chairman and chief executive officer communicated this indication of interest to the Board, and on February 7, 2022, the Board met, together with
members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Centerview. Seagen’s then chairman and chief executive officer updated
the directors on his discussion with Company A, including Company A’s indication of interest. A discussion ensued regarding Seagen’s prospects as a
standalone company and the range of transaction values mentioned by Company A. On February 10, 2022, the Board met again, together with members of
senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Centerview. Representatives of Centerview reviewed various preliminary financial
analyses with the Board.
On February 17, 2022, the Board met again, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell. After discussion,
the consensus of the Board was that Seagen’s then chairman and chief executive officer should continue discussions with Company A regarding a
potential transaction, and the Board provided Seagen’s then chairman and chief executive officer with guidance and direction for negotiating the financial
and other terms for a potential transaction.
On both February 21 and February 22, 2022, Seagen’s then chairman and chief executive officer and Company A’s chief executive officer discussed
Company A’s indication of interest, including perspectives on financial and other terms for a potential transaction.
On February 24, 2022, at the direction of Seagen, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell provided to representatives of Company A’s outside counsel a
term sheet containing certain proposed provisions for a potential merger agreement, which focused on transaction certainty. Representatives of Seagen
and Company A, together with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Company A’s outside M&A counsel, continued to negotiate transaction
certainty provisions in various discussions during March and April, 2022. During this period of discussion of a potential transaction, Seagen and
Company A entered into a non-disclosure agreement, the terms of which included a standstill obligation that expired upon Seagen’s entry into the merger
agreement.
On March 14, 2022, representatives of Seagen gave a technical presentation to representatives of Company A regarding Seagen’s programs and
technology.
On April 12, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management. At this meeting, the directors discussed the status of the potential
transaction with Company A.
On May 5, 2022, Company A submitted a written proposal to acquire Seagen at a transaction price of $230 per share in cash, subject to completion of
confirmatory due diligence, together with certain proposed provisions for a potential merger agreement. Later on May 5, 2022, the Board met to discuss
Company A’s proposal. Members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview, MTS Health Partners LP (“MTS”) and
Seagen’s outside securities counsel attended the meeting. Prior to the meeting, the Board determined to engage MTS to provide financial advice based
on, among other considerations, MTS’s familiarity with Seagen, its business and its products. Felix Baker, then Seagen’s lead independent director,
updated the directors on Company A’s proposal, and the directors discussed this proposal. A representative of Centerview summarized for the directors
the preliminary financial analyses reviewed with the directors in February 2022. The directors, in consultation with representatives of Centerview,
discussed whether one or more additional third parties, including global biopharmaceutical companies, could undertake an acquisition of Seagen.
Representatives of Centerview and MTS commented on the financial capability of several such companies and provided their perspective concerning
those companies’ probable level of strategic interest in Seagen, as well as their respective abilities

and probable level of motivation for commencing and completing negotiations and diligence on a timely basis. After discussion, it was the consensus of
the Board that Dr. Baker should assume the lead role in negotiating on behalf of Seagen with Company A.
On May 6, 2022, the Board met to further discuss Company A’s proposal. Members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell,
Centerview, MTS, and Seagen’s outside securities counsel attended the meeting. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that while certain
portions of Company A’s proposal were acceptable, Dr. Baker should convey to Company A that the transaction price proposed by Company A was not
acceptable. Later on May 6, 2022, Dr. Baker conveyed a counterproposal to Company A, indicating that he would be prepared to recommend to the Board
that it accept certain terms set out in Company A’s proposal, provided that the transaction price was at least $235 per share.
On May 9, 2022, Company A reiterated its previously proposed transaction price of $230 per share.
On May 11, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Dr.
Baker updated the directors on the discussions with Company A. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Dr. Baker should communicate
to Company A that while Seagen did not agree to the transaction price being proposed by Company A, Seagen was prepared to provide additional
detailed information to Company A and undertake preliminary contract negotiations with a view to enhancing the transaction price and terms. The
directors also discussed the potential benefits and risks of contacting third parties to solicit proposals to acquire Seagen. Representatives of Centerview
and MTS expressed their view as to the viability of receiving actionable bids from private equity sponsors and reviewed with the directors various global
biopharmaceutical companies in terms of their financial ability to undertake an acquisition of this size, likely strategic interest in Seagen, and ability to
commence and complete an acquisition process expeditiously. The directors, in consultation with representatives of Centerview, MTS and Sullivan &
Cromwell, discussed the likelihood that a party could provide a proposal that was competitive with Company A’s proposal, the utility of discussions with
another party in maintaining leverage on Company A, the utility of developing alternative strategic options, and the risk and potential impact of a media
leak on Seagen’s operations, strategy and employees. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board not to reach out to third parties at such time,
but to revisit this topic as discussions with Company A progressed.
On May 15, 2022, Seagen’s then chairman and chief executive officer resigned as chairman and chief executive officer, with Dr. Baker being appointed as
chairman and Dr. Roger Dansey, who had been previously appointed as interim chief executive officer, remaining in such position.
On the evening of May 15, 2022, Company A received access to due diligence materials (including access to a virtual data room) and commenced due
diligence of detailed information provided by Seagen, including participating in management meetings and due diligence sessions with Seagen.
On May 19, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. The
Centerview representatives reviewed the status of diligence discussions with Company A, as well as preliminary financial perspectives related to the
value of Seagen including possible value attributable to Seagen’s then-ongoing arbitration with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Ltd. (“Daiichi Sankyo”). The
consensus of the Board was that Dr. Baker should approach Company A to proffer an additional due diligence meeting in order to provide Company A
with further information in an effort to increase the transaction price that Company A was willing to pay. The directors next discussed that, following
announcement of the change in Seagen’s chairman and chief executive officer roles, representatives of two global biopharmaceutical companies, which
we refer to as “Company B” and “Company C,” had separately indicated to certain directors their respective interest in discussing a potential strategic
transaction with Seagen. With respect to Company C specifically, Dr. Baker informed the Board that he had received an inbound call from Company C’s
financial advisor to facilitate a call between Dr. Baker and Company C’s chairman and chief executive officer, but that no call was ultimately placed by
Company C’s chairman and chief executive officer. A
 
-36-
Table of Contents
representative of Centerview reviewed information concerning Company B and advised the Board that, given Company B’s size, capital structure and
balance sheet, any consideration in a transaction with Company B would have to be all or mostly stock, as a result of which Seagen stockholders would
hold a majority of the combined company. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Seagen communicate to Company B’s chief executive
officer that Seagen was not interested in discussing a combination with Company B at this time. A representative of Centerview reviewed information
concerning Company C and advised the Board that, given Company C’s capital structure and balance sheet, the consideration in a transaction with
Company C would need to consist at least partly of stock. A Centerview representative also reviewed Company C’s financial position and strategic focus,
commenting on Company C’s ability to complete a transaction with Seagen. After discussion, the consensus of the Board was that Seagen should not
reach out to Company C, but could remain open to a potential incoming proposal from Company C. The directors, in consultation with representatives of
Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS, next discussed the desirability of reaching out to additional potential bidders, with particular focus on Pfizer
and another global biopharmaceutical company which we refer to as “Company D”. The discussion focused on the respective financial capacity of Pfizer
and Company D, the respective strategic benefit of a combination between Seagen and Pfizer or Company D, the capacity of Seagen’s executive
leadership team to manage discussions with one or more additional companies in addition to Company A, the likelihood that either Pfizer or Company D
would be interested in a potential acquisition of Seagen, the likely extent to which a transaction with either Pfizer or Company D would need to include
stock, and the risk of media leaks. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that a representative of Centerview should inquire whether Pfizer
would be prepared to evaluate a potential acquisition of Seagen.
On May 19, 2022, a representative of Centerview spoke to Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive officer, to inquire whether Pfizer would be
prepared to evaluate a potential acquisition of Seagen.
On May 20, 2022, Aamir Malik, Pfizer’s chief business innovation officer, called a representative of Centerview. Mr. Malik noted that Pfizer had been
assessing Seagen for some time and indicated that Pfizer would be interested in exploring a potential acquisition of Seagen and would like to receive a
presentation from Seagen management. Later that day, at the direction of Seagen, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell provided a draft non-disclosure
agreement to Pfizer.
On May 22, 2022, Company A’s outside M&A counsel provided a draft merger agreement to Sullivan & Cromwell for a proposed acquisition of Seagen by
Company A. Company A’s outside M&A counsel also provided a draft voting agreement to Sullivan & Cromwell pursuant to which Baker Bros. and its
affiliates would agree to vote in favor of the potential transaction with Company A. Drafts of these documents continued to be negotiated into July 2022.
Also on May 22, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management. Dr. Baker updated the directors on the status of discussions with
Pfizer and with Company A.
On May 24, 2022, following an exchange of drafts, Pfizer executed a non-disclosure agreement. The non-disclosure agreement had a standstill provision
that by its terms would expire on June 30, 2023, but the non-disclosure agreement provided that Pfizer could make proposals on a confidential basis to the
chairman of Seagen, and that the standstill would terminate if Seagen entered into a definitive agreement providing for an acquisition of 50% or more of
Seagen’s outstanding stock.
On May 25, 2022 Seagen provided a management presentation to Pfizer.
On June 1, 2022, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive officer submitted a written proposal to acquire Seagen at a transaction price in the range of $210 to
$220 per share in cash. Also on June 1, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell,
Centerview and MTS. A Centerview representative updated the directors on discussions with Pfizer, including the due diligence information made
available to Pfizer to date. The directors, in consultation with representatives of Centerview and MTS, discussed their objective of securing a higher
transaction value from Pfizer and the best tactics for doing so. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Centerview should communicate
to Pfizer that its transaction price was not adequate, but that Seagen was willing to provide Pfizer with access to additional
 
-37-

detailed information and make available representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell to discuss legal matters, with a view to receiving early in the week of June
13, 2022 an updated written proposal from Pfizer reflecting a meaningful improvement in the terms of its June 1 proposal, together with a markup of a draft
merger agreement to be provided by Sullivan & Cromwell. Later that day, a representative of Centerview conveyed this to Deborah Baron, Pfizer’s senior
vice president, worldwide business development. During the June 1 Board meeting, a Centerview representative also reviewed with the directors the
status of discussions with Company A, and explained that Company A would likely conclude due diligence during the week of June 13, 2022.
On June 2, 2022, Pfizer received access to due diligence materials (including access to a virtual data room) and commenced due diligence of detailed
information provided by Seagen, including participating in management meetings and due diligence sessions with Seagen.
On June 3, 2022, the chief executive officer of Company D contacted Dr. Baker. Dr. Baker and the chief executive officer of Company D spoke the following
day. During this discussion, the chief executive officer of Company D expressed Company D’s interest in acquiring Seagen. Dr. Baker informed the chief
executive officer of Company D that Seagen was in a position of strength, but could be open to a discussion if Company D would be willing to pay a
substantial biotech premium. The chief executive officer of Company D indicated that he wished to discuss a specific proposal with Dr. Baker after a
meeting of Company D’s board of directors later that week.
On June 5, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell. Representatives of Sullivan &
Cromwell reviewed with the directors the status of merger agreement negotiations with Company A, as well as the merger agreement that representatives
of Sullivan & Cromwell had prepared to send to Pfizer. The directors then provided guidance and direction to Sullivan & Cromwell. Dr. Baker also updated
the directors on his discussion with Company D’s chief executive officer the prior day. The directors discussed whether to broaden discussions to
include other potential parties, whether a broader process may yield a higher transaction price, Seagen’s likely ability under any merger agreement to
receive and accept a higher transaction price from a third party under comparable terms, the risks of overextending management resources by engaging
with too many parties, the impact of any potential media leaks on Seagen and the transaction negotiations, and other considerations. After discussion,
the consensus of the Board was that Pfizer and Company A represented the two global biopharmaceutical companies with the greatest financial
wherewithal to complete a transaction, and the two global biopharmaceutical companies with the greatest probable strategic interest in Seagen.
Later on June 5, 2022, at the direction of Seagen, Sullivan & Cromwell provided a revised draft merger agreement to Company A’s outside M&A counsel.
At the direction of Seagen, Sullivan & Cromwell also provided a draft merger agreement to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”), Pfizer’s
outside legal counsel. The draft merger agreement included a hell-or-high-water regulatory covenant, a 2.0% forward termination fee, a 6.5% regulatory
termination fee, and a six month outside date with a possible extension to a nine month outside date if regulatory approvals remained outstanding.
On June 10, 2022, the chief executive officer of Company D communicated to Dr. Baker that Company D was interested in engaging in due diligence of
Seagen with a view to proposing an acquisition at a price of $200 per share. Dr. Baker replied that he did not consider this proposal to be of sufficient
interest to Seagen and that, under the circumstances, it would not make sense for Seagen to allow Company D to conduct due diligence with a view to
proposing an acquisition at that price. Company D did not revert with a revised proposal following this discussion.
On June 13, 2022, the day that an updated proposal had been requested by Seagen, a representative of Pfizer indicated to a representative of Centerview
that Pfizer would not be submitting an updated proposal.
On June 17, 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that Seagen was in discussions with a global biopharmaceutical company regarding a potential sale of
Seagen. Further reports on this topic were published in
 
-38-
Table of Contents
the Wall Street Journal on June 23, 2022, July 6, 2022 and July 15, 2022. The closing trading price of our common stock on June 17, 2022 was $165.45,
representing an approximately 13% increase from the prior day’s closing. Following the June 17 report, a representative of Pfizer contacted a
representative of Centerview regarding a reference in the report to a large potential marketing alliance that Seagen was purportedly considering. The
Pfizer representative indicated that Pfizer might be interested in engaging in discussions with Seagen concerning such a marketing alliance.
Later on June 17, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. A
representative of Centerview conveyed to the directors the feedback provided by Pfizer on June 13. A representative of Centerview also updated the
directors on the status of discussions with Company A. A representative of Sullivan & Cromwell updated the directors on the status of merger agreement
negotiations with Company A. The directors then discussed the Wall Street Journal article, including the potential impact of the article on Seagen’s
employees and on transaction negotiations. The directors also discussed the benefits, risks and practicalities of reaching out proactively to other
potential bidders, and the consensus of the Board was to continue discussions with Company A.
On June 27, 2022, Dr. Baker and Company A’s chief executive officer discussed the potential transaction. Company A’s chief executive officer indicated
that, due to the uncertainty regarding the significant components of value, it would be difficult for Company A to agree to a transaction price but that the
parties should continue finalizing transaction documentation with an intention of finalizing value at a later date.
On both June 28, 2022 and July 25, 2022, the Board met and discussed the status of the potential transaction with Company A. Members of senior
management attended both meetings, and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS attended the June 28 meeting.
On July 26, 2022, Seagen and Astellas Pharma Inc. announced positive topline results from the phase 1b/2 EV-103 clinical trial (also known as KEYNOTE-
869) Cohort K evaluating PADCEV® in combination with KEYTRUDA® as first-line treatment in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic
urothelial cancer who are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
On August 12, 2022, Seagen announced that the arbitrator in the Daiichi Sankyo arbitration had ruled in favor of Daiichi Sankyo. On the same day, a

would submit a revised proposal the following week.
On August 13, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. The
directors discussed the arbitrator’s decision in the Daiichi Sankyo arbitration, Seagen’s favorable recent Cohort K results, Seagen’s strong 2022 second
quarter earnings, other macro trends, and the status of discussions with Company A.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted into law. The Inflation Reduction Act affects almost all biopharmaceutical companies selling
products in the United States by, among other things, imposing rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize drug price increases that
outpace inflation and requiring the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices with drug companies for certain
drugs.
On August 18, 2022, Company A’s chief executive officer conveyed a reduced transaction price of $195 per share in cash to Dr. Baker. Later that day, Dr.
Baker relayed Company A’s revised transaction price to the Board.
On August 19, 2022, a representative of Centerview spoke to Company A’s head of business development, who indicated that Company A could improve

On August 21, 2022, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. The
directors discussed Company A’s most recent proposal and whether there was a path to reengage with Pfizer to discuss a potential acquisition of Seagen.
After discussion, the consensus of the Board was that Company A’s most recent proposal was not acceptable, that a representative of Centerview should
contact a representative of Pfizer to determine whether there was a path to reengage, and that Seagen should request Company A to “return or destroy”
Seagen’s confidential information and data provided in connection with the potential transaction.
On August 22, 2022, Seagen sent to Company A the “return or destroy” request. Also on August 22, 2022, at Seagen’s direction, a representative of
Centerview contacted a representative of Pfizer to determine whether there was a path to reengage concerning potential acquisition of Seagen.
On August 24, 2022, the representative of Pfizer again confirmed that Pfizer would not be prepared to move forward at that time with an acquisition of
Seagen at a transaction price within the $210 to $220 per share range specified in Pfizer’s June 1 proposal. On August 25, 2022, Seagen sent to Pfizer a
“return or destroy” request.
On August 26, 2022, Bloomberg reported that a global biopharmaceutical company’s discussions to acquire Seagen had stalled.
At a scheduled meeting on September 15 and September 16, 2022, the Board discussed whether to revisit Company A’s August 18 offer. The consensus
of the Board was that Dr. Baker should contact Company A’s chief executive officer to determine whether there was a path to reengage to discuss a
potential transaction.
On September 21, 2022, Dr. Baker contacted Company A’s chief executive officer. Company A’s chief executive officer indicated that Company A was no
longer interested in discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Seagen.
On September 26, 2022, Seagen and a biopharmaceutical company announced an exclusive worldwide license agreement to advance LAVA-1223, a
preclinical gamma delta bispecific T cell engager for epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing solid tumors. Pursuant to this agreement, Seagen also
has an option to nominate up to two additional tumor targets for bispecifics using the biopharmaceutical company’s proprietary GammabodyTM platform.
On November 10, 2022, following a comprehensive search process, Seagen announced that the Board had appointed David R. Epstein as chief executive
officer and a member of the Board. In addition, Seagen announced that Dr. Dansey, Seagen’s interim chief executive officer, had been appointed president,
research and development and chief medical officer.
Also on November 10, 2022, Seagen announced that the FDA had approved ADCTERIS for children with previously untreated high risk Hodgkin
lymphoma, and that data from an ongoing Phase 1 study of SGN-B6A, a wholly-owned ADC, showed early efficacy signals in at least three cancer types,
including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
On December 20, 2022, Seagen announced FDA acceptance of sBLAs for PADCEV with KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced
or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.
On January 9, 2023, Mr. Epstein presented at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, sharing updated data on SGN-B6A, a wholly-owned ADC, showing
a confirmed objective response rate of SGN-B6A at 33% in heavily previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer (median 3.5 lines of
previous therapy), and introduced SGN-B7H4V, a vedotin ADC targeting B7-H4, an immune checkpoint that is upregulated in ovarian, breast and
endometrial cancer. Mr. Epstein also disclosed other recent regulatory and clinical milestones including the FDA

submission in September 2022 of overall survival data to the ADCETRIS label, the completion of enrollment of the PADCEV EV-302 study and expected
data as early as Q4 2023, anticipated data readouts for TIVDAK in the InnovaTV trial and the expectation of the company’s first camptothecin ADC
“INDs” to be filed during 2023. Mr. Epstein also revealed that Seagen was targeting investigational new drug applications for SGN-EGFRd2 (with another
biopharmaceutical company) and CEACAM5 ADC (with another global biopharmaceutical company) for the second half of 2023.
On January 19, 2023, Seagen announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval to TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab for adult patients with
previously treated RASwild-type, HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer.
On January 27, 2023, Dr. Baker received an email from Dr. Bourla seeking to convene a call with Dr. Baker. Drs. Baker and Bourla spoke the following day.
During their discussion, Dr. Bourla conveyed Pfizer was now ready to move forward with pursuing an acquisition of Seagen. Dr. Bourla communicated to
Dr. Baker that Pfizer was prepared to conduct diligence and agreement negotiations and could be in a position to propose a transaction price in the $210
to $220 per share range specified in its June 1, 2022 letter if Pfizer could confirm certain assumptions during its due diligence of Seagen. In this
conversation, Dr. Bourla also conveyed Pfizer’s interest in retaining Seagen personnel and in maintaining Seagen’s presence in the Seattle area.
On February 2, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Dr.
Baker updated the directors on his discussion with Dr. Bourla. Dr. Baker reminded the directors that in June 2022, Sullivan & Cromwell had provided Pfizer
with a draft merger agreement and reviewed certain key terms of that draft merger agreement. Dr. Baker related that following his discussion with Dr.
Bourla, Dr. Baker and Mr. Epstein received preliminary advice from Sullivan & Cromwell concerning a potential acquisition by Pfizer. The directors then
discussed a potential acquisition by Pfizer, including Pfizer’s recent public statements concerning its immediate strategic priorities in the oncology area,
Pfizer’s track record of swiftly executing significant transactions, the need for confidentiality in any discussions with Pfizer in light of the pervasive media
leaks surrounding discussions with Company A in 2022, and the need to minimize distraction of Seagen’s management from Seagen’s operations and
strategy. To contextualize developments in Seagen’s business since Seagen’s discussions with Company A ceased in 2022, Dr. Baker reminded the
directors of elements of the preliminary financial analyses that representatives of Centerview had reviewed with the Board in 2022 in connection with
Seagen’s discussions with Company A. Mr. Epstein then reviewed with the directors certain developments that had occurred in the intervening period.
Dr. Baker and Mr. Epstein commented on various other global biopharmaceutical companies and their likely strategic interest in and financial wherewithal
for entering into discussions to acquire Seagen, and the directors discussed the same. The directors also discussed various regulatory provisions of a
potential merger agreement. After discussion, the consensus of the Board was that Dr. Baker should explore with Dr. Bourla a potential acquisition of
Seagen by Pfizer.
On February 3, 2023, Dr. Baker spoke with Dr. Bourla and arranged for representatives of Pfizer to meet with Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey.
On February 9, 2023, Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey met with representatives of Pfizer to discuss Seagen’s business and prospects, including developments
in Seagen’s business since Pfizer last conducted diligence on Seagen in June 2022. Mr. Epstein described some of the positive developments, including
the data from an ongoing Phase 1 study of SGN-B6A that showed early efficacy signals in at least three cancer types, the fact that the FDA granted
priority review of supplemental biologics license applications for PADCEV with KEYTRUDA® as first-line treatment of certain patients with locally
advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer and encouraging data on the next wave of clinical and pre-clinical assets of Seagen. These included updated
preclinical data on next generation monomethyl auristatin E, and novel linker and payload ADCs.
On February 11, 2023, the Board met, together with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Dr. Baker and Mr. Epstein updated the
directors concerning the recent meeting between Mr. Epstein and
 
-41-
Table of Contents
Dr. Dansey and representatives of Pfizer. Dr. Baker also highlighted certain developments since 2022 that would likely have negative financial
implications, and highlighted a number of developments that would likely have positive financial implications for Seagen. Mr. Epstein then described the
positive revenue opportunities represented by Seagen’s marketed products, expansion opportunities and the quality of Seagen’s extensive product
pipeline, including candidates with blockbuster potential. A discussion among directors ensued, in which the directors commented on and discussed
various strategies and tactics for maximizing the transaction price. The directors also discussed the risks to Seagen arising out of an extensive due
diligence investigation by Pfizer, including the risk of a media leak or leaks similar to those Seagen experienced in 2022, the potential negative impacts of
any such leaks, and the heightened risk to employees, management, and investors of repetitive distraction from Seagen’s operations and strategy. The
directors, in consultation with representatives of Centerview and MTS, then discussed perspectives on valuation in light of both internal and external
developments since 2022. The directors discussed certain non-price transaction terms that they would wish to have substantially agreed prior to granting
Pfizer access to detailed information, including the percentage amount of the regulatory termination fee and the outside date for the transaction. After
discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Dr. Baker should speak to Dr. Bourla and seek the highest transaction price possible but no less than
the upper end of the range to which Dr. Bourla referred, as early an outside date as was achievable, and a large regulatory termination fee.
On February 13, 2023, Dr. Baker spoke with Dr. Bourla and related that Seagen would not provide detailed due diligence information to Pfizer unless and
until certain key transaction terms had been substantially agreed, including transaction pricing. Drs. Baker and Bourla then discussed transaction pricing,
regulatory matters, and human resources matters in connection with a potential acquisition, including retention awards to employees to ensure
employees are retained during the pendency of the transaction and following the closing of the transaction. Dr. Baker also conveyed to Dr. Bourla the
positive financial and operational trends at Seagen.
Later on February 13, 2023, the Board met, together with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Dr. Baker provided the directors
with an update concerning his discussion with Dr. Bourla earlier that day. A discussion among the directors ensued, in which various directors discussed
their views on transaction price, and negotiating tactics for maximizing price. Further discussion among the directors ensued concerning the importance
of a rapid transaction evaluation process, the need to avoid media leaks and the potential negative impacts on Seagen and its operations, strategy and
personnel arising from a lengthy process and/or one or more media leaks. Mr. Epstein provided his views concerning the likely impact on Seagen of the
Inflation Reduction Act as well as positive new data generated on several new medicines. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board that Dr.
Baker should reconvene with Dr. Bourla to seek a transaction price in excess of $225 per share and preferably at or near $230 per share, and that if such a
transaction price were available, Dr. Baker should seek to negotiate the best possible terms with respect to regulatory and human resources matters.
On February 14, 2023, Drs. Baker and Bourla discussed Pfizer’s potential acquisition of Seagen. During these discussions, Dr. Bourla indicated that Pfizer
was prepared to move forward at a transaction price toward the high end of the previously indicated range of $210 to $220 per share, and might consider a
higher transaction price subject to receipt and confirmation of certain items in diligence. Dr. Baker indicated that Pfizer should offer a price at or near $230
per share. Dr. Baker also noted to Dr. Bourla that Seagen would need a transaction structure with a 5.5% regulatory termination fee in the event that the
transaction did not close for regulatory reasons.
On February 15, 2023, Seagen announced financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022 as well as portfolio updates, including
updates with respect to Seagen’s clinical pipeline. Seagen delivered total revenue of nearly $2 billion in 2022, reflecting 25% growth compared to 2021,
which was above consensus expectations. Seagen also provided a 2023 financial outlook and announced multiple key milestones anticipated in 2023,
including potential label expansion, key data readouts and additional international launches for current products. The closing trading price of our
common stock on February 16, 2023, the first trading day following the announcement of financial results, was $160.91, representing an approximately
13.3% increase from the prior trading day’s closing price.

Also on February 15, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and
MTS.
On February 17, 2023, Dr. Baker spoke twice with Dr. Bourla. During the first discussion, Dr. Bourla relayed that he expected to have a meeting later in the
day to review final valuation and would be able to propose a firm transaction price at that time. Drs. Baker and Bourla also discussed Seagen’s year end
results and Dr. Bourla asked Dr. Baker a series of questions concerning certain matters, which Dr. Baker answered. Later on February 17, 2023, Dr. Bourla
conveyed that Pfizer was prepared to move forward with finalizing diligence and documentation for an acquisition of Seagen at a transaction price of
$228.50 per share in cash, targeting an announcement of the transaction on March 13, 2023. After negotiation with Dr. Baker, Dr. Bourla agreed to an
increased transaction price of $229 per share in cash. Drs. Baker and Bourla next discussed regulatory matters, and aligned on a structure with a 5.0%
regulatory termination fee, an 18-month outside date, a covenant whereby Pfizer would not be required to make regulatory divestitures, but would commit
to litigate against a government authority seeking to block the transaction on antitrust grounds, and a covenant whereby Pfizer would forbear from
engaging in transactions that would be reasonably expected to delay completion of the acquisition beyond the outside date. Drs. Baker and Bourla also
aligned on the framework for Seagen retaining and compensating employees to keep the workforce intact. Between February 17 and March 12, 2023, the
detailed terms agreed to by the parties with respect to the retention pool were negotiated and finalized by members of senior management of Seagen and
Pfizer, together with representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton. During the discussion, Dr. Baker agreed that Pfizer could proceed with
diligence.
The Board met twice on February 17, 2023, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and
MTS, with such respective meetings taking place following Dr. Baker’s respective discussions with Dr. Bourla that day.
On February 24, 2023, Pfizer received access to due diligence materials (including access to a virtual data room) and commenced due diligence of detailed
information provided by Seagen, including participating in management meetings and due diligence sessions with Seagen. Between February 24 and
March 12, 2023, representatives of Pfizer engaged in a number of diligence discussions with representatives of Seagen.
Also on February 24, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell a draft of the merger agreement,
revised from the version that Sullivan & Cromwell had initially provided to Wachtell Lipton in June 2022, and a draft voting agreement to be entered into
by Baker Bros. The draft merger agreement reflected the terms discussed by Drs. Baker and Bourla on February 17, 2023, and a 3.9% forward termination
fee. The draft voting agreement was also distributed to Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP (“Akin”), counsel to Baker Bros.
On February 26, 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported that Seagen and Pfizer were discussing a potential acquisition of Seagen by Pfizer. The closing
trading price of our common stock on February 27, 2023, the first trading day following this report, was $178.16, representing an approximately 10%
increase from the prior trading day’s closing.
During the evening of February 26, 2023, following the Wall Street Journal report, Company A’s head of business development contacted a
representative of Centerview seeking additional information about the speculation reflected in the Wall Street Journal report. During the morning of
February 27, 2023, after updating Dr. Baker on this development, the representative of Centerview spoke with Company A’s head of business
development. The Centerview representative indicated that neither Centerview nor Seagen would comment on market rumors. During this discussion,
Company A’s head of business development said that he did not believe Company A’s position had changed from September 2022 that Company A was
not interested in discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Seagen. Thereafter, Company A did not communicate further with Seagen regarding a
potential acquisition of Seagen.
On February 27, 2023, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton discussed open points in the merger agreement, including deal
certainty and deal protection provisions, including the amount of the forward

termination fee. Later that day, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell provided revised drafts of the merger agreement and voting agreement to
representatives of Wachtell Lipton, the latter of which reflected input from Akin. The revised draft merger agreement noted that the amount of the forward
termination fee remained an open point. On February 28, 2023, Centerview provided its written relationships disclosure to Seagen. On March 1, 2023, MTS
provided its written relationships disclosure to Seagen.
On March 2, 2023, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton continued to discuss open points in the merger agreement.
On March 3, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management, Seagen’s internal finance team and representatives of Sullivan &
Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Seagen’s chief financial officer reviewed with the directors Seagen’s financial position and the Seagen Projections. After
discussion, the Seagen Projections were approved by the Board, and the Board instructed Centerview to use the Seagen Projections in connection with
Centerview’s financial analyses. Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell also reviewed with the directors the open points on the merger agreement and
received guidance and direction from the directors. The directors also discussed the Wall Street Journal leak that occurred the prior week, and recognized
the importance of a rapid transaction exploration process given the potential negative impacts on Seagen, its operations and employees of any such
leaks. After Centerview and MTS departed the meeting, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties.
Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell then reviewed with the directors the written relationships disclosures provided to the Board by Centerview and
MTS prior to the meeting; following this review, no director expressed concern regarding the ability of Centerview and MTS to continue to provide
independent financial advice to the Board.
Also on March 3, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell a revised draft of the merger agreement
and a revised draft of the voting agreement.
Between March 5, 2023 and March 12, 2023, representatives of Seagen, Pfizer, Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton had a number of discussions
concerning the open points on the merger agreement.
On March 8, 2023, the Board met, together with representatives of senior management, Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS. Representatives of
Centerview reviewed various preliminary financial analyses based on the Seagen Projections reviewed and approved by the Board on March 3.
Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell reviewed the open points on the merger agreement and received guidance and direction from the directors.
On March 10, 2023, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton exchanged drafts of the merger agreement, and representatives of Akin
provided a revised draft of the voting agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton.
On March 11, 2023, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided a revised draft of the voting agreement to representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and
Akin, the form of which was acceptable to all parties thereto.
Also on March 11, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview and MTS.
During the meeting, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell also reviewed the remaining open points in the merger agreement and received guidance and
direction.
Throughout March 11, 2023 and into the morning of March 12, 2023, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton exchanged drafts of the
merger agreement and participated in various calls to discuss the open points on the merger agreement. On certain of these calls, representatives of
Sullivan & Cromwell and Wachtell Lipton were joined by representatives of Seagen and Pfizer. The parties ultimately aligned on a forward termination fee
of $1,646 million (or approximately 3.7% of equity transaction value).
On the morning of March 12, 2023, the Board met, together with members of senior management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, Centerview
and MTS. Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell

reviewed with the directors the proposed resolution of the open points of the merger agreement. Representatives of Centerview then reviewed with the
Board Centerview’s financial analysis of the merger consideration, and rendered to the Board Centerview’s oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 12, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the
merger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Centerview’s opinion, please see below under the caption “ —Opinion of
Seagen’s Financial Advisor.” After careful consideration, the Board, by resolutions unanimously adopted by the Board then: (i) determined that the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Seagen and its stockholders; (ii) approved
and declared it advisable to enter into the merger agreement and the voting agreement; (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be
submitted to a vote of the Seagen stockholders at the special meeting; and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, resolved to
make the company board recommendation. The merger agreement and voting agreement were executed later that day.
On the morning of March 13, 2023, prior to the opening of trading on Nasdaq, Seagen and Pfizer issued a joint press release announcing the execution of
the merger agreement.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors; Reasons for the Merger
After careful consideration, at a meeting held on March 12, 2023, the Board, by resolutions unanimously adopted by the Board: (i) determined that the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Seagen and Seagen stockholders; (ii)
approved and declared it advisable to enter into the merger agreement and the voting agreement; (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement
be submitted to a vote of Seagen stockholders at the special meeting; and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, resolved to
make the company board recommendation.
Our stockholders must approve the merger agreement proposal in order for the merger to occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A
to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully and in its entirety.
The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement proposal. Accordingly, a stockholder may
vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and vote not to approve the compensation proposal, and vice versa. Because the vote on the
compensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Seagen, Pfizer or Merger Sub. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted
by our stockholders in accordance with the requisite company vote and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to
Seagen’s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their respective compensation agreements and arrangements
even if the stockholders do not approve the compensation proposal.
The Board unanimously recommends that the Seagen stockholders vote “FOR” the above proposals.
In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, the Board consulted with the senior management of
Seagen, its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following non-exhaustive list of material
reasons (which are not listed in order of relative importance) that the Board believes support its unanimous determination and recommendation:
 
•
the likelihood of realizing a compelling, immediate and certain value of $229.00 per share in cash pursuant to the merger as compared to the
uncertain prospect that the market price of our common stock would reach $229.00 in the foreseeable future, if ever, due to clinical,
regulatory, commercialization and other business risks, including the risk that one or more of disitamab vedotin, ladiratuzumab vedotin,
SGN-B6A and Seagen’s other product candidates do not obtain regulatory approval or market acceptance;
 
-45-
Table of Contents
•
recent and historical market prices for our common stock, as compared to the merger consideration, including the fact that the merger
consideration of $229.00 per share represents an approximate premium of:
 
•
42% to the $161.37 closing price per share of our common stock on February 24, 2023, the last trading day prior to the first media
accounts speculating about a possible acquisition of Seagen by Pfizer;
 
•
54% to the $148.42 price per share of our common stock based on the volume weighted average price per share of common stock for
the 30-trading day period ended February 24, 2023; and
 
•
33% to the $172.61 closing price per share of our common stock on March 10, 2023, the last trading day before public announcement
of the merger agreement;
 
•
the oral opinion of Centerview rendered to the Board on March 12, 2023, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion
dated such date that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration
to be paid to the holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Centerview’s opinion, please see below in “—Opinion of Centerview
Partners LLC.” The written opinion delivered by Centerview is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C;
 
•
the course and history of the negotiations between Seagen and Pfizer, including the Board’s belief that these negotiations yielded Pfizer’s
best offer, and the enhancements to the merger agreement that Seagen was able to obtain as a result of these negotiations, as described
under “—Background of the Merger”;
 
•
the fact that Seagen had held robust, extensive discussions with Company A in 2020 and 2022 and that such discussions did not yield a firm
offer equivalent or superior to the merger consideration;
 
•
the Board’s belief, following discussion with senior management and representatives of Seagen’s financial advisors, and after considering
Seagen’s prior discussions with Company A and preliminary discussions with Company D, that it was unlikely that any other potential
acquirors, including financial sponsors and strategic buyers, would be willing and able to acquire Seagen at a price in excess of $229.00 per
share in cash, even if Seagen were to conduct an auction process or other solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals;
 
•
the fact that there were media reports that Pfizer was in talks to acquire Seagen, and, in 2022, there were extensive media reports that another
global biopharmaceutical company was in talks to acquire Seagen, which provided any third party wishing to engage in discussions with
Seagen multiple opportunities to make its interest known;
 
•
the fact that, although the Board had not granted Pfizer exclusivity and was free to consider indications of interest from any other party, no
potential acquiror other than Pfizer made a proposal to acquire Seagen during the period between the initial media reports of Pfizer’s interest
on February 26, 2023 and the public announcement of the merger agreement on March 13, 2023, and the Board’s view that, if potential
acquirors were interested in exploring a transaction with Seagen, such potential acquirors could have engaged with the Board or its
representatives before such public announcement;
 
•
the anticipated timing of the consummation of merger, including the likelihood of consummation, based upon the scope of the conditions to
the consummation of the merger including the definition of “material adverse effect,” the terms of the voting agreement, the relative
likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, the remedies available to Seagen under the merger agreement in the event of various
breaches by Pfizer, including specific performance, and Pfizer’s business reputation in the biopharmaceutical industry, its financial capacity
to complete an acquisition of this size and its track record of successfully completing acquisitions of other businesses;
 
-46-
Table of Contents
•
the fact that Pfizer agreed to pay to Seagen a reverse termination fee of $2,224 million if the merger is not consummated by reason of failure
to obtain approval under antitrust or foreign direct investment laws under the circumstances described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fees”;
 
•
the Board’s belief that the termination fee and other limitations applicable to, among other things, an adverse recommendation change and
acquisition proposals agreed to in the merger agreement (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation;
Adverse Recommendation Changes”) were reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential
acquirer from submitting an unsolicited proposal to acquire Seagen following the announcement of the merger agreement or prohibit the
Board or its representatives from engaging with any such potential acquiror in such a circumstance, subject to the applicable provisions of
the merger agreement;
 
•
the Board’s review of the structure of the merger and the financial and other terms of the merger agreement, including, among others, the
following terms of the merger agreement:
 
•
the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which the Board believed are reasonable and customary in number and
scope;
 
•
representations from Pfizer and Merger Sub that they will have all funds necessary to pay the amounts required to be paid by them,
pursuant to the merger agreement, and the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement; and
 
•
the customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Seagen in the merger agreement; and
 
•
the state of the U.S. and global economies, increased market volatility, U.S. and global inflation trends and the increasing interest rate
environment to combat inflation, the potential for a recession, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory changes
including the Inflation Reduction Act, and the current and potential impact in both the near term and long term on the biopharmaceutical
industry and Seagen of these trends and developments.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board, in consultation with senior management of Seagen, its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, also
considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the merger agreement and the merger, including the following factors (which
are not listed in order of relative importance):
 
•
the fact that Seagen will no longer exist as a standalone public company and Seagen’s stockholders will forgo participation in any future
increase in Seagen’s value that might result from our earnings or possible growth as a standalone public company, including if each of
disitamab vedotin, ladiratuzumab vedotin, SGN-B6A and Seagen’s other pipeline product candidates prove successful in clinical trials and
obtain regulatory approval and market acceptance;
 
•
the covenants in the merger agreement that preclude Seagen from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals (although Seagen is able to
provide information in response to unsolicited acquisition proposals, as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation; Adverse Recommendation Changes”) and provide Pfizer with customary “matching” rights prior to Seagen terminating the
merger agreement to accept a superior proposal;
 
•
the possibility that the voting agreement may serve to deter potentially interested parties from submitting an alternative acquisition
proposal;
 
•
the fact that Seagen would be obligated to pay the termination fee of $1,646 million in cash under certain circumstances, including the
potential impact of such termination fee on the willingness of other potential acquirors to propose alternative transactions, although the
Board believed that the termination fee was reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable
 
-47-
Table of Contents
potential acquiror from submitting a proposal to acquire Seagen following the announcement of the merger agreement;
 
•
the effect of the public announcement of the merger agreement on Seagen’s operations and employees, as well as Seagen’s ability to attract
and retain key personnel while the merger is pending;
 
•
the fact that Pfizer’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the merger are subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, and
the possibility that such conditions may not be satisfied on a timely basis or at all, including as a result of events outside of Seagen’s
control, and the fact that, if the merger is not consummated:
 
•
Seagen’s directors, officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have experienced significant
distractions from their work during the pendency of the merger, and Seagen will have incurred significant transaction costs attempting
to consummate the merger;
 
•
the market’s perception of Seagen’s continuing business could potentially result in a loss of customers, suppliers, distributors,
business partners, collaboration partners and employees; and
 
•
the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected;
 
•
the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Seagen must refrain from a number of actions related to the conduct of its business
without first obtaining Pfizer’s written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the possibility these terms
may limit the ability of Seagen to pursue business opportunities that it would otherwise pursue, including potential acquisitions,
investments, licenses and other strategic opportunities;
 
•
the fact that certain of Seagen’s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from, and in addition to, those
of Seagen’s other stockholders, as described in the section entitled “—Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger”;
 
•
the fact that Seagen has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the proposed
transaction, regardless of whether the merger is consummated;
 
•
the potential for litigation by stockholders in connection with the merger, which, even where lacking in merit, could nonetheless result in
distraction and expense; and
 
•
the fact that receipt of the merger consideration generally would be taxable to Seagen’s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
The foregoing discussion of the information and reasons considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material reasons
considered by the Board. In view of the variety of reasons considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement, the Board did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons considered in reaching its determination and
recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different reasons. The Board did not undertake to make any
specific determination as to whether any reason, or any particular aspect of any reason, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The
Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented. After considering these reasons, the Board concluded that the positive
reasons related to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, substantially outweighed the potential negative
reasons.
Portions of this explanation of the reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore,
should be read in light of the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”",41,55

made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the

from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion, dated March 12, 2023, which describes the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy

contemplated by the merger agreement and Centerview’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date thereof, to the

by the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to any Seagen stockholder or any other person as to how such stockholder or other
person should vote with respect to the merger or otherwise act with respect to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement or any other matter. 
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the various assumptions made, procedures

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Centerview reviewed, among other things:
 
•
a draft of the merger agreement, dated March 12, 2023, referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the “draft merger agreement”;

certain interim reports to Seagen stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Seagen;
 
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Seagen;

certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of Seagen, including
certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to Seagen prepared by management of Seagen and furnished to Centerview by
Seagen for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, which are referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the “forecasts”, and are
described further below in the section entitled “Certain Unaudited Financial Information” beginning on page 55 of this proxy statement, and
which are collectively referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the “internal data.”
Centerview also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of Seagen regarding their assessment of the
internal data. In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for Seagen and compared
that data with similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that Centerview deemed relevant.
Centerview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other
transactions that Centerview deemed relevant, and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as
Centerview deemed appropriate.

Centerview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal, regulatory,
tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by Centerview for purposes of its opinion and, with Seagen’s consent,
Centerview relied upon such information as being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview assumed, at Seagen’s direction, that the internal data
(including, without limitation, the forecasts) were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Seagen as to the matters covered thereby and Centerview relied, at Seagen’s direction, on the internal data for purposes of Centerview’s
analysis and opinion. Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the internal data or the assumptions on which it was based. In addition, at Seagen’s
direction, Centerview did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or
otherwise) of Seagen, nor was Centerview furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and Centerview was not asked to conduct, and did not
conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of Seagen. Centerview assumed, at Seagen’s direction, that the final executed merger agreement
would not differ in any respect material to Centerview’s analysis or opinion from the draft merger agreement reviewed by Centerview. Centerview also
assumed, at Seagen’s direction, that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with all applicable
laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the
effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,
regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, no
delay, limitation, restriction, condition or other change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s
opinion. Centerview did not evaluate and did not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of Seagen, the ability of Seagen to pay its
obligations when they come due, or as to the impact of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on such matters,

and Centerview expressed no opinion as to any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
Centerview’s opinion expressed no view as to, and did not address, Seagen’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or the relative merits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to Seagen or in which Seagen might engage.
Centerview’s opinion was limited to and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of Centerview’s written opinion, to the
holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) of the merger consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger
agreement. For purposes of its opinion, Centerview was not asked to, and Centerview did not, express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any
other term or aspect of the merger agreement, merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including, without limitation, the
structure or form of the merger or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into in connection with or
otherwise contemplated by the merger, including, without limitation, the fairness of the merger or any other term or aspect of the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, or the impact of the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Seagen
or any other party. In addition, Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other

connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, whether relative to the merger consideration to be paid to
the holders of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Centerview’s opinion was necessarily based on financial,

other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any other matter. Centerview’s financial advisory services and its written opinion were
provided for the information and assistance of the Board (in the directors’ capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for

Summary of Centerview Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Board in connection with Centerview’s opinion, dated
March 12, 2023. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by,
and underlying the opinion of, Centerview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to
those financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so the
reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized below should not be taken to be Centerview’s view of the actual
value of Seagen. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the tables below without considering all financial analyses or
factors or the full narrative description of such analyses or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview’s financial analyses and its opinion. In performing its analyses,
Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Seagen or any other parties to the merger. None of Seagen, Pfizer, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition,
analyses relating to the value of Seagen do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which Seagen may actually be sold. Accordingly, the
assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before
March 10, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger) and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Selected Public Company Analysis
Centerview reviewed and analyzed certain financial information of Seagen and compared it to corresponding financial information of certain publicly-
traded, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies (which companies are referred to as the “selected companies” in this summary of Centerview’s
opinion) that Centerview, based on its experience and professional judgment, deemed relevant to consider in relation to Seagen. Although none of the
selected companies is identical or directly comparable to Seagen, the selected companies were selected by Centerview because, among other reasons,
they are publicly-traded, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies with certain business, operational and/or financial characteristics that, for
purposes of Centerview’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of Seagen.
However, because none of the selected companies is exactly the same as Seagen, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not,
rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its
experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the business, operational and/or financial characteristics and other factors that
could affect the public trading values of the selected companies and Seagen in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the
quantitative analysis.

Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of March 10, 2023, Centerview calculated, for each selected
company, such company’s enterprise value (calculated as the equity value (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account
outstanding in-the-money options, warrants, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities) plus the book value of debt
and certain liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated revenue for calendar year 2026
(“EV/2026E Revenue Multiple”).

Based on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and experience, related to, among other
things, differences in the business, operational and/or financial conditions and prospects of Seagen and the companies included in the selected public
company analysis, Centerview selected a reference range of EV/2026E Revenue Multiples of 4.5x to 5.5x. Centerview applied this reference range of
EV/2026E Revenue Multiples to Seagen’s estimated calendar year risk-adjusted 2026 revenue of $4.371 billion as set forth in the forecasts and added to it
Seagen’s estimated net cash, as of June 30, 2023, of $1.334 billion, provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the internal data, and divided the
results of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of our common stock (determined using the treasury stock method
and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options, long-term incentive plans, restricted stock units, and performance stock units (including
assumptions regarding the vesting of such performance stock units)) based on information provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the
internal data. This analysis resulted in an implied per share equity value range for shares of our common stock of approximately $109.15 to $131.70,
rounded to the nearest $0.05. Centerview then compared this range to the merger consideration of $229.00 per share of our common stock to be paid to
the holders of shares of our common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement.
Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis
Centerview reviewed and analyzed certain financial information of Seagen and compared it to corresponding financial information of certain transactions
listed below involving commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies (which transactions are referred to as the “selected transactions” in this summary
of Centerview’s opinion) that Centerview, based on its experience and professional judgment, deemed relevant to consider in relation to Seagen and the
merger. Although none of the selected transactions is identical or directly comparable to the merger, the companies included in the selected transactions
were selected by Centerview because, among other reasons, they are commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies with certain business, operational
and/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, may be considered similar to the merger.
However, because none of the selected transactions is exactly the same as the merger, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did
not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected precedent transactions analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments,
based on its experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the business, operational and/or financial characteristics and other
factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the target companies in the selected transactions and Seagen in order to provide
a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.

Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of the time of the announcement of the selected transactions,
Centerview calculated, for each selected transaction, the transaction value (calculated as the offer value (determined using the treasury stock method and
taking into account outstanding in-the-money options, warrants, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities), plus
the book value of debt and certain liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and excluding any contingent consideration) implied for each target company
based on the consideration payable in the applicable selected transaction) as a multiple of the target company’s Wall Street research analyst consensus
estimated three-year forward revenue at the time of the transaction announcement (“Three-Year Forward Revenue Multiple”).

Based on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its experience and professional judgment, related to, among other
things, differences in the business, operational and/or financial conditions and prospects of Seagen and the companies included in the selected
transactions analysis, Centerview selected a reference range of Three-Year Forward Revenue Multiples of 5.0x to 9.5x derived from the selected
transactions. Centerview applied this reference range of Three-Year Forward Revenue Multiples to Seagen’s estimated three-year forward revenue based
on the internal data of $4.016 billion, added to it Seagen’s estimated net cash as of June 30, 2023 of $1.334 billion, and divided the result of the foregoing
calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of our common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account
outstanding in-the-money options, long-term incentive plans, restricted stock units, and performance stock units (including assumptions regarding the
vesting of such performance stock units)) based on information provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the internal data. This analysis
resulted in an implied per share equity value range for shares of our common stock of approximately $111.15 to $203.65, rounded to the nearest $0.05.
Centerview then compared this range to the merger consideration of $229.00 per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of our
common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Seagen based on the forecasts. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation
methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or set of assets by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of the asset or set
of assets. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts
by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other
appropriate factors.
 
-53-
Table of Contents
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of equity values for shares of our common stock by (a) discounting to present value, as of
June 30, 2023, using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 9.5% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of Seagen’s weighted average cost of capital) and using a
mid-year convention: (i) the forecasted risk-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows of Seagen over the period beginning on July 1, 2023 and ending
on December 31, 2034, utilized by Centerview based on the forecasts, (ii) a range of implied terminal values of Seagen, calculated by Centerview using a
reference range of price-to-earnings multiples of 16x to 20x (which range was selected by Centerview using its experience and professional judgment) and
applying this reference range of price-to-earnings multiples to Seagen’s estimated calendar year risk-adjusted 2034 net income, based on information
provided by the management of Seagen, as of March 10, 2023, and set forth in the internal data and (iii) tax savings from usage of Seagen’s federal net
operating losses of $682 million, as of December 31, 2022, and Seagen’s future losses and (b) adding to the foregoing results Seagen’s estimated net cash,
as of June 30, 2023, of $1.334 billion, which amount was provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the internal data. Centerview divided the
result of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of our common stock (determined using the treasury stock method
and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options, long-term incentive plans, restricted stock units, and performance stock units (including
assumptions regarding the vesting of such performance stock units)), based on information provided by the management of Seagen as set forth in the
internal data. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of our common stock of $179.40 to $231.80, rounded to the nearest $0.05.
Centerview then compared this range to the merger consideration of $229.00 per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of our
common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement.
Other Factors
Centerview noted for the Board certain additional factors solely for reference and informational purposes only, including, among other things, the
following:
 
•
Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of shares of our common stock during the
52-week period ended March 10, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger), which reflected low and high
stock closing prices for Seagen during such period of $108.81 to $181.29 per share of our common stock, and the closing trading price of
shares of our common stock on February 24, 2023 (the last trading day prior to the date on which the trading price of our common stock was
perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential transaction) of $161.37 per share of our common stock.
 
•
Analyst Price Targets Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for shares of our common stock in publicly available Wall Street
research analyst reports as of March 10, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger) which indicated low and
high stock price targets for Seagen ranging from $141.00 to $215.00 per share of our common stock.
 
•
Precedent Premiums Paid Analysis. Centerview performed an analysis of premiums paid in the selected transactions involving publicly-
traded, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies, as set forth above in “Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis.” The premiums in
this analysis were calculated by comparing the per share acquisition price in each transaction to the closing price of the target company’s
common stock for the date one day prior to the date on which the trading price of the target’s common stock was perceived by Centerview
to be affected by a potential transaction. Based on the analysis above and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its
professional judgment, Centerview applied a range of 40% to 60% to Seagen’s closing stock price on February 24, 2023 (the last trading day
prior to the date on which the trading price of our common stock was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential transaction) of
$161.37, which resulted in an implied price range of approximately $225.90 to $258.20 per share of our common stock, rounded to the nearest
$0.05.

General
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it
considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results
of all of the analyses.
Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in its evaluation of the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
views of the Board or management of Seagen with respect to the merger consideration or as to whether the Board would have been willing to determine
that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement was determined
through arm’s-length negotiations between Seagen and Pfizer and was approved by the Board. Centerview provided advice to Seagen during these
negotiations. Centerview did not, however recommend any specific amount of consideration to Seagen or the Board or that any specific amount of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and
merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, except for Centerview’s current engagement, Centerview had not
been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Seagen, and did not receive any compensation from Seagen during such period. In the
two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview had been engaged to provide and was providing, as of the date of its written opinion,
financial advisory services unrelated to Seagen to Pfizer, for which Centerview has received compensation and for which Centerview expects to receive
additional compensation, including in connection with Pfizer’s acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2022 and certain other strategic matters.
Centerview has received between $30 million and $40 million in aggregate compensation from Pfizer for work performed during such period, including
expected fees for work currently being performed. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to Seagen or Pfizer or
their respective affiliates in the future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview’s and its affiliates’ directors, officers,
members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview’s affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other
persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt,
equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, Seagen, Pfizer, or any of
their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the merger based on Centerview’s reputation, experience and knowledge of the
biopharmaceutical industry. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to
the merger.
In connection with Centerview’s services as the financial advisor to the Board, Seagen has agreed to pay Centerview an aggregate fee of approximately
$88 million, $8.5 million of which was payable upon execution of the merger agreement and will be paid on December 1, 2023, and the remainder of which is
payable contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, Seagen has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview’s expenses arising, and to
indemnify Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise out of Centerview’s engagement.

Seagen’s management does not as a matter of course make public long-range projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other results
due to, among other reasons, uncertainty, unpredictability and
 
-55-Table of Contents
subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. Seagen is especially reluctant to disclose projections for extended periods due to the
increasing uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of such assumptions and estimates when applied to time periods further in the future. As a
result, Seagen does not endorse projections or other unaudited prospective financial information as a reliable indication of future results. However, in
connection with the Board’s evaluation of the merger, Seagen’s management independently prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information
for fiscal years 2023 through 2034, which we refer to generally as the “Seagen Projections.” The Seagen Projections were made available to the Board in
connection with their consideration and evaluation of the merger and were provided to Centerview in connection with the rendering of Centerview’s
fairness opinion to the Board and in performing its related financial analyses, as described above in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—
Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC” beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement. Additionally, a portion of the Seagen Projections reflecting estimated
net revenue for fiscal year 2023 and operating expenses for fiscal years 2023 through 2025 were provided to Pfizer in connection with its evaluation of
Seagen.
Seagen is including a summary of the Seagen Projections in this proxy statement in order to provide Seagen stockholders with access to the projections
that were made available to, and approved by, the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and made available to Centerview, and which
Centerview was instructed by the Board to use, in connection with its financial analyses and opinion.

Non-GAAP financial measure. At the direction of Seagen’s management, Centerview calculated, from the Seagen Projections (which were approved for use by the Board)
and based on information and assumptions provided by Seagen’s management and as set forth in the Seagen Projections, “Unlevered Free Cash Flow,” which was reviewed
and approved by Seagen’s management and the Board for use by Centerview in connection with its financial analyses and opinion. “Unlevered Free Cash Flow” means
EBIT less tax expenses (if profitable and excluding the impact of NOL usage), plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, and plus/less changes in net
working capital. Stock-based compensation expense is treated as a cash expense.
Additional Information About the Seagen Projections",62,63
Seagen Inc._20230424_DEFM14A_20812583_4650531.Pdf,Additional Information About the Seagen Projections,"Additional Information About the Seagen Projections
The inclusion of the Seagen Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that Seagen or any of its affiliates, advisors or
representatives (including Centerview) have considered the Seagen Projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the Seagen Projections
should not be relied upon as such. This summary of the Seagen Projections is not being included in this proxy statement to influence your decision
whether to vote in favor of any proposal. Seagen advises the recipients of the Seagen Projections that its internal financial forecasts upon which the
Seagen Projections were based are subjective in many respects.
Although presented with numerical specificity, the Seagen Projections were based on numerous variables, assumptions and estimates as to future events
made by Seagen’s management that Seagen’s management believed were reasonable at the time the Seagen Projections were prepared, taking into
account the relevant information available to management at the time. These variables, assumptions and estimates are inherently
 
-56-Table of Contents
uncertain and many are beyond the control of Seagen. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Seagen Projections to not be
achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the business of Seagen (including its ability to achieve strategic goals,
objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, the probability of technical and regulatory success, the regulatory and competitive
environment, changes in technology, general business and economic conditions and other risk factors referenced in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Various assumptions underlying the Seagen Projections may not prove to have
been, or may no longer be, accurate. The Seagen Projections may not be realized, and actual results may be significantly higher or lower than projected in
the Seagen Projections. The Seagen Projections summarized above do not account for the effects of the merger. The Seagen Projections also reflect
assumptions as to certain business strategies or plans that are subject to change. The Seagen Projections do not take into account any circumstances or
events occurring after the date they were prepared. The Seagen Projections cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less
predictive with each successive year. As a result, the inclusion of the Seagen Projections in this proxy statement should not be relied on as necessarily
predictive of actual future events, and actual results may differ materially (and will differ materially if the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement are completed) from the Seagen Projections. For all of these reasons, the internal financial Seagen Projections, and the
assumptions upon which they are based, are (i) not guarantees of future results; (ii) inherently speculative; and (iii) subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the Seagen Projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
the Seagen Projections will be realized.
The Seagen Projections were prepared solely for internal use and to assist the Board with its consideration and evaluation of the merger, and Centerview
with its financial analyses and opinion, and although they were prepared on an accounting basis consistent with Seagen’s financial statements, they were
not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The Seagen Projections
included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Seagen. Neither Seagen’s independent auditor nor any other
independent accountant has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Seagen Projections, nor have they expressed any
opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.
The EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow figures contained in the Seagen Projections are “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial
performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The non-GAAP financial measures
used in the Seagen Projections were relied upon by Centerview at the instruction of the Board for purposes of its opinion and by the Board in connection
with their evaluation of the merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial
measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the merger if the
disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by
Centerview for purposes of its opinion or by the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger. Accordingly, Seagen has not provided a
reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Seagen Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial
measures as used by Seagen may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in
non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these
non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
For these reasons, as well as the basis and assumptions on which the Seagen Projections were compiled, the inclusion of specific portions of the Seagen
Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that such Seagen Projections will be an accurate prediction of future events,
and they should not be
 
-57-
Table of Contents
relied on as such. None of Seagen or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including Centerview) can give you any
assurance that actual results will not differ from these Seagen Projections. Except as required by applicable law, none of Seagen or any of its affiliates,
advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including Centerview) undertake any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the
Seagen Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Seagen Projections were generated or to reflect
the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error. Therefore, readers of the this proxy
statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the portions of the Seagen Projections set forth above. None of Seagen or any of its
affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including Centerview) intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to
these Seagen Projections. In addition, none of Seagen or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives (including
Centerview) have made, make, or are authorized in the future to make, any representation to any stockholder or other person regarding Seagen’s ultimate
performance compared to the information contained in the Seagen Projections or that projected results will be achieved, and any statements to the
contrary should be disregarded.

In considering the recommendation of the Board that Seagen stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement, Seagen stockholders should
be aware that the executive officers and directors of Seagen have certain interests in the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Seagen stockholders generally. The Board was aware
of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and in making their recommendation that Seagen
stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement.
For purposes of this disclosure, we have included the named executive officers of Seagen for Seagen’s most recent proxy statement, which was for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as well as the executive officers who we expect to be our named executive officers for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 (which we refer to together as the “NEOs”):
 
•
David R. Epstein, Chief Executive Officer
 
•
Roger D. Dansey, M.D., President, Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer
 
•
Todd E. Simpson, Chief Financial Officer
 
•
Chip R. Romp, Executive Vice President, Commercial U.S.
 
•
Jean I. Liu, Chief Legal Officer
 
•
Vaughn B. Himes, Ph.D., Chief Technical Officer
 
•
Clay B. Siegall, Ph.D., Former President and Chief Executive Officer
The NEOs include each of Seagen’s current executive officers.
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will constitute a “change in control” under the employment agreements
that Seagen’s executive officers are party to and the compensation arrangements in which they participate. The treatment of Seagen equity awards and
certain other compensation arrangements in connection with the merger is provided in the merger agreement and is detailed below.
Treatment of Seagen Equity Awards
Seagen Options
At the effective time, each Seagen Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share
exercise price of such Seagen
 
-58-Table of Contents
Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen Option (which number, in the case of Seagen Options
subject to performance goals based on stock price hurdles, will be determined based on actual performance in accordance with the terms of such Seagen
Options, with any Seagen Options that do not vest being forfeited for no consideration), net of applicable taxes and without interest.
Restricted Stock Units
At the effective time, each Seagen RSU, other than any post-signing Seagen RSU, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time,
whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger
consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen RSU, net of applicable taxes and without interest.
Each post-signing Seagen RSU will be substituted automatically with a Pfizer cash award with respect to an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
merger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such post-signing Seagen RSU. Each Pfizer cash award
will otherwise be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to such post-signing Seagen RSU as of immediately prior to the
effective time. For Seagen RSUs granted in connection with Seagen’s annual grants in August 2023, one-third of the outstanding amount of such awards
will vest immediately prior to the effective time, and the remaining portion of the award will vest in equal installments on the first two annual anniversaries
of closing, or upon an earlier termination without “cause” (as defined in Seagen’s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), due to death,
disability, or for good reason.
Annual Performance-based Share Units
At the effective time, each Seagen non-products PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then vested, will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen non-products PSU based on (a) for performance periods that are complete as of the effective
time, actual performance, and (b) for performance periods that are incomplete as of the effective time, the greater of the target and actual performance, net
of applicable taxes and without interest.
Products Performance-based Share Units
At the effective time, each Seagen products PSU that is unearned and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be substituted with a Pfizer
performance cash award with respect to that number of shares of Pfizer common stock that is equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen products PSU. Each Pfizer performance cash award will
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such Seagen products PSU as of immediately prior to the effective time; provided,
that upon a termination without “cause” (as defined in Seagen’s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), due to death or disability, or for
good reason, the service conditions that such Pfizer performance cash award is subject to will be waived, and the award will vest in full upon the
achievement of performance conditions (and will be forfeited if such performance conditions are not achieved).
For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Seagen’s NEOs (which includes each of Seagen’s current executive officers) on
settlement of their unvested Seagen equity awards, see the section entitled “—Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement. The estimated aggregate amount that would be realized by the eight
non-employee directors of Seagen in respect of their unvested Seagen equity awards as of April 7, 2023, on a “single-trigger” basis, is $5,462,587.

Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers
Each NEO has an employment agreement with Seagen providing for severance payments and termination benefits upon a termination by Seagen without
“cause” or due to a “constructive termination.” The merger will constitute a “change in control” for purposes of the NEOs’ employment agreements. In
the event of a termination of employment by Seagen without “cause” or due to a “constructive termination” in the three months prior to, or 18 months
following, a change in control of Seagen, the NEOs (other than Dr. Siegall, whose separation agreement is described below) will be entitled to receive
payment of severance benefits equal to, for Mr. Epstein, his annual base salary for 36 months and 3 times his target bonus, for Dr. Dansey, his annual
base salary for 24 months and 2 times his target bonus, and for Mr. Simpson, Mr. Romp, Ms. Liu and Mr. Himes, his or her annual base salary for 18
months and 1.5 times his or her target bonus. In addition, each NEO will be entitled to receive (i) payment of 18 months of COBRA premiums, and (ii)
double-trigger acceleration of equity awards (unless otherwise provided in an equity award agreement). For Mr. Epstein, any clawback provisions
applicable to the relocation payment provided to him in connection with his employment will not apply if he is terminated without “cause” or due to a
“constructive termination” in the three months prior to or 18 months following a change in control of Seagen. Such severance benefits (other than with
respect to the lapse of the clawback applicable to Mr. Epstein’s relocation payment) are conditioned upon such executive’s resignation from all positions
held by such executive and execution of a full release and waiver of claims.
For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Seagen’s NEOs under their employment agreements
upon a qualifying termination, see the section entitled “ —Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement.
Separation Agreement with Dr. Siegall
On May 15, 2022, Seagen entered into a letter agreement with Dr. Siegall (the “Siegall separation agreement”), pursuant to which Seagen and Dr. Siegall
mutually agreed that Dr. Siegall would resign as our president, chief executive officer and as a member of the Board effective May 15, 2022. The Siegall
separation agreement provides that, due to the unique positions held by Dr. Siegall and Dr. Siegall’s agreement to certain terms and conditions not
provided for in his employment agreement, including the extension of the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, in the event that a change in
control occurs on or prior to December 31, 2023, notwithstanding his earlier termination, Dr. Siegall would receive the remaining severance, equity vesting,
and healthcare benefits that he would have been entitled to under the Siegall employment agreement had he been terminated in connection with such
change in control. If the closing of the merger (the “closing”) occurs on or prior to December 31, 2023, Dr. Siegall will be entitled to receive: (i) payment of
severance benefits equal to his (a) annual base salary for 18 months, (b) 1.5 times his target bonus and (c) his target annual bonus for 2022 multiplied by
0.37; (ii) payment of COBRA premiums until May 15, 2025, and (iii) the portion of his equity awards that did not become vested in connection with his
separation will become fully vested and, in the case of stock options, exercisable. In the event the closing occurs after December 31, 2023, Dr. Siegall will
not be entitled to such payments and benefits.
For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would be payable to Dr. Siegall under the Siegall separation agreement, see the section
entitled “—Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 62 of this proxy
statement.
Section 280G Letter Agreements
Because Mr. Epstein was recently hired as Seagen’s chief executive officer in November 2022, and Dr. Dansey was the interim chief executive officer in
2022 and transitioned into the role of president, research & development and chief medical officer in 2022, in connection with these appointments, both
Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey received substantial performance-based equity compensation awards in 2022 in order to facilitate an alignment of interests
between the executive and Seagen stockholders. Notwithstanding the strong positive
 
-60-
Table of Contents
alignment these performance awards have with stockholders, these performance awards have much worse treatment under Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), than time vested awards.
In light of these considerations, on March 12, 2023, Seagen entered into letter agreements with Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey providing that, in the event
that the applicable executive receives any payments or benefits that are subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, such executive will
receive a payment that puts such executive in the same after-tax position as though such tax did not apply.
For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would be payable to Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey under their letter agreements, see the
section entitled “—Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 62 of this
proxy statement.
Retention Awards
On April 1, 2023, Seagen granted certain employees of Seagen retention awards, which vest 20% in the form of cash on the 9-month anniversary of the
grant, 30% in the form of Seagen RSUs on the 18-month anniversary of the grant, 25% in the form of Seagen RSUs on the 24-month anniversary of the
grant, and 25% in the form of Seagen RSUs on the 30-month anniversary of the grant. At the effective time, each outstanding Seagen RSU granted as part
of the retention awards will be substituted with a Pfizer cash award in accordance with the treatment generally applicable to Seagen post-signing RSUs,
subject to substantially the same terms as applied to the awards prior to the effective time. In the event of an employee’s termination following the
effective time without “cause” (as defined in Seagen’s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), or due to death or disability, the portion of the
retention awards scheduled to vest on and prior to the 24-month anniversary of the grant (75% of the total award) will vest.
For an estimate of the value of the retention awards described above that would be payable to Seagen’s NEOs upon a qualifying termination, see the
section entitled “—Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 62 of this
proxy statement.
Annual Bonus
If the date the closing of the merger occurs (the “closing date”) prior to the date bonuses in respect of the 2023 fiscal year would be paid in the ordinary
course, Seagen may pay each of its eligible employees an annual bonus for 2023 (pro-rated for the portion of 2023 elapsed as of the closing, if the closing
occurs on or before December 31, 2023) based on actual performance as of the closing date. If the closing date occurs after January 1, 2024, on a
subsequent termination without “cause” (as determined by Pfizer in a manner consistent with Pfizer’s plans), a prorated bonus in respect of the 2024
fiscal year will be paid based on target performance if the termination is prior to July 1, 2024, or actual performance if the termination is on or after July 1,
2024 (and reasonably determinable).
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Seagen’s directors and officers will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. For a description of such ongoing indemnification and coverage
obligations, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 82 of this
proxy statement.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Seagen’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which
requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each NEO of Seagen that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. This
compensation is referred to as
 
-61-
Table of Contents
“golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of Seagen stockholders.
The table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of Seagen’s NEOs would receive in connection with the merger, assuming (1)
that the merger was consummated, and each such NEO experienced a qualifying termination on December 31, 2023 (which is the assumed date solely for
purposes of this golden parachute compensation disclosure); (2) a per share price of our common stock of $229.00 (the merger consideration); (3) that
each NEO’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in effect as of the date of this proxy statement; and (4) equity awards
that are outstanding as of April 7, 2023.
The calculations in the table below do not include any amounts that the NEOs were entitled to receive or that will vest per their terms prior to December
31, 2023. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional awards or grants that may occur prior to the effective time, including annual
grants of long-term incentive awards scheduled for August 2023, or any forfeitures that may occur prior to the effective time. As a result of the foregoing
assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table,
the actual amounts, if any, to be received by an NEO may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
Because the closing of the merger will constitute a “change in control” under the employment agreements and/or compensation arrangements in which
Seagen’s NEOs participate, “double trigger” in this disclosure refers to benefits that also require a qualifying termination of employment.

and target annual bonus (provided, that the sum of such annual base salary and annual target bonus amount is multiplied by 3, in the case of Mr.
Epstein, multiplied by 2, in the case of Dr. Dansey and multiplied by 1.5 in the case of the other NEOs), the cash portion (20%) of retention awards
granted in connection with Seagen’s retention program. Mr. Epstein received a $6 million relocation

award in March 2023 in connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer; the amounts payable or recoupable by Seagen in connection
with such relocation award are not included in the values provided in this table. The amounts provided in the table do not include each NEO’s
annual bonus payable in respect of 2023, which is payable based on actual performance at the closing and will be pro-rated for when the closing
occurs if before December 31, 2023 (the 2023 target bonuses for the NEOs are $2,250,000 for Mr. Epstein, $1,258,400 for Mr. Dansey, $423,762 for Mr.
Simpson, $327,600 for Mr. Romp, $421,785 for Ms. Liu and $368,597 for Mr. Himes). The cash lump sum severance and, to the extent unvested at the
time of termination, retention award payments are “double trigger” and become payable only upon a qualifying termination. The estimated amount
of each such payment is shown in the following table.

(a) The Seagen Options, Seagen RSUs (other than post-signing Seagen RSUs and retention RSUs that remain unvested as of the effective time)
and Seagen non-product PSUs are “single trigger” and will be paid out at the effective time. Seagen non-product PSUs will be paid at the greater of
target and actual performance and are listed here based on the current projection of actual performance, which was determined by using the current
30-day stock price average of Seagen’s peers and the merger consideration. These non-product PSUs include 4,980 special development PSUs held
by Dr. Dansey, which have performance vested and are scheduled to time vest on January 15, 2024. Seagen Options held by Mr. Epstein and Dr.
Dansey that are subject to performance goals based on stock price hurdles are reported here based on actual performance based on the merger
consideration.
(b) At the effective time, each outstanding Seagen RSU granted as part of the retention awards will be substituted with a Pfizer cash award, and are
“double trigger,” and in the event of a qualifying termination, 75% of the total grant date value of the award (68.75% of the Seagen RSU portion)
will vest and is included here. The remaining portion of the award will be forfeited and is excluded here.
(c) Seagen product PSUs will be converted into cash-based awards at the effective time and are “double trigger,” and will only be paid out in the
event of a qualifying termination, but in such event will remain subject to achievement of performance conditions. Seagen product PSUs are listed
here based on target performance.

Table of Contents
(4)
Benefits. Amounts shown reflect the value of the applicable multiple of continued COBRA coverage payable by Seagen to Seagen’s NEOs (and the
NEO’s spouse and dependents, as applicable). Such benefits are “double trigger” and become payable only upon a qualifying termination under
the terms of the NEO’s employment agreement.
(5)
Tax Reimbursement. Because Mr. Epstein was recently hired as Seagen’s chief executive officer in November 2022, and Dr. Dansey was the interim
chief executive officer in 2022 and transitioned into the role of president, research & development and chief medical officer in 2022, in connection
with these appointments, both Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey received substantial performance-based equity compensation awards in 2022 in order to
facilitate an alignment of interests between the executive and Seagen stockholders. Notwithstanding the strong positive alignment these
performance awards have with stockholders, these performance awards have much worse treatment under Section 4999 of the Code than time
vested awards. In light of these considerations, on March 12, 2023, Seagen entered into letter agreements with Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey
providing that, in the event that the applicable executive receives any payments or benefits that are subject to an excise tax imposed by Section
4999 of the Code, such executive will receive a payment that puts such executive in the same after-tax position as though such tax did not apply. A
preliminary estimate of the amount of the payments that would be payable to Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey under the 280G letter agreements upon a
change in control on December 31, 2023 are provided in the table, although the final amount will not be known until the closing. The payments are
“single trigger,” but the estimates provided assume that Mr. Epstein and Dr. Dansey experience a qualifying termination. If the closing occurs on or
after January 1, 2024, it is anticipated that such payments and benefits would be substantially lower.

On the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, the closing will occur at 9:00 a.m. (New York time)
on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) (described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger,” beginning on page 84 of this proxy statement) of all of the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
prior to the closing), by electronic exchange of deliverables, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Seagen and Pfizer.
Assuming timely receipt of required regulatory approvals and clearances and satisfaction of other closing conditions, including obtaining the requisite
Seagen stockholder approval, we currently expect the closing to occur in late 2023 or early 2024.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, on the closing date, the parties will file the certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by the DGCL.
The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such
later time as Seagen and Pfizer may agree in writing and specify in the certificate of merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL).
Following the completion of the merger, our common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Seagen
will cease to be a public company.

The respective obligations of the parties to effect the merger are subject to certain regulatory approvals and clearances. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until (i) the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the
HSR Act has expired or been terminated and (ii) any agreements not to close the transaction with any governmental authority have expired or been
terminated. In addition to antitrust approval in the United States, the completion of the merger is conditioned on approvals and clearances in accordance
with antitrust laws and foreign investment laws in certain other jurisdictions.
The merger agreement also provides that if, prior to the effective time of the merger (i) the CMA indicates in writing to Pfizer that it has decided to formally
investigate the merger and, accordingly, requests Pfizer to submit a merger notice in the form prescribed under the Enterprise Act 2002, (ii) the EC
indicates in writing to Pfizer that a member state of the European Union or the EC is making, or has made, a referral of the merger to the EC under Article
22 of the EU Merger Regulation or (iii) a merger control, foreign direct investment or national security inquiry or review is initiated or commenced by
certain other governmental authorities, approval of the merger by the CMA, the EC or such other governmental authority, as the case may be, will be a
condition precedent to completion of the merger.
On April 5, 2023, Pfizer filed a briefing paper with the EC. On April 21, 2023, Pfizer filed a briefing paper with the CMA.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, the FTC or the DOJ (notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or
the expiration or termination of any agreement with the FTC or DOJ) could take such action under antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in
the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger and seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Seagen or Pfizer. At any time
before or after the completion of the merger, any state or non-U.S. governmental authority could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger and seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of Seagen or Pfizer. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
There can be no assurance that all of the regulatory approvals described above, or any other regulatory approvals that might be required to consummate
the merger, will be sought or obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any approvals, the ability to obtain the approvals on
satisfactory terms or the absence of any litigation challenging such approvals. There can also be no assurance that the FTC, the DOJ or any other
governmental authority or any private party will not attempt to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds, and, if such a challenge is made, there can be
no assurance as to its result. You should read the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Filings and Efforts to Consummate the Merger”

The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for such
purposes, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who receives cash in the
merger in exchange for shares of our common stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between the amount of cash that the U.S. holder receives pursuant to the merger with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis

Summary
On March 12, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Seagen entered into the voting agreement with Pfizer and Baker Bros., on
behalf of itself and the persons listed on Schedule A thereto in their respective capacities as record or beneficial owners of shares of our common stock,
pursuant to which, Baker Bros. agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement, among other things, until the
Expiration Time, at every meeting of Seagen stockholders at which any of the following matters are to be voted on (and at every adjournment or
postponement thereof), and on any action or approval of Seagen stockholders by written consent with respect to such matters, Baker Bros. will vote
(including via proxy) (or cause the holder of record on the record date to vote (including via proxy)) all of the Covered Shares: (a) in favor of the merger
agreement proposal; and (b) against (1) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to Seagen’s
obligations to complete the merger not being fulfilled or result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Seagen contained in the merger agreement, or of Baker Bros. contained in the voting agreement, and (2) any acquisition proposal (as
defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation; Adverse Recommendation Changes,” beginning on page 77 of this proxy
statement), or any agreement, transaction or other matter that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, impede or interfere with the
consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. At the close of business on the record date, the Covered
Shares represented approximately 25.0% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock.
By entering into the voting agreement, Baker Bros. has agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement, until the
Expiration Time, at the special meeting (and at every adjournment or
 
-66-Table of Contents
postponement thereof), to cause each stockholder identified in the voting agreement to be represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting (or
cause the holders of record as of the record date to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Covered Shares to be counted
as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
Under the voting agreement, Baker Bros. has agreed that, until the Expiration Time, neither Baker Bros. or any stockholder identified in the voting
agreement will Transfer (as defined in the voting agreement) or cause or permit the Transfer of any Covered Shares of any such stockholder, other than
with the prior written consent of Pfizer; provided that Baker Bros. and any such stockholder may, without the consent of Pfizer (i) Transfer Covered
Shares to any controlled affiliate of Baker Bros. or any such stockholder, (ii) Transfer up to 4 million Covered Shares in connection with a pro rata
distribution of Covered Shares held by 667, L.P. to its partners, (iii) Transfer up to 1.4 million Covered Shares to any charitable foundation or organization
and (iv) subsequent to the date that the requisite Seagen stockholder approval is obtained, Transfer up to 4.7 million Covered Shares in any calendar year
to any other person or persons; provided, further, that any Transfer will be permitted pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above only if the transferee(s) of any
such Transfer agrees in writing (reasonably satisfactory to Pfizer) prior to such Transfer to be bound by the terms and conditions of the voting agreement
with respect to the applicable Covered Shares as if such transferee(s) were Baker Bros. Shares of our common stock transferred pursuant to clauses (iii) or
(iv) of the preceding sentence will cease to be Covered Shares after such Transfer.
Under the voting agreement, Baker Bros. has agreed, until the Expiration Time, not to, and to cause the stockholders identified in the voting agreement
not to, take any action, in its capacity as the holder of voting and dispositive power over the Covered Shares, that would directly or indirectly have the
effect of preventing, materially delaying or materially impairing Baker Bros. from performing any of its obligations under the voting agreement or that
would, or would reasonably be expected to, have the effect of preventing, materially delaying or materially impairing, the consummation of the merger or
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the performance by Seagen of its obligations under the merger agreement.
The voting agreement will automatically terminate without further action by Seagen, Pfizer or Baker Bros. and will have no further force or effect as of (a)
the effective time, (b) such time as the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (c) the termination of the voting agreement by written
agreement of all of Seagen, Pfizer and Baker Bros., (d) the date on which any amendment to the merger agreement is effected, or any waiver of Seagen’s
rights under the merger agreement is granted, in each case without Baker Bros.’s prior written consent, that (i) diminishes (in any amount) the merger
consideration to be received by Seagen stockholders, (ii) changes the form of the merger consideration payable to Seagen stockholders, (iii) extends the
outside date beyond December 31, 2024 or (iv) imposes any additional conditions or obligations that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede

The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and
are not intended to provide any factual information about Seagen, Pfizer or Merger Sub or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Seagen
or Pfizer contained in this proxy statement or in Seagen’s or Pfizer’s public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the merger agreement and this
summary are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts and circumstances relating to
Seagen or Pfizer. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by and covenants of Seagen, Pfizer and Merger Sub that were made only
for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely
for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with negotiating the terms of the
merger agreement (including by being qualified by the confidential disclosure letter exchanged between the parties to the merger agreement) and may be
subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors. In particular, in your review of the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations
and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right
not to close the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and
allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. Information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the
merger agreement.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, the closing will occur at 9:00 a.m. (New York time)
on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of all of the closing conditions (described in the

Seagen Common Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of common
stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by Seagen as treasury shares, by Pfizer or Merger Sub or
by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Seagen or Pfizer) (each, an “eligible share”) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to $229.00, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. From and after the effective time, all eligible shares will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and
 
-69-Table of Contents
extinguished and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate share (a “certificate”) or book-entry share (a “book-entry share”) (as applicable)
representing any eligible shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the merger consideration therefor, without
interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes, upon the surrender of such certificate or transfer of such book-entry share (as applicable) in
accordance with the merger agreement.
Stock Options. At the effective time, each Seagen Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then vested, will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the
per share exercise price of such Seagen Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen Option (which
number, in the case of Seagen Options subject to performance goals based on stock price hurdles, will be determined based on actual performance in
accordance with the terms of such Seagen Options, with any Seagen Options that do not vest being forfeited for no consideration), net of applicable
taxes and without interest.
RSUs. At the effective time, each Seagen RSU, other than any post-signing Seagen RSU, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time,
whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger
consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen RSU, net of applicable taxes and without interest.
Each post-signing Seagen RSU will be substituted automatically with a Pfizer cash award with respect to an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
merger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such post-signing Seagen RSU. Each Pfizer cash award
will otherwise be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to such post-signing Seagen RSU as of immediately prior to the
effective time. For Seagen RSUs granted in connection with Seagen’s annual grants in August 2023, one-third of the outstanding amount of such awards
will vest immediately prior to the effective time, and the remaining portion of the award will vest in equal installments on the first two annual anniversaries
of closing, or upon an earlier termination without “cause” (as defined in Seagen’s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), due to death or
disability, or for good reason.
Annual PSUs. At the effective time, each Seagen non-products PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then
vested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the merger consideration, multiplied by (ii)
the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen non-products PSU based on (a) for performance periods that are complete as of
the effective time, actual performance, and (b) for performance periods that are incomplete as of the effective time, the greater of the target and actual
performance, net of applicable taxes and without interest.
Product PSUs. At the effective time, each Seagen products PSU, that is unearned and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
substituted with a Pfizer performance cash award with respect to that number of shares of Pfizer common stock that is equal to the product of (i) the
merger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock then subject to such Seagen products PSU. Each Pfizer performance
cash award will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such Seagen PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, that, upon a termination without “cause” (as defined in Seagen’s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan), due to death or disability,
or for good reason, the service conditions that such Pfizer performance cash award is subject to will be waived, and the award will vest in full upon
achievement of performance conditions (and will be forfeited if such performance conditions are not achieved).

Pfizer will designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to Seagen to act as agent for
the holders of the eligible shares in connection with the merger (the “paying agent”) and to receive the funds to which holders of the eligible shares will
become entitled in accordance with the merger agreement. Pfizer will deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent on a timely basis, no later
than the same day as the effective time occurs to the extent that the effective time is before
 
-70-Table of Contents
1:00 p.m. (New York time), or else, the next business day, and as and when needed thereafter, cash necessary to pay for the eligible shares converted in
the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration.
Promptly after the effective time (but in no event later than five business days thereafter), the paying agent will mail to each holder of record of a stock
certificate:
 
•
a form letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificate will pass, only upon
delivery of the certificate to the paying agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as Pfizer may reasonably specify);
and
 
•
instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificate in exchange for payment of the merger consideration.
You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your certificates to the paying agent without a
letter of transmittal. Holders of book-entry shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to
receive the merger consideration that such holders are entitled to receive as a result of the merger pursuant to the merger agreement.
Upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the paying agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Pfizer, together with a letter
of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed, and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the paying agent, the holder of such
certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration (such payments to be net of applicable taxes withheld in accordance
with the merger agreement) for each share of common stock formerly represented by such certificate, and the certificate so surrendered will be cancelled.
If any payment in accordance with the merger is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate or book-entry
share is registered, it will be a condition of payment that (i) the certificate or book-entry shares surrendered will be properly endorsed or will otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and (ii) the person requesting such payment will have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the certificate or book-entry share surrendered or will have established to the satisfaction of Pfizer that such tax
either has been paid or is not applicable.
At the effective time, the stock transfer books of Seagen will be closed, and thereafter no further registration of transfers of shares of common stock will
be made on the records of Seagen.
If any certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by Pfizer or the paying agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Pfizer or the paying agent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the surviving corporation with respect to such certificate, the paying
agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the applicable merger consideration with respect thereto.
At any time following 12 months after the effective time, the surviving corporation will be entitled to require the paying agent to deliver to it any funds
(including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the paying agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject
only to the paying agent’s routine administrative procedures) to holders of certificates and book-entry shares, and thereafter such holders will be entitled
to look only to the surviving corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
the merger consideration payable upon due surrender of their certificates or book-entry shares, without any interest thereon and subject to reduction for
any applicable withholding taxes.

Seagen has agreed to cease and terminate, and to direct its representatives to cease and terminate, all solicitations, discussions and negotiations with any
person with respect to any acquisition proposal as of the date of the merger agreement.
In addition to the foregoing, Seagen has agreed that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
 
•
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal, which constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
 
•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or similar
agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any acquisition proposal; or
 
•
engage in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any non-public information or data to, any person (other than Pfizer or any of its
affiliates or representatives) relating to any acquisition proposal, or grant any waiver or release under any restriction from making an
acquisition proposal, other than discussions solely to notify such person of the non-solicitation terms of the merger agreement or to clarify
the terms and conditions of such proposal or offer.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “acquisition proposal” means a proposal or offer from any person (other than Pfizer or any of its subsidiaries)
providing (in one transaction or a series of transactions) for any: (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving Seagen or its subsidiaries, pursuant to which any person or group of related
persons would beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, 20% or more (on a non-diluted basis) of any class of equity or voting securities of
Seagen or any resulting parent company of Seagen, (ii) sale, lease, license or other disposition, directly or indirectly, of assets of Seagen (including capital
stock or other equity interests of any subsidiary) or its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets, net revenues or net income of
Seagen and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to which 20% or more of the revenues, earnings or assets of Seagen and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole and on a consolidated basis, are attributable, (iii) issuance or sale or other disposition of capital stock or other equity interests representing 20% or
more (on a non-diluted basis) of any class of equity or voting securities of Seagen, (iv) tender offer, exchange offer or any other transaction or series of
transactions that, if consummated, would result in any person or group of related persons, directly or indirectly, beneficially owning or having the right to
acquire beneficial ownership of capital stock or other equity interests representing 20% or more (on a non-diluted basis) of any class of equity or voting
securities of Seagen or (v) combination of the foregoing.
Seagen also agreed that (a) it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission or
request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is or becomes a party, and (b) it will, and will cause each of
its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to enforce any such agreement, in each case, unless the Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with Seagen’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board to
Seagen’s stockholders under applicable law, in which event Seagen may take the actions described in these clauses (a) and (b) solely to the extent
necessary to permit a third party to make an acquisition proposal, conditioned upon such third party agreeing that Seagen will not be prohibited from
providing any information to Pfizer (including regarding any such acquisition proposal) in
 
-77-Table of Contents
accordance with, and otherwise complying with, the non-solicitation obligations of Seagen. Seagen is required to promptly provide to Pfizer any non-
public information concerning Seagen or any of its subsidiaries provided or made available in accordance with the exception described in this paragraph
that was not previously provided or made available to Pfizer.
Non-Solicitation Exceptions",84,85
Seagen Inc._20230424_DEFM14A_20812583_4650531.Pdf,Non-Solicitation Exceptions,"Non-Solicitation Exceptions
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, Seagen and its representatives may
furnish non-public information concerning Seagen’s business, properties or assets to any person in accordance with a confidentiality agreement with
terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Seagen than those contained in Seagen’s confidentiality agreement with Pfizer (it being understood
that such agreement need not include a standstill provision) and may participate in discussions and negotiations with such person concerning an
acquisition proposal if, but only if, such person has submitted a bona fide proposal to Seagen relating to such acquisition proposal that (i) did not result
from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement and (ii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors, either constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. Seagen must promptly notify Pfizer of a
determination by the Board that an acquisition proposal is a superior proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “superior proposal” means a written acquisition proposal that did not result from a material breach of the non-
solicitation terms of the merger agreement (provided, that for this purpose the references to “20%” in the definition of “acquisition proposal” are deemed
to be references to “50%”) on terms (x) which the Board determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to Seagen stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (after consultation with its financial and legal advisors), taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such acquisition proposal and the merger agreement, including the likelihood that the transactions contemplated by such acquisition
proposal and the merger agreement will be completed.

Prior to the special meeting, Seagen must promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Pfizer orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal and will in no event begin providing such information or
engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.
Seagen must promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Pfizer if it or its subsidiaries or representatives receive (i) any acquisition proposal or
indication by any person that it is considering making an acquisition proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to Seagen or its
subsidiaries (other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an acquisition proposal) or (iii) any inquiry or
request for discussions or negotiations with respect to any acquisition proposal. Seagen must also provide Pfizer promptly (and in any event within such
48-hour period) with the identity of such person and a correct and complete copy of such acquisition proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where
such acquisition proposal is not in writing, a description of the material terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal, indication, inquiry or request),
including any modifications thereto.
Seagen must keep Pfizer reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any event no later than 48 hours after the occurrence of any
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any acquisition proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the
material terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto).

Under the terms of the merger agreement, neither the Board nor any of its committees may:
 
•
withdraw, amend, change, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, amend, change, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Pfizer or Merger Sub, its recommendation that Seagen stockholders adopt the merger agreement (the “Board recommendation”);
 
•
fail to make the Board recommendation in this proxy statement;
 
•
approve or recommend or declare advisable, or otherwise propose publicly to approve or recommend or declare advisable, any acquisition
proposal;
 
•
if an acquisition proposal has been publicly disclosed, fail to publicly recommend against such acquisition proposal within 10 business
days of the request of Pfizer and fail to publicly reaffirm the Board recommendation within such 10-business-day period upon such request
(any action described in this bullet and the three preceding bullets, an “adverse recommendation change”); or
 
•
enter into any agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any acquisition proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, if Seagen receives an acquisition proposal, the Board may
effect an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement to enter an agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction
contemplated by any superior proposal if, but only if, all of the following conditions are satisfied:
 
•
the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that such acquisition proposal
constitutes a superior proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments of the merger agreement that are offered in writing by Pfizer;
 
•
the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Seagen stockholders in accordance with law;
 
•
Seagen provides prior written notice to Pfizer, at least four business days in advance, of its intention to take such action with respect to
such superior proposal, which notice will specify the material terms and conditions of such superior proposal (including the identity of the
party making such superior proposal), and contemporaneously provides a correct and complete copy of the proposed agreement providing
for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by such superior proposal, provided that, in the event of any material revisions to such
superior proposal after the start of such notice period, Seagen is required to deliver a new written notice to Pfizer and comply with the
foregoing requirements, and the notice period will be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice, except that the new
notice period will be two business days;
 
•
during such notice period, Seagen negotiates and causes its representatives to negotiate with Pfizer in good faith (to the extent Pfizer
requests to negotiate) regarding any adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such acquisition proposal
ceases to constitute a superior proposal;
 
•
following any such negotiation, the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, that
such acquisition proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal; and
 
•
in the case of the termination of the merger agreement to enter into any agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction
contemplated by a superior proposal, in advance of or concurrently with such termination, Seagen (i) pays the termination fee (as defined
below) to the extent required by the merger agreement and (ii) immediately following such termination enters into a binding definitive
agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by such superior proposal.
 
-79-Table of Contents
In addition to the foregoing, prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, the Board may effect an adverse recommendation change in
response to an intervening event if, but only if, all of the following conditions are satisfied:
 
•
the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to make an adverse recommendation change on
account of an intervening event would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
 
•
Seagen provides to Pfizer at least four business days’ prior written notice advising Pfizer that the Board intends to take such action and
specifying the intervening event in reasonable detail; and
 
•
during such notice period, Seagen, if requested by Pfizer, engages in good faith negotiations with Pfizer to amend the merger agreement in
such a manner that obviates the need or reason for the adverse recommendation change.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “intervening event” means a material event, fact, circumstance, development, occurrence or change not known to
the Board, or the magnitude or consequences of which were not reasonably foreseen by the Board, at the time the Board initially resolved to make the
Board recommendation, which event, fact, circumstance, development, occurrence, change, magnitude or consequences become known to the Board
prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval. No acquisition proposal will constitute an intervening event.

days from the date of mailing this proxy statement is insufficient time to submit and obtain the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, such later date to
which Pfizer consents, such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). Seagen is permitted to postpone or adjourn the special
meeting if, but only if:
 
•
Seagen is unable to obtain a quorum of its stockholders at such time, to the extent necessary to obtain a quorum of stockholders;
 
•
there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or represented by proxy at such meeting to obtain the requisite Seagen stockholder
approval, to allow reasonable time for solicitation of proxies for the purposes of obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval;

comments made by the SEC with respect to this proxy statement or to allow reasonable time for the mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure required thereby; or
 
•
Seagen is required to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Seagen has agreed that (i) to the extent permitted by applicable law, it may not postpone or adjourn the special meeting by more than 15 calendar days
past the originally scheduled date without Pfizer’s prior consent (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld), (ii) if
applicable, Seagen will respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to resolve any SEC comments, (iii) Seagen will reconvene the special meeting at the
earliest practicable date on which the Board reasonably expects to have sufficient affirmative votes for Seagen stockholders to adopt the merger

regarding the merger in connection with such filings. If any party or affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any governmental authority with respect to the merger pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust laws or foreign investment laws applicable to
the merger, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with

exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of Seagen’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect
immediately prior to the effective time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time and will not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any indemnified parties, except to the extent required by
applicable law; provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim made for indemnification within such period will continue until the
disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. From and after the effective time, Pfizer will guarantee and stand surety for, and will cause the
surviving corporation to honor, certain indemnification contracts, and Pfizer will not, and will cause its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation)
not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such contracts in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any indemnified parties.
Prior to the effective time, Seagen will or, if unable to, Pfizer will cause the surviving corporation, as of the effective time, to purchase from Seagen’s
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier as of the date of the merger agreement, or one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit
rating as such carrier, a six-year prepaid “tail” policy, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable to the insureds than
the coverage provided under Seagen’s existing policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with respect to
matters arising on or before the effective time (including in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated by the
merger agreement), and Pfizer will cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the surviving corporation, provided that Seagen may not pay, and the surviving corporation will not be required to pay, in excess of a
specified amount. If Seagen or the surviving corporation for any reason fails to obtain such “tail” insurance policies prior to or as of the effective time,
Pfizer will, for a period of six years from the effective time, cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Seagen as of the date of the merger agreement with Seagen’s directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance carrier as of the date of the merger agreement, or one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as such
carrier, with respect to matters arising on or before the effective time; provided that after the effective time, Pfizer will not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of a specified amount, but in such case will purchase as much coverage as practicable for such amount.

Until the first anniversary of the effective time (or an earlier termination of the relevant employee’s employment), each employee of Seagen or any of
Seagen’s subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries following the effective time (a “continuing
employee”) will be

provided (i) an annual base salary or wage rate and annual target cash bonus opportunity that are, in each case, no less favorable than the annual base
salary or wage rate and annual target cash bonus opportunity provided to such continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time, and (ii)
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding equity compensation, change in control,
transaction or retention payments, defined benefit, nonqualified deferred compensation, severance benefits, post-retirement or retiree medical benefits)
that are in effect immediately prior to the date of the merger agreement. Each continuing employee will be provided certain severance benefits.
As of the effective time, all continuing employees in the United States (and in any other jurisdiction where permitted by law) will become subject to
Pfizer’s vaccine mandate, which requires colleagues to be fully vaccinated and to provide proof of full vaccination or to be granted a medical or religious
accommodation by Pfizer.
Subject to certain exceptions provided under the merger agreement, with respect to each applicable benefit plan of Pfizer or its affiliates, each continuing
employee who participates in any such plan will receive service credit for all periods of employment with Seagen or any of Seagen’s subsidiaries, as
applicable, prior to the effective time for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility, in each case, in accordance with the terms of such plans, to
the same extent and for the same purposes thereunder as such service was recognized under an analogous benefit plan in effect on the date of the merger

Any termination of the merger agreement will be effective immediately upon the delivery of a written notice of the terminating party to the non-terminating
party hereto and, if then due, payment of the termination fee or reverse termination fee, as applicable. If terminated, the merger agreement will become null
and void and be of no further force or effect and there will be no liability on the part of Seagen, Pfizer or Merger Sub (or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, agents or representatives), except with respect to certain provisions specified in the merger agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will relieve any party from liability for actual and intentional fraud in the making of any of its representations and
warranties set forth in the merger agreement or willful breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in the merger agreement.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “willful breach” means, with respect to any agreement or covenant in the merger agreement, a material breach that
is the consequence of an act or omission taken or omitted to be taken that the breaching party intentionally takes (or intentionally fails to take) with the
knowledge that such act or omission would cause a material breach of such agreement or covenant.

•
Pfizer terminates the merger agreement because, prior to obtaining the requisite Seagen stockholder approval, the Board makes an adverse
recommendation change, in which case the termination fee will be payable by Seagen to Pfizer promptly but in no event later than two
business days after the date of receipt of Pfizer’s termination notice;

requisite Seagen stockholder approval is not obtained or (C) of a breach by Seagen of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement of Seagen set forth
 
-87-Table of Contents
in the merger agreement and, at the time of such termination, the requisite Seagen stockholder approval has not been obtained, (ii) prior to
such termination, an acquisition proposal has been publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn at least four business days prior to the
special meeting and (iii) within 12 months of such termination, Seagen enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an acquisition
proposal that is ultimately consummated or an acquisition proposal is consummated (provided that, for such purposes, the references to
“20%” in the definition of acquisition proposal are deemed to be references to “50%”), in which case the termination fee will be payable by
Seagen to Pfizer upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such acquisition proposal.

(including attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with pursuing such payment and will pay interest on the amount of the payment at the
prime rate of Bank of America (or its successors or assigns) in effect on the date the payment was payable.

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Seagen is required to submit a proposal to Seagen
stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of
Seagen that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. This compensation is
summarized in the table under “The Merger—Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Payments and
Benefits to Seagen’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” including the footnotes to the table. This proposal is commonly known as
“say-on-golden parachutes,” and we refer to it as the compensation proposal.
The Board encourages you to review carefully the compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.
The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Seagen approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Seagen hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid, or become payable,
to Seagen’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the
table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Interests of Seagen’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Payments
and Benefits to Seagen’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative
disclosures.”
The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may
vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the compensation proposal
is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Seagen or Pfizer. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and the merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Seagen
stockholders.
Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, the above resolution approving the compensation proposal on an advisory basis will require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively for the proposal via the virtual meeting website or by proxy at the special
meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the compensation proposal.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER",99,102
Seagen Inc._20230424_DEFM14A_20812583_4650531.Pdf,MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER,"MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of our
common stock whose shares of our common stock are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the
Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretation at any time,
possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in
this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax
considerations described in this discussion. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion has been or will be rendered, regarding
any matter discussed below or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:
 
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
•
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
 
•
a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more “United
States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust has a valid
election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a “United States Person” (within the meaning of the Code); or
 
•
an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of our common stock who hold such shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a
complete analysis or to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular facts and
circumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, holders
who are not U.S. holders, insurance companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, dealers or brokers in securities,
commodities or foreign currencies, dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of our common
stock, holders that directly, indirectly or constructively own or have owned 5% or more of the combined voting power of our common stock, or of the
total value of our common stock, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, tax-deferred accounts,
retirement plans or accounts, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, pension funds, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, U.S.
expatriates, former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code, partnerships (or other
entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in any
such entities, grantor trusts, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders who hold shares of our common stock as part of a
hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction or other integrated investment, holders that directly, indirectly or constructively own an
equity interest in Pfizer, holders required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to our common stock as a result of such
income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement, and holders who acquired their shares of our common stock through the exercise of
employee stock options or other compensation arrangements). This discussion also does not address any tax consequences arising under any alternative
minimum tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of
 
-95-Table of Contents
2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection
therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). In addition, no information is provided with respect to
any tax consequences under state, local, or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax (such as, for
example, U.S. federal estate or gift tax laws). This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences in respect of dissenting
shares or of any transaction other than the merger.
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner
of shares of our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners,
the activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes that holds our common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the
merger to their specific circumstances.
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the merger to any particular holder of our common stock will depend on the holder’s particular tax
circumstances. Holders of our common stock should consult their tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the merger,
including the applicability and effect of any alternative minimum tax, the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income and any other U.S.
federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws and any changes in those tax laws.
Consequences to U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of our common stock
pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that the U.S. holder receives
pursuant to the merger and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock will
generally equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for such shares.
If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of our common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger, any
gain or loss so recognized by the U.S. holder will generally be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders,
including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a
U.S. holder acquired different blocks of our common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and
holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. holders in connection with the merger.
Payments made in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be subject to backup withholding (currently, at a rate of
24%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return IRS Form W-9, certifying
under penalties of perjury that such U.S. holder is a “United States person” (within the meaning of the Code), the taxpayer identification number provided
is correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding, and must otherwise comply with all applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner. U.S. holders are urged to
consult their tax advisors as to the qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining the exemption.

Seagen Inc._20230424_DEFM14A_20812583_4650531.Pdf,APPRAISAL RIGHTS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS
If the merger is completed, holders of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time who do not vote in favor
of the merger agreement proposal, who validly demand appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn their demand or
otherwise waived or lost their rights to appraisal are entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL.
This section is intended only as a brief summary of certain provisions of the statutory procedures that a person must follow under the DGCL in order to
seek and perfect appraisal rights in connection with the merger. The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal
rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at
the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and is incorporated by reference herein. The
following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons entitled to appraisal exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to follow precisely the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for demanding and perfecting
appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a (i) “stockholder” are to the record
holder of shares of our common stock, (ii) “beneficial owner” are to a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and (iii) “person” are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or
other entity.
Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger agreement will be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, a company must notify each
of its stockholders who was a stockholder of record on the record date for notice of such meeting, with respect to shares of our common stock for which
appraisal rights are available, not less than 20 days before the special meeting to vote on the merger agreement, that appraisal rights are available. Either a
copy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be included with the notice or the notice must direct stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at
which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost.
This proxy statement constitutes Seagen’s notice pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in
connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262, in
compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, which is accessible at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262,
particularly the procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights. Failure to strictly comply, timely and properly, with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of our common stock, Seagen encourages stockholders considering exercising such rights to consult with
your legal and financial advisors.
If you wish to demand appraisal of your shares of our common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: (i) you must deliver to Seagen a
written demand for an appraisal of your shares of our common stock before the vote is taken on the merger agreement proposal at the special meeting,
which written demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder of record of shares of our common stock who intends to demand
appraisal of such person’s shares of our common stock; (ii) you must hold your shares of our common stock from the date of making such demand and
continue to hold your shares of our common stock through the effective time; (iii) you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of, or consent in writing
to, the merger agreement proposal with respect to your shares of our common stock for which you intend to demand appraisal; (iv) you or any other
person entitled to demand an appraisal in connection with the merger must not thereafter withdraw your demand for appraisal of your shares of our
common stock or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL; and (v) you otherwise meet the criteria and follow the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
 
-98-Table of Contents
If any of these conditions is not satisfied with respect to any of your shares of our common stock and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to
receive the merger consideration for such shares of our common stock as provided in the merger agreement, but you will not have appraisal rights with
respect to such shares of our common stock. A proxy with respect to any such shares of our common stock that is submitted and does not contain voting
instructions will, unless revoked, be voted “FOR” the merger agreement proposal, result in the loss of the stockholder’s right of appraisal with respect to
such shares of our common stock and nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal in respect thereof. Therefore, a stockholder who
submits a proxy for such person’s shares of our common stock and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights with respect to such shares of our common
stock must either revoke such proxy, submit a later-dated proxy with respect to such shares of our common stock containing instructions to vote
“AGAINST” the merger agreement proposal or “ABSTAIN” from voting on the merger agreement proposal or attend the special meeting and vote
“AGAINST” the merger agreement proposal or “ABSTAIN” from voting on the merger agreement proposal with respect to such shares of our common
stock. Voting against or failing to vote for the merger agreement proposal by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of
Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the merger agreement proposal.
Record Holders
A demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform us of the identity of
the stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder’s shares of our common stock in connection with the
merger. If a holder of record is submitting a demand with respect to shares of our common stock owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares of our
common stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf
of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is
acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of record, such as a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of our
common stock as nominee or intermediary for one or more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of our common stock
held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the
number of shares of our common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of our common stock is expressly mentioned, the
demand will be presumed to cover all shares of our common stock held in the name of the holder of record.
Beneficial Owners
A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares of our common stock in accordance with
the procedures of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 of the DGCL summarized above, provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such
shares of our common stock through the effective time and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of
subsection (a) of Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares of
our common stock for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and
a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner
consents to receive notices given by Seagen under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the verified list (defined below). The shares of our
common stock are currently listed on a national securities exchange, and, assuming such shares of our common stock remain listed on a national
securities exchange immediately prior to the merger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of our common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total
number of shares of our common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for appraisal or (y) the
value of
 
-99-
Table of Contents
the aggregate consideration offered pursuant to the merger Agreement in respect of such total number of shares of our common stock exceeds $1.0
million. We refer to these conditions as the “minimum conditions.”
Although not expressly required by Section 262 of the DGCL, Seagen reserves the right to take the position that it may require the submission of all
information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any person sharing beneficial ownership of
the shares of our common stock for which such demand is submitted. All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be
mailed or delivered to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE, Bothell, Washington 98021. Demands for appraisal may not be submitted by
electronic transmission.
Actions After Consummation of the Merger
If the merger is consummated, within 10 days after the effective time, Seagen, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will notify each Seagen
stockholder of record who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who has not voted in favor of the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement, and any beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
At any time within 60 days after the effective time, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a
proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger
agreement by delivering to us a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, either Seagen,
as the surviving corporation to the merger, or any person who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served
on Seagen, as the surviving corporation, in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the
fair value of the shares of our common stock held by all Seagen stockholders entitled to appraisal. Seagen, as the surviving corporation to the merger, is
under no obligation to file any such petition and has no present intent of doing so. Accordingly, it is your obligation to initiate all necessary action to
perfect your appraisal rights in respect of your shares of our common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. All demands for
appraisal (i) should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE, Bothell, Washington 98021 and (ii) must be delivered to Seagen
before the vote is taken on the merger agreement proposal at the special meeting. The demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Seagen of the
identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of the fair value of such person’s shares of our common stock. The
failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of shares of our common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL,
and deliver to Seagen the written demand for appraisal prior to the taking of the vote on the merger agreement proposal at the special meeting, will result
in the loss of appraisal rights.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled,
upon written request, to receive from Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of our
common stock not voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which we have received demands for
appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares of our common stock (provided that, where a
beneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the record holder of such shares of our common stock will not be considered a separate
stockholder holding such shares of our common stock for purposes of such aggregate number). Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger, must
give this statement to the requesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10
days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of our common stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is served upon
Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger, then Seagen, as the
 
-100-
Table of Contents
surviving corporation of the merger, will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified
list (the “verified list”) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares of our common stock and with
whom agreements as to the value of their shares of our common stock have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger,
and all Seagen stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication will be
approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs of these notices will be borne by Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger.
After providing notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to
determine those persons who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware
Court of Chancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares of our common stock to submit their stock certificates to the
Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that direction,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
In addition, assuming our common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all our stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless one of the minimum conditions is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of our common stock
subject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of
Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered,
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that,
in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise
and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on the future prospects of the merged corporation. Section
262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In
Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,
the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof
as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of our common stock as so determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal
of their shares of our common stock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement is not an opinion as to, and might not in any manner address, “fair value” under Section 262 of
the DGCL. Although we believe that the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, no representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering exercising appraisal rights
 
-101-
Table of Contents
should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration offered
pursuant to the merger agreement. Neither Seagen nor Pfizer anticipates offering more than the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger
agreement to any holder of shares of our common stock exercising appraisal rights, and Seagen and Pfizer each reserve the right to make a voluntary cash
payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL,
the “fair value” of a share of our common stock is less than the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement. If a demand for appraisal
is duly withdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, neither of the minimum conditions is met (assuming our common stock remained listed on a
national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time) or other requirements imposed by Section 262 of the DGCL to perfect and seek
appraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an appraisal will cease.
Upon application by Seagen, as the surviving corporation of the merger, or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any
person whose name appears on the verified list may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares of our common stock by Seagen, as the surviving corporation of
the merger, to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery
may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person
whose name appears on the verified list who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares of our common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of
Section 262 of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under subsection (k) of Section 262 of the DGCL. In the
absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of such person’s shares of our common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or loses or
successfully withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of our common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the
effective time into the right to receive the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose
or withdraw, such person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time, neither of the minimum conditions
is met (assuming our common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time) or if the person delivers to
Seagen a written withdrawal of the person’s demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
From and after the effective time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares of our common stock
will be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares of our
common stock, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record as of a time prior to the effective time. If no petition for an
appraisal is filed, if neither of the minimum conditions is met (assuming our common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately
prior to the effective time), or if the person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to Seagen a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in
respect of some or all of such person’s shares of our common stock within 60 days after the effective time in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
then the right of such person to an appraisal of such shares of our common stock will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court
of Chancery, however,
 
-102-
Table of Contents
no appraisal proceeding will be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application
to the Delaware Court of Chancery made under subsection (j) of Section 262 of the DGCL, provided that this sentence does not affect the right of any
person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and
to accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after the effective time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of a stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s
statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult with your legal and financial advisors
before attempting to exercise those rights. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL,
Section 262 of the DGCL will govern.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and
annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable,
addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for
stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Seagen and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple stockholders who request a
copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your
broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you
revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please
notify your broker if your shares of our common stock are held in a brokerage account or Seagen if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by
sending a written request to our Corporate Secretary at 21823 30th Drive SE, Bothell, Washington 98021, or by calling (425) 527-4000. Stockholders who
share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a single copy by notifying Seagen
at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition, Seagen will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or
telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was
delivered pursuant to a prior request.

If the merger is completed prior to Seagen’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2024 annual meeting”), Seagen will not hold an annual meeting of
stockholders in 2024 and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of Seagen’s stockholders because, following the merger, our common
stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Seagen will no longer be a public company. However, if the
merger is not completed prior to the 2024 annual meeting, the following deadlines apply to the submission of stockholder proposals to be considered at
the 2024 annual meeting.
To have your proposal included in our proxy statement for the 2024 annual meeting, you must submit your proposal in writing by December 20, 2023, to
Jean I. Liu, Corporate Secretary, Seagen, 21823 – 30th Drive SE, Bothell, Washington 98021, and you must comply with all applicable requirements of Rule
14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act. However, if the 2024 annual meeting is not held between May 1, 2024 and June 30, 2024, then the deadline will
be a reasonable time prior to the time we begin to print and send our proxy materials. In addition, to comply with the universal proxy rules, stockholders
who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than our nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule
14a-19 under the Exchange Act. However, if the 2024 annual meeting is not held between May 1, 2024 and June 30, 2024, then the deadline will be the later
of 90 days prior to the 2024 annual meeting or the 10th calendar day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2024 annual
meeting is first made by Seagen.
Stockholders wishing to submit proposals or director nominations for our 2024 annual meeting that are not to be included in our proxy statement must
give timely written notice to our Corporate Secretary in accordance with our bylaws. To be “timely,” written notice must be received by our Corporate
Secretary at the above address no earlier than January 31, 2024 and no later than March 2, 2024; provided, however, that in the event the date of the 2024
annual meeting is not scheduled to be held between May 1, 2024 and June 30, 2024, then such notice must be received by the later of the 90th day prior to
the date of the 2024 annual meeting or the 10th day following the date on which public announcement or disclosure of the date of the 2024 annual
meeting is first made. However, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board is increased and either all of the nominees for director
or the size of the increased Board is not publicly announced or disclosed by Seagen on or prior to February 20, 2024, a stockholder’s notice to our
Corporate Secretary will also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if the stockholder’s
notice is delivered to our Corporate Secretary at the above address not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the first date all of such
nominees or the size of the increased Board has been publicly announced or disclosed by Seagen.
We also advise you to review our bylaws, which contain additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder proposals and director
nominations, including attendance requirements. A stockholder’s notice to our Corporate Secretary must set forth the information required by our bylaws
with respect to each nominee or matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the 2024 annual meeting and must be updated not later than 10 days
after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the 2024 annual meeting to provide any material changes in the foregoing
information. The person presiding at the 2024 annual meeting may determine, if the facts warrant, that a nominee or matter has not been properly brought
before the annual meeting and, therefore, may not be considered at the annual meeting. In addition, the proxy solicited by the Board for the 2024 annual
meeting will confer discretionary voting authority with respect to (i) any proposal presented by a stockholder at that meeting for which Seagen has not
been provided with timely notice and (ii) any proposal made in accordance with our bylaws, if the 2024 proxy statement briefly describes the matter and
how management proxy holders intend to vote on it, if the stockholder does not comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-4(c)(2) promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
PREAMBLE
THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”), dated as of March 12, 2023, is by and among Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Parent”), Aris Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and Seagen Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”).
RECITALS
WHEREAS, each of the board of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company has approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the “Merger”)
in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Company Board of Directors”) has (i) determined that the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Company’s shareholders; (ii) approved and declared it advisable to
enter into this Agreement and the Voting Agreement (as defined below); (iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote of the
Company’s shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting (as defined below); and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, resolved to
recommend that the Company’s shareholders approve the adoption of this Agreement and approve the Merger on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein (the “Company Board Recommendation”);
WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Baker Bros. Advisors LP (the “Advisor”) is entering into a voting agreement on
behalf of itself and the persons listed on Schedule A thereto with Parent and the Company (the “Voting Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other
things, the Advisor has agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement, to vote (or cause to be voted) all of the
Covered Shares (as defined in the Voting Agreement) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
SECTION 1 - THE MERGER
1.1 The Merger.
(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Merger Sub will consummate the Merger in accordance
with the DGCL, such that, at the Effective Time, (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub will thereupon cease, (ii) the Company will be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger and will continue to be governed by the Laws of
the State of Delaware, (iii) the corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers, objects and purposes will continue
and (iv) the Company will automatically assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub. The corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes referred
to as the “Surviving Corporation.” The Merger will have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, objects and purposes of the Company and Merger
Sub will be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all claims, debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub will be the claims, debts,
liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Corporation.
Table of Contents
(b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company will, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its
entirety to be as set forth in Annex II and, as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The name of the Surviving Corporation will be “Seagen Inc.”
(c) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company will be
amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all

Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.
1.2 Effective Time. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cause a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) to be executed and filed on
the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the
DGCL. The Merger will become effective at the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, or at such other date and time as the parties hereto will agree in writing (subject to the requirements of the DGCL) and will specify in the

all of the conditions set forth in Section 7 (other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of such conditions at or prior to the Closing) (the date on which the Closing occurs, the “Closing Date”), by electronic exchange of

1.4 Directors and Officers of the Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will, from and after the Effective
Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will, from and after the

qualified, or until their earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation’s certificate of incorporation
and bylaws.
1.5 Subsequent Actions. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. If at any time after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right and title to, or interest in, any of the rights,
properties or assets of either the Company or Merger Sub held or to be held by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger
or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,

SECTION 2 - CONVERSION OF SECURITIES
2.1 Conversion of Shares. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of
common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Shares”), or any shares of common stock of Merger Sub, $0.01 per share
(“Merger Sub Common Shares”):
(a) Merger Sub Common Shares. Each issued and outstanding Merger Sub Common Share will be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. All Common Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury shares and
any Common Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub will automatically be cancelled and extinguished and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be
payable in exchange therefor. Each Common Share that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or
the Company will be converted into such number of shares of the Surviving Corporation so as to maintain relative ownership percentages.
(c) Conversion of Common Shares. Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Common Shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $229.00 (the “Merger Consideration”). From and after the Effective Time, all such Common Shares will no longer be outstanding
and will automatically be cancelled and extinguished and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate share (a “Certificate”) or book-entry share (a
“Book-Entry Share”) (as applicable) representing any such Common Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration therefor, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Book-Entry Share (as applicable) in
accordance with Section 2.2.
2.2 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Paying Agent. Parent will designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of the Common Shares in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to receive the
funds to which holders of the Common Shares will become entitled in accordance with Section 2.1(c). The agreement pursuant to which Parent shall
appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent on a timely basis, promptly after the Effective Time (and no later than the same day as the Effective Time occurs to the extent that
the Effective Time is before 1:00 p.m. (New York time), or else, the next Business Day) and as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary to
pay for the Common Shares converted in the Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the “Exchange Fund”). If the Exchange Fund is
inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of the Common Shares are entitled in accordance with Section 2.1(c), Parent will promptly deposit, or
cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit, additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments of Merger Consideration,
and Parent and the Surviving Corporation will in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Paying Agent may invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent.
(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent will
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares, whose shares were
converted in accordance with Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for payment
of the Merger

Table of Contents
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (such payments to be net of applicable
Taxes withheld in accordance with Section 2.5) for each Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered will
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest thereon, and will not evidence
any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a shareholder or other equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal
to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Common Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration will upon receipt by the Paying Agent of
such evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, be entitled to receive, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration in respect of each such Common Share, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder will forthwith
be cancelled.
(c) Certain Transfer Taxes. If any payment in accordance with the Merger is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it will be a condition of payment that (i) the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered will be
properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment will have paid all transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or will have established
to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. None of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation will have
any liability for the transfer Taxes and other similar Taxes described in this Section 2.2(c) under any circumstances.
(d) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed,
and thereafter no further registration of transfers of Common Shares will be made on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to
have any rights with respect to such Common Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, then they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.
(e) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent’s routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Nonetheless, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority will become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
 
A-4 
Table of Contents
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.
2.3 Dissenting Shares.
(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Common Shares (the “Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted
into any right to receive the Merger Consideration unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal.
From and after the Effective Time, a shareholder who has properly exercised such appraisal rights will not have any rights of a shareholder of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Dissenting Shares, except those provided in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. A
holder of Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by such holder in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal, in
which case the Dissenting Shares will be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with Section 2.2.
(b) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL (including
copies of such demands), attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other communications received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to any demands for appraisal; provided that Parent shall
not have the right to direct the Company to settle any negotiation or Proceeding with respect to any demands for appraisal with effect prior to the
Effective Time. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.
2.4 Company Incentive Plans.
(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option granted by the Company that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and will immediately cease to be outstanding, without any payment with respect to such Company
Option or cancellation thereof except as provided in the following sentence. In full satisfaction of the cancellation of each Company Option described in
the immediately preceding sentence, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and no
later than the second payroll date after the Effective Time), to pay, to the holder of such Company Option (which, for employees of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, shall be in accordance with the general payroll practices of the Surviving Corporation), an amount in cash in respect thereof
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the
number of Common Shares then subject to such Company Option (which number, in the case of Company Options subject to performance goals based on
stock price hurdles, shall be determined based on actual performance in accordance with the terms of such Company Options, with any Company Options
that do not vest being forfeited for no consideration) (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld in accordance with Section 2.5 and
without interest). For the avoidance of doubt, no consideration will be paid with respect to any Company Option that has a per-share exercise price that is
greater than, or equal to, the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, no Person will retain any rights with respect to any previously outstanding
Company Options other than the rights of a holder to receive the payment contemplated by this Section 2.4(a).
(b) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU, other than any Post-Signing Company RSU, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and will
 
A-5 
Table of Contents
immediately cease to be outstanding, without any payment with respect to such Company RSU or cancellation thereof except as provided in the following
sentence. In full satisfaction of the cancellation of each Company RSU described in the immediately preceding sentence, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and no later than the second payroll date after the Effective Time), to pay to
the holder of such Company RSU (which, for employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, shall be in accordance with the general
payroll practices of the Surviving Corporation), an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by
(ii) the number of Common Shares then subject to such Company RSU (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld in accordance with
Section 2.5 and without interest). As of the Effective Time, no Person will retain any rights with respect to any Company RSUs (other than any Post-
Signing Company RSUs) other than the rights of a holder to receive the payment contemplated by this Section 2.4(b).
(c) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU granted after the date hereof that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a “Post-Signing Company RSU”) will be substituted automatically with a Parent cash-based award (each, a “Parent Cash Award”) with
respect to an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of Common Shares then subject to such
Post-Signing Company RSU. Each Parent Cash Award shall otherwise be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to such Post-
Signing Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) As of the Effective Time, each Company PSU, other than any Company Products PSU (each, a “Company Non-Products PSU”), that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, will be cancelled and will immediately cease to be outstanding,
without any payment with respect to such Company Non-Products PSU or cancellation thereof except as provided in the following sentence. In full
satisfaction of the cancellation of each Company Non-Products PSU described in the immediately preceding sentence, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and no later than the second payroll date after the Effective Time), to pay to
the holder of such Company Non-Products PSU (which, for employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, shall be in accordance with
the general payroll practices of the Surviving Corporation), an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration,
multiplied by (ii) the number of Common Shares then subject to such Company Non-Products PSU based on (A) for performance periods that are
complete as of the Effective Time, actual performance as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the Company Board of Directors in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (B) for performance periods that are incomplete as of the Effective Time, the greater of the
target and actual performance as of the fifth trading day prior to the Closing as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the Company
Board of Directors in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (provided that, for purposes of relative TSR metrics, such actual
performance shall be calculated using the Merger Consideration as the Company stock value) (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes
withheld in accordance with Section 2.5 and without interest). As of the Effective Time, no Person will retain any rights with respect to any Company
Non-Products PSU other than the rights of a holder to receive the payment contemplated by this Section 2.4(d).
(e) As of the Effective Time, each Company PSU set forth on Section 2.4(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a “Company Products
PSU”), that is unvested and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be substituted automatically with a Parent Cash Award subject
to the same performance-based vesting requirements (a “Parent Performance Cash Award”) with respect to that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that is equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of Common Shares then subject to such Company
Products PSU. Each Parent Performance Cash Award shall otherwise be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to such
Company PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 
A-6 
Table of Contents
(f) As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans will terminate and all rights under any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the issuance or grant of any other interest with respect to the shares of the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be cancelled. The Company will
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 2.4, including sending any requisite notices, obtaining any necessary
resolutions of the Company Board of Directors or a committee thereof, and obtaining all consents necessary to cash out and cancel, as described in
Section 2.4(a), Section 2.4(b) and Section 2.4(d), all Company Options, Company RSUs (other than Post-Signing Company RSUs) and Company Non-
Products PSUs so as to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Person will have any rights under the Company Stock Plans with respect thereto other
than rights to receive the payments contemplated by Section 2.4(a), Section 2.4(b) or Section 2.4(d). The Company will provide Parent with copies of all
such notices, resolutions and other materials in connection with its obligations prior to Closing for Parent’s reasonable review and comment prior to
distribution.
(g) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Company Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, the administrator of the Company ESPP)
will pass such resolutions and take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that (i) no new offering or new purchase
period will commence following the date hereof unless and until this Agreement is terminated; (ii) from and after the date hereof, no new participants will
be permitted to participate in the Company ESPP and participants will not be permitted to increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from
those in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (iii) each purchase right issued pursuant to the Company ESPP will be fully exercised not later than the
earlier of (A) the last day of the current purchase period or (B) 10 Business Days prior to the Effective Time, and, immediately following such purchases,
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP will terminate.
2.5 Withholding. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to
deduct and withhold, from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable in accordance with this Agreement or any ancillary agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), or any other applicable federal,
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement and any other agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any amounts subject to compensatory withholding and payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this
Agreement will be remitted by the applicable payer to the Company for payment through the Company’s or a Company Subsidiary’s payroll procedures in
accordance with applicable Law.
SECTION 3 - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY
Except (a) as disclosed in the particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter referenced therein (it being understood and agreed
that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter also will apply to each other section and subsection of this
Agreement to which its applicability is reasonably apparent on its face from the text of the disclosure) or (b) other than with respect to Section 3.1,
Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.4 (except to the extent a Company Material Contract was filed as an exhibit to any of the Company SEC Documents) and
Section 3.5, as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by the Company
since January 1, 2020 and at least one Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement (but, in each case, excluding any disclosure contained under the
heading “Risk Factors” or in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other precautionary or other forward-looking statements) and to the
extent publicly available on the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System (“EDGAR”), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:
3.1 Organization; Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company
Subsidiary (i) is a legal

Table of Contents
entity duly organized and validly existing and (ii) in good standing (where such concept is applicable) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, formation or organization, as applicable. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority to
conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently being conducted and to own, lease and operate its properties and assets in the
manner in which its properties and assets are currently owned, leased and operated, in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed has not had, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. True and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended (the
“Certificate of Incorporation”) and the bylaws of the Company, as amended (the “Bylaws”), in each case, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement,
have been made available to Parent and are in full force and effect and the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions thereof. The
organizational or governing documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and none of the Company Subsidiaries is in

Company Stock Plans. Since the close of business on the Capitalization Date, there has been no issuance or grant of any Common Shares, Company
Preferred Shares or any other securities of the Company, other than any issuances of Common Shares or other securities in accordance with the exercise,

Company Option was by its terms to be effective (the “Company Option Grant Date”) by all necessary corporate action. No Company Option has been
granted with a per share exercise price less than the fair market value of a Common Share on the applicable Company Option Grant Date, and the
Company has not granted any Company Options that are subject to Section 409A of the Code. Each grant of a Company Stock Plan Award or right to

awards, including any equity appreciation rights, security-based performance units, “phantom” stock, profit-participation or other security rights issued

Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a

statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.5, none of

statements for external purposes in conformity with GAAP, including policies that provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with management’s general or specific authorizations, (ii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or
specific authorization and (iii) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is

operation of internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the

recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions with respect to required disclosure and to make

5.2 No Solicitation.
(a) The Company will cease and terminate, and will direct its Representatives to cease and terminate, all solicitations, discussions, and
negotiations with any Person with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal as of the date of this Agreement. Except as provided in this Section 5.2,
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company will not and will cause its

understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or similar agreement (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”)

Acquisition

Table of Contents
Proposal, or grant any waiver or release under any restriction from making a Company Acquisition Proposal, in each case, other than discussions solely
to notify such Person of the terms of this Section 5.2 or to clarify the terms and conditions of such proposal or offer. The Company agrees that any
violations of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2 by any of its Representatives will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including this
Section 5.2) by the Company.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
date on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company and its Representatives may furnish non-public information concerning the
Company’s business, properties or assets to any Person in accordance with a confidentiality agreement with terms not materially less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such agreement need not include a standstill
provision) and may participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, such Person
has submitted a bona fide proposal to the Company relating to such Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of Section
5.2(a) and that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors, either constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Shareholders Meeting, the Company
will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent if the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Representative receives (i) any Company
Acquisition Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to a
Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. The
Company will provide Parent promptly (and in any event within such 48-hour period) with the identity of such Person and a correct and complete copy of
such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where such Company Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a description of the
material terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including any modifications thereto. The Company
will keep Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any event no later than 48 hours after the occurrence of any material
changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Company Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the
material terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning
a Company Acquisition Proposal and will in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to
providing such notice. The Company will not, and will cause each Company Subsidiary not to, enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement that would restrict the Company’s ability to provide such information to Parent. The Company (A) will not, and will cause each
Company Subsidiary not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality
agreement to which it or any Company Subsidiary is or becomes a party, and (B) will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, use reasonable best
efforts to enforce any such agreement, in each case, unless the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
of Directors to the Company’s shareholders under applicable Law, in which event the Company may take the actions described in these clauses (A) and
(B) solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a Company Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such third party agreeing that the
Company shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent (including regarding any such Company Acquisition Proposal) in accordance
with, and otherwise complying with, this Section 5.2. The Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company
or any Company Subsidiary provided or made available in accordance with this Section 5.2(b) which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Superior Proposal” is a written Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
Section 5.2(a) (provided, that for this purpose the references to “20%” in the definition of “Company Acquisition Proposal” shall be deemed to be
references to “50%”) on terms (x) which the Company Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment
 
A-40 
Table of Contents
to be more favorable to the holders of the Common Shares than the transactions contemplated hereby (after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, including the likelihood that the
transactions contemplated by such Company Acquisition Proposal or this Agreement will be completed.
(c) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof will (i) make any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (ii) enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any
Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referenced in Section 5.2(b) entered into in the circumstances referenced in
Section 5.2(b)). The Company, promptly following a determination by the Company Board of Directors that a Company Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, will notify Parent of such determination.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.2(c) to the contrary, prior to the date on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if the
Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal and the Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments of
this Agreement that are offered in writing by Parent, the Company Board of Directors may, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of the Common Shares in
accordance with Law, (A) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company will not terminate this Agreement in accordance with clause (B)
above, and any purported termination in accordance with clause (B) above will be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently
with such termination the Company (1) pays the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2 to the extent required thereby and (2) immediately
following such termination enters into a binding definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal; provided, further, that the
Company Board of Directors may not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with clause (A) above or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with clause (B) above unless (I) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in
advance (the “Notice Period”), of its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and has contemporaneously provided a
correct and complete copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, (II) prior to effecting such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, the Company has, and has caused its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent requests to negotiate) regarding any adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and (III) following any negotiation described in clause (II) above, the Company Board of Directors
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal after the start of the Notice Period, the Company is required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.2(d) with respect to such new written notice, and the
Notice Period will be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice, except that the references to four Business Days will be deemed two
Business Days. Any Company Adverse Recommendation Change will not change the approval of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of
causing any state takeover statute or other Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.
(e) The Company Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event
if the Company Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change on account of the Company Intervening Event would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided,
however, that the Company Board of Directors will not make a Company Adverse
 
A-41 
Table of Contents
Recommendation Change unless the Company has (i) provided to Parent at least four Business Days’ prior written notice advising Parent that the
Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail and (ii) during such four-
Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the
need or reason for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
(f) The Company will promptly (but in no event later than three Business Days after the date of this Agreement) request that each Person
that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with a potential Company Acquisition Proposal that remains in effect return (or destroy, to
the extent permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement) all confidential information furnished to such individual or entity by or on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.
(g) Nothing in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement will prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, including
any “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
shareholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law; provided, that this Section 5.2(g) will not be deemed to permit the Company Board of
Directors to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by Section 5.2(d).
5.3 Proxy Statement. The Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event within 25
Business Days, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The Company will notify Parent promptly (and in any case no later
than 24 hours) of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the
Company Requisite Vote there will occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, including correcting
any information that has become false or misleading in any material respect, the Company will promptly prepare and mail to its shareholders such an
amendment or supplement. Parent and its counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC and
the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions, or changes thereto suggested by Parent and its counsel. The Company
will (a) establish a record date, (b) commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith and (c) thereafter
commence mailing the Proxy Statement to the Company’s shareholders as promptly as practicable after (i) the first Business Day after the date that is 10
calendar days after filing the Proxy Statement in preliminary form if, prior to such date, the SEC does not provide comments or indicates that it does not
plan to provide comments or (ii) the date on which the Company shall have been informed by the SEC staff that it has no further comments on the
document. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement will include the Company Board Recommendation.
5.4 Shareholders Meeting. The Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the “Shareholders Meeting”) for the purpose of seeking the Company Requisite Vote and, subject to
Section 5.2, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit approval of this Agreement. The Company will schedule the Shareholders Meeting to be held within
25 Business Days of the initial mailing of the Proxy Statement (or if the Company’s nationally recognized proxy solicitor advises that 25 Business Days
from the date of mailing the Proxy Statement is insufficient time to submit and obtain the Company Requisite Vote, such later date to which Parent
consents (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld)); provided, that, the Company shall be permitted to postpone or
adjourn the Shareholders Meeting, but only (a) if the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its shareholders at such time, to the extent necessary in
order to obtain a quorum of its shareholders,
 
A-42 
Table of Contents
(b) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in Person or represented by proxy at such meeting to obtain the Company Requisite Vote, to allow
reasonable time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, (c) if the Company Board of Directors has determined in
good faith, after consultation with Parent, that such delay is required by applicable Law to comply with comments made by the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement or to allow reasonable time for the mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure required thereby or (d) if the Company is required
to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, further, that: (i) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company may not postpone or
adjourn the Shareholders Meeting by more than 15 calendar days past the originally scheduled date without Parent’s prior consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld), (ii) if applicable, the Company shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to resolve any
SEC comments and (iii) the Company shall reconvene the Shareholders Meeting at the earliest practicable date on which the Company Board of Directors
reasonably expects to have sufficient affirmative votes to adopt this Agreement.
5.5 Merger Sub. Parent will take all actions necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations in accordance with this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
5.6 Rule 16b-3 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable (to the
extent permitted under Law and no-action letters issued by the SEC) to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to
Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
to the extent permitted by Law.
5.7 Director Resignations. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary to execute and deliver a letter effectuating such director’s resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, as a director of the
Company or such Company Subsidiary, as applicable.
SECTION 6 - ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS
6.1 Nasdaq; Post-Closing SEC Reports. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Laws and rules and
policies of Nasdaq to delist the Common Shares from Nasdaq and terminate the registration of the Common Shares under the Exchange Act promptly after
the Effective Time. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to file with the SEC (a) a Form 25 on the Closing Date and
(b) a Form 15 on the first Business Day that is at least 10 days after the date the Form 25 is filed (such period between the Form 25 filing date and the Form
15 filing date, the “Delisting Period”). If the Surviving Corporation is reasonably likely to be required to file any reports in accordance with the Exchange
Act during the Delisting Period, the Company will deliver to Parent at least five Business Days prior to the Closing a substantially final draft of any such
reports reasonably likely to be required to be filed during the Delisting Period (“Post-Closing SEC Reports”). The Post-Closing SEC Reports provided by
the Company in accordance with this Section 6.1 will (i) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
and (ii) comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable Laws.
6.2 Access to Information. Subject to applicable Law, including Antitrust Law, and to reasonable restrictions relating to COVID-19, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, Parent will be entitled, through its
employees and Representatives, to have reasonable access to the assets, properties, business, operations, personnel and
 
A-43 
Table of Contents
Representatives of the Company and each Company Subsidiary solely for the purpose of furthering the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and for integration planning purposes. Any such investigation and examination will be conducted during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice, at Parent’s expense and under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Company, and will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements, except as may otherwise be required or restricted by Law, so as to limit disruption to or impairment of the Company’s business, and the
Company will cooperate fully therein. No investigation by Parent will diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
of the Company contained in this Agreement. The Company will furnish the Representatives of Parent during such period with all such information and
copies of such documents concerning the affairs of the Company as such Representatives may reasonably request and cause its Representatives to
cooperate fully with such Representatives of Parent, in each case, in connection with such purposes. Nothing herein will require the Company to disclose
any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its reasonable discretion and after notice to Parent, (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege (so long as the Company has reasonably cooperated with Parent to disclose such information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with
respect thereto), (ii) contravene any applicable Law or protective order (so long as the Company has used reasonable best efforts to provide such
information in a way that does not contravene applicable Law or such protective order) or (iii) result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third
parties; provided, that information will be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to
external counsel for Parent, to the extent the Company determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable
Antitrust Laws. With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this Section 6.2, Parent will comply with, and will instruct Parent’s Representatives
to comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of termination of this
Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent the information described in Section 6.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no breach by the Company of its obligations under the foregoing sentence shall constitute a breach of
this Agreement by the Company for purposes of Section 7.2(b) or Section 8.1(c)(i).
6.3 Public Disclosure. The initial press release concerning the Merger will be a joint press release and, thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in
effect, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company will disseminate any press release or other public announcement concerning the Merger or this
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national stock
exchange, without the prior consent of each of the other parties hereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Without prior consent of the other parties hereto, each party hereto may disseminate information substantially similar to information included in a press
release or other communication previously approved for public distribution by the other parties hereto. The restrictions of this Section 6.3 will not apply
to communications by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
6.4 Regulatory Filings; Efforts to Consummate.
(a) Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and provided that at all times the
provisions of Section 6.4(b)-(f) shall govern the matters set forth therein, including efforts required to obtain any Regulatory Approval, the Company and
Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations, in each case, necessary or advisable in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date.
(b) Regulatory Approvals. Subject to the terms of this Section 6.4(b) and Section 6.4(d), the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each
other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their
 
A-44 
Table of Contents
respective reasonable best efforts to (x) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement
and the Merger as required by the HSR Act promptly following the date of this Agreement; and (y) file comparable pre-merger or post-merger notification
filings, forms and submissions with any Governmental Authority that are required by other applicable Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment Laws or that
are, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, advisable in connection with the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent, as applicable, shall (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to):
(i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of the filings referenced in this Section 6.4(b);
(ii) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply the other with any information that may be required in order to make such
filings;
(iii) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by
the FTC, the DOJ or the Governmental Authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made;
(iv) use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to (1) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment Laws applicable to the Merger; and (2) obtain any required
consents pursuant to any Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment Laws applicable to the Merger, in each case as soon as practicable, and in any event
prior to the Outside Date;
(v) contest, defend and appeal any legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger; and
(vi) prior to independently participating in any meeting, or engaging in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings or any investigations or other inquiries relating thereto, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide notice to the
other party of such meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate.
Parent shall, after good faith consultation with the Company and after considering, in good faith, the Company’s views and comments, control and
lead all communications, negotiations, timing decisions, and strategy on behalf of the parties relating to any approval under the Antitrust Laws or
Foreign Investment Laws and any litigation matters pertaining to the Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment Laws applicable to the Merger, and the
Company shall take all reasonable actions to support Parent in connection therewith. Each of the Company and Parent will permit the other party and its
Representatives to review in advance any written communication proposed to be made by such party to any Governmental Authority regarding the
Merger and will consider in good faith the views of the other party and promptly inform the other party of any substantive communication from any
Governmental Authority regarding the Merger in connection with such filings. If any party or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws
or Foreign Investment Laws applicable to the Merger, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to be made), as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Parent shall not (i)
withdraw, or offer or commit to withdraw, any filing or notification described in Section 6.4(b)(x) or (y) or (ii) commit to or agree with any Governmental
Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or not consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, in
each case, without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each party will bear its own
costs of preparing its own pre-merger notifications and similar filings and notices in other jurisdictions and related expenses incurred to make or obtain
any approval, clearance or notice under any applicable Antitrust Law (including under the HSR Act), Foreign Investment Law or other applicable Law.
Parent will be responsible for payment of the applicable filing fees associated with any such Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment Laws.

(c) Notwithstanding any other requirement in this Section 6.4, where a party (a “Disclosing Party”) is required under this Section 6.4 to
provide information to another party (a “Receiving Party” ) that the Disclosing Party deems to be competitively sensitive information, the Disclosing
Party may comply with such requirement by restricting the provision of such competitively sensitive only to antitrust counsel of the Receiving Party and
providing to the Receiving Party, upon request of the Receiving Party, a redacted version of such information which does not contain any such
competitively sensitive information.
(d) Regulatory Remedies. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, reasonable best efforts will not obligate Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent to: (i) make any commitment to or undertake or enter into agreements or agree to the entry of an order or decree with any
Governmental Authority, (ii) commit to sell or dispose of, or hold separate or agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or business
of the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent or the Company, (iii) without limiting the express obligations of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent set forth in Section 6.4(b)(i), 6.4(b)(ii), 6.4(b)(iii), 6.4(b)(v) or 6.4(b)(vi), commit to or accept any operational restriction or
take or commit to take any action related to the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent or the Company, (iv)
commit to terminate, amend or replace any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of the Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent or the Company, (v) terminate any relevant venture or other arrangement of the Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent or the Company or (vi) effectuate any other change or restructuring of the Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent or the Company. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any of
the foregoing actions in clauses (i) through (vi) with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company unless consented to in writing by Parent,
provided that the Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary of the Company to, undertake such actions if requested by Parent if the effectiveness
of such action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.
(e) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, neither Parent nor the Company shall engage in, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to
engage in, any merger or acquisition, including any business combinations, asset acquisitions or sales, consolidations, mergers, stock acquisitions or
sales, joint ventures, collaborations, licensing or other strategic transactions, that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
prevent, delay or impair the consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date.
(f) If, prior to the Effective Time (i) the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) indicates in writing to Parent that it has
decided to formally investigate the Merger and, accordingly, requests Parent to submit a merger notice in the form prescribed under the Enterprise Act
2002, (ii) the European Commission (the “EC”) indicates in writing to Parent that a member state of the European Union or the EC is making, or has made, a
referral of the Merger to the EC under Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulation, or (iii) a merger control, foreign direct investment or national security
inquiry or review is initiated or commenced by a Governmental Authority listed on Section 6.4(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, then, Parent shall
provide to the Company a copy of such written indication or filing, form or other submission as promptly as practicable after its receipt or submission
thereof, as applicable, and if such indication or filing, form or other submission shall have been so provided, approval of the Merger by the CMA under
the Enterprise Act of 2002 or the EC under Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulation or such other Governmental Authority under the applicable Law in its
jurisdiction, as the case may be, shall thereupon be deemed to be added to Section 7.1(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter and shall be a Regulatory
Approval.
6.5 Notification of Certain Matters; Litigation. The Company will promptly after it has notice of any of the following, to the extent permitted by Law,
notify Parent of (i) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will promptly notify Parent of any Proceedings instituted or threatened against the Company or any of
its directors, officers or Affiliates, by any holders of the Shares of the Company, before any court or Governmental Authority, relating to this Agreement
or
 
A-46 
Table of Contents
the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or discovery in connection with such transactions (“Transaction Litigation”). The Company
will consult with Parent with respect to the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, will consider Parent’s views with respect to such
Transaction Litigation, and will not settle or materially stipulate with respect to any such Transaction Litigation without Parent’s written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
6.6 Indemnification.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each current or former director and officer of the Company (determined as of the Effective Time), in each
case, when acting in such capacity or in serving as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another entity or enterprise, including a Benefit Plan,
at the request or benefit of the Company (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses),
amounts paid in settlement, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to any
actual or alleged Proceeding, in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to matters existing or occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to or
at the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance reasonable expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (subject to the execution of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined, by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal, that the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.6). In the event of any such actual or alleged Proceeding, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such actual or alleged Proceeding. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses equivalent to the provisions of the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Parties, except to the extent required by applicable Law; provided that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim made for indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of
such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, all
indemnification Contracts described in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such Contracts in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any Indemnified Parties.
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the
Effective Time, to purchase from the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement or one or more
insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as such carrier, a six-year prepaid “tail” policy, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable to the insureds than the coverage provided under the Company’s existing policies of directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the “Existing Policies”), with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement), and Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation; provided that the Company shall not pay,
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay, in excess of the amount set forth in Section 6.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the
Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policies prior to or as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement with the Company’s directors’ and
 
A-47 
Table of Contents
officers’ liability insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement or one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as such carrier
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums
in excess of the amount set forth in Section 6.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as practicable for
such amount.
(c) The covenants contained in this Section 6.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees.
(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set
forth in this Section 6.6, unless such result occurs by operation of Law.
6.7 Employee Benefits.
(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or an earlier termination of the relevant employee’s employment), each employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) will be provided (i) an annual base salary or wage rate and annual target cash bonus opportunity that are, in
each case, no less favorable than the annual base salary or wage rate and annual target cash bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits
(excluding equity compensation, change in control, transaction or retention payments, defined benefit, nonqualified deferred compensation, severance
benefits, post-retirement or retiree medical benefits) that are in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Each Continuing Employee will be
provided severance benefits as set forth on Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(b) As of the Effective Time, all Continuing Employees in the United States (and in any other jurisdiction where permitted by Law) will
become subject to Parent’s vaccine mandate, which requires colleagues to be fully vaccinated and to provide proof of full vaccination or to be granted a
medical or religious accommodation by Parent.
(c) With respect to each applicable benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates, each Continuing Employee who participates in any such plan will
receive service credit for all periods of employment with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility, in each case, in accordance with the terms of such plans, to the same extent and for the same purposes
thereunder as such service was recognized under an analogous Benefit Plan in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that the foregoing will not
apply (i) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service or (ii) for purposes of (x) any
“retirement savings contribution” under any Parent employee plan providing 401(k) plan benefits, (y) any retiree medical plan or defined benefit plan or
(z) any benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or the Surviving Corporation that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee
population, either with respect to level of benefits or participation; provided, further, that the Company has made available to Parent such information as
is reasonably requested by Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.7(c). If, on or after the Effective
 
A-48 
Table of Contents
Time, any Continuing Employee becomes covered by any benefit plan providing medical, dental, health, pharmaceutical or vision benefits (a “Successor
Plan”), other than the plan in which he or she participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Prior Plan”), Parent will (1) cause any restrictions or
limitations with respect to pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible dependents (except to the extent such exclusions or requirements were applicable under the corresponding Prior Plan), and (2) use commercially
reasonable efforts to permit such Continuing Employee to take into account any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the plan year in which the employee elects to be covered by the Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and/or his or her covered dependents for that year, to the extent that such
expenses were incurred during the applicable period in which such employee or covered dependent was covered by a corresponding Prior Plan.
(d) If, no later than seven days prior to the Effective Time, Parent provides written notice to the Company that the Company 401(k) Plan (the
“401(k) Plan”) shall be terminated, the appropriate committee shall take actions necessary to terminate the 401(k) Plan, such termination to be effective as
of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and consistent with Parent’s administrative practices with respect to similarly situated employees in similar acquisitions), offer
participation in Parent’s Tax qualified defined contribution plan (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”) to each Continuing Employee who was an active participant in
the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date of its termination and who satisfies the eligibility requirements of the Parent 401(k) Plan. If the 401(k) Plan is
terminated in accordance with this Section 6.7(d), then (i) Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with an opportunity to make catch-up
contributions with respect to the period between the Closing Date and the date on which Continuing Employees are offered to commence participation in
the Parent 401(k) Plan, subject to any limitations under the Code; and (ii) if elected by such Continuing Employee in accordance with applicable Law,
Parent shall permit the Parent 401(k) Plan to, following the Closing Date, accept a “direct rollover” to such Parent 401(k) Plan of the account balances
(including any participant loans) of such Continuing Employee.
(e) The provisions contained in this Section 6.7 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing in this Section 6.7,
whether express or implied, will create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any other person, including, without limitation, any current or former
employee, director, officer, other service provider, any participant in any Benefit Plan or other benefit plan or arrangement, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment or service, or any term or condition of employment with the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, will be treated as
the establishment of, amendment to, waiver or other modification of any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement, or
arrangement, or will limit the right of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to
amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement, or arrangement in accordance with its
terms.
6.8 Takeover Laws. If any “fair price,” “business combination” or “control share acquisition” statute or other similar statute or regulation is or may
become applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties hereto will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take
such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute or
regulation on such transactions.
6.9 Further Assurances. Other than with respect to antitrust matters which will be governed by Section 6.4, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
 
A-49

the terminating party to the other party hereto and, if then due, payment of the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable. If this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, this Agreement will become null and void and be of no further force or effect and there will be no
liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents or
Representatives), except as set forth in the last sentence of Section 6.2, Section 8 and Section 9, each of which will remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for actual and intentional fraud in

(b) If Parent terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(c)(ii), the Company will promptly pay Parent a fee (the “Termination
Fee”) of $1,646,000,000 in cash, but in no event later than two Business Days after the date of receipt of Parent’s termination notice. If the Company

Termination Fee. If (i) Parent or the Company, as applicable, terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(b)(ii), Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section
8.1(c)(i) and, at the time of such termination, the Company Requisite Vote shall not have been obtained, (ii) prior to such time, a Company Acquisition

months after the date on which this Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal that is ultimately consummated or a Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated (provided that, for purposes of this clause (iii), the
references to “20%” in the definition of “Company Acquisition Proposal” shall be deemed to be references to “50%”), then the Company will pay Parent
the Termination Fee upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Company Acquisition Proposal. All amounts due hereunder will be
payable by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such account as Parent may designate in writing to the Company. If the Company fails to
promptly make any payment required in accordance with this Section 8.2(b), the Company will indemnify Parent for its fees and expenses (including
attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with pursuing such payment and will pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate of
Bank of America (or its successors or assigns) in effect on the date the payment was payable in accordance with this Section 8.2(b). The Company will
not be required to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) more than once. Except in the case of the Company’s actual and intentional
fraud in the making of any of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or Willful Breach by the Company of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, in the event that the Termination Fee is triggered and is paid pursuant to this Section 8.2(b), receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives against the Company and its Affiliates and
Representatives under this Agreement or arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such
amount, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment,
by any legal or equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law or otherwise.

to such termination right is in respect of, pursuant to or arises under any Antitrust Law or Foreign Investment Law, or (ii) Section 8.1(b)(ii), and, in each of
cases (i) and (ii), at the time of such termination, (A) the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) has been satisfied, (B) any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(c) has not been satisfied (and, in the case of Section 7.1(c), the statute, rule,
 
A-53 
Table of Contents
regulation, Order or injunction that has caused Section 7.1(c) to not be satisfied is in respect of, pursuant to or arises under any Antitrust Law or Foreign
Investment Law), (C) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 are satisfied (or, in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, are capable of being satisfied on such date), and (D) a breach by the Company of its obligations in Section 6.4 has not contributed materially and
substantially to the applicable Restraint that gives rise to the termination right pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or the failure of any of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(c) to be satisfied, then Parent will promptly pay or cause to be paid to the Company a fee (the “Reverse Termination Fee”)
of $2,224,000,000 in cash, but in no event later than two Business Days after such termination. All amounts due hereunder will be payable by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to such account as the Company may designate in writing to Parent. If Parent fails to promptly make any payment required
in accordance with this Section 8.2(c), Parent will indemnify the Company for its fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with pursuing such payment and will pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate of Bank of America (or its successors or
assigns) in effect on the date the payment was payable in accordance with this Section 8.2(c). Parent will not be required to pay the Reverse Termination
Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2(c) more than once. Except in the case of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s actual and intentional fraud in the making of any of its
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, in the event that the Reverse Termination Fee is triggered and is paid pursuant to this Section 8.2(c), receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives against Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives under
this Agreement or arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such amount, neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
Proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law or otherwise.
8.3 Fees and Expenses. Except as set forth in Section 6.4, Section 6.6 and Section 8.2, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.
8.4 Amendment. Subject to Law and as otherwise provided in the Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented, by
written agreement of the parties hereto. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.
8.5 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, either party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other party hereto or any conditions to its own obligations, in
each case, only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are intended for its benefit; provided, however, that any such extension or
waiver will be binding upon a party hereto only if such extension or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by such party.

9.4 Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions arising under or in connection therewith will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of any other Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law.
9.5 Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
(a) This Agreement will not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that (i) Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party hereto, any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder (A) to Parent, (B) to Parent and one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent or

and without the consent of any other party hereto, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional Merger Sub
Assignees or Parent Assignees, respectively; provided, however, that in connection with any assignment to any Merger Sub Assignee or Parent
Assignee, Parent and Merger Sub (or the assignor), as applicable, will remain liable for the performance by Parent and Merger Sub (and such assignor, if

signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto, it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart.
9.7 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full
force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The parties hereto will replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement

unenforceable provision.
9.8 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably agrees that any legal action or Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the
other party hereto or its successors or assigns will be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if such court
declines jurisdiction, any other state court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably submits with respect to any action or Proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
 
A-56

such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), or (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that (i) the suit, action or Proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
is not enforceable in or by such courts.
9.9 Service of Process. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in
Section 9.8 in any such action or Proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its
address as specified in or pursuant to Section 9.2. However, the foregoing will not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party
by any other legally available method.

any party hereto. No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any
Law, regulation, holding or ruling of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party

hereby do, waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and any other objections to specific performance of
this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding the parties’ rights to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.11(a), each party may pursue any other remedy
available to it at law or in equity, including monetary damages.
9.12 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay by any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of
any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to,
and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of any other Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law.
7.7. Jurisdiction. Each of the Company, Parent and the Advisor (on behalf of itself and the Stockholders) irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect hereof brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns will be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery in the State of
Delaware and, if such court declines jurisdiction, any other state court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, and each of the Company, Parent and the Advisor (on behalf of itself and the Stockholders) hereby irrevocably submits with respect to any
action or Proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of
the Company, Parent and the Advisor (on behalf of itself and the Stockholders) hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as
a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), or (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that (i) the suit, action or
Proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, is not enforceable in or by such courts.
7.8. Service of Process. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to
in Section 7.7 in any such action or Proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its
address as specified in or pursuant to Section 7.5. However, the foregoing will not limit the right of a Party to effect service of process on any other Party
by any other legally available method.
7.9. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND THE ADVISOR (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE STOCKHOLDERS)
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED DOCUMENT,
OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENT OR ACTION RELATED HERETO OR THERETO. Each Party certifies and
acknowledges that (a) no Representative of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver in the event of a legal action, (b) such Party has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such Party makes this waiver voluntarily,
and (d) such Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 7.9.
7.10. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay by any Party in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of
any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to,
and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

7.11. Documentation and Information. The Advisor shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates (including the Stockholders) not to,
make any public announcement regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law (provided that reasonable notice of any
such disclosure will be provided to Parent, and the Advisor will consider in good faith the reasonable comments of Parent with respect to such disclosure
and otherwise cooperate with Parent in obtaining confidential treatment with respect to such disclosure if requested by Parent at Parent’s sole cost and
expense). The Advisor consents to and authorizes (and hereby agrees that the Stockholders consent and authorize) the publication and disclosure by
Parent and the Company of the Advisor’s and the Stockholders’ identity and holding of the Covered Shares, and the terms of this Agreement (including
the disclosure of this Agreement), in any press release, the Proxy Statement and any other disclosure document required in connection with the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (provided that reasonable notice of any such disclosure will
be provided to the Advisor, and Parent will consider in good faith the reasonable comments of the Advisor with respect to such disclosure), and the
Advisor acknowledges (and hereby agrees that the Stockholders acknowledge) that Parent and the Company may, in their sole discretion, file this
Agreement or a form hereof with the SEC or any other Governmental Authority or securities exchange. The Advisor agrees to promptly give the Company
and Parent any information it may reasonably require for the preparation of any such disclosure documents, and the Advisor agrees to promptly notify
the Company and Parent of any required corrections with respect to any information supplied by the Advisor specifically for use in any such disclosure
document, if and to the extent that any such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
7.12. Further Assurances. The Advisor agrees that it shall, and shall cause the Stockholders to, from time to time, at the reasonable request
of Parent and without further consideration, execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be reasonable required
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
7.13. Stop Transfer Instructions. At all times commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
Expiration Time, in furtherance of this Agreement, the Advisor, on behalf of itself and the Stockholders, hereby authorizes the Company or its counsel to
notify the Company’s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to the Covered Shares (and that this Agreement places limits on the
voting and transfer of the Covered Shares), subject to the provisions hereof and provided that any such stop transfer order and notice will immediately
be withdrawn and terminated by the Company following the Expiration Time; provided, that such stop transfer order will not be applicable to any Transfer
effectuated in compliance with Section 2.1 hereof.
7.14. Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, irreparable harm
would occur that monetary damages could not make whole. It is accordingly agreed that (i) each Party will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement in
any action without the posting of a bond or undertaking and (ii) the Parties will, and hereby do, waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense
of adequacy of a remedy at law and any other objections to specific performance of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the Parties’ rights to specific
performance pursuant to this Section 7.14, each Party may pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, including monetary damages.
7.15. Indemnification. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Advisor and the
Stockholders against any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses), amounts paid in settlement, judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred by any of them in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to any third-party claim, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising from or in connection with the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger.

7.16. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to such subject matter. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to amend, alter or modify, in any respect, any of the provisions of the Merger Agreement.
7.17. Interpretation. Except where stated otherwise in this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement:
(a) “either” and “or” are not exclusive and “include,” “includes” and “including” are not limiting, (b) “hereof,” “hereto,” “hereby,” “herein” and
“hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, (c) “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply
“if,” (d) descriptive headings are inserted for convenience only and do not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement, (e)
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms, (f) references to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns, (g) references to a “Section,” or “Schedule” refer to a Section of, or a Schedule to, this Agreement, (h) references to a
federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall mean such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, and include any rules,
regulations and delegated legislation issued thereunder, and (i) words denoting any gender will be deemed to include all genders and words denoting
natural persons will be deemed to include business entities and vice versa. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Party. No summary of this Agreement
prepared by any Party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or ruling of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. Whenever the final day for
performance of an obligation under this Agreement, falls on a day other than a Business Day, the time period for performance thereof will automatically be
extended to the next day that is a Business Day.
7.18. Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement will not be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law
or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, will confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature by reason of this Agreement.
7.19. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or
degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The Parties will replace such invalid or unenforceable provision
of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid or unenforceable provision.
7.20. Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive
the Effective Time.
7.21. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate without further action by any of the Parties and shall have no further
force or effect as of the Expiration Time; provided that the provisions of Sections 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10, 7.15, 7.17, 7.20 and 7.21 shall survive any
such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination of this Agreement shall not prevent any Party from seeking any remedies (at Law or in
equity) against any other Party for that Party’s breach of any of the terms of this Agreement prior to the date of termination.

electronic scan or electronic transmission in portable document format (.pdf), including (but not limited to) DocuSign, delivered by electronic mail), each

have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to the Covered Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the

The Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the “Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of Seagen Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), of the
$229.00 per Share in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger proposed to be entered
into (the “Agreement”) by and among Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), Aris Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company. The Agreement provides that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the
“Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the “Transaction”), as a result of which the Company will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) all Shares
that are owned by the Company as treasury shares and any Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub, or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent or the Company and (ii) any Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement) (the shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), together with any Shares
held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent, “Excluded Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive $229.00 per Share in cash (the $229.00 per
Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our
services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the execution of the Agreement, which will be paid on December 1, 2023,
and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our
expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and
merchant banking activities. In the past two years, except for our current engagement, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other
services to the Company, and we have not received any compensation from the Company during such period. In the past two years, we
