Date, Time and Place
The special meeting of Company stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) will be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023,
at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time online at https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock of Duck Creek, par value
$0.01 per share (“Duck Creek Common Stock”), including unvested Company RSAs (as defined below), at the close
of business on February 9, 2023, the record date for the Special Meeting (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote
at the Special Meeting for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock you owned at the close of business on the
Record Date.
Purpose
At the Special Meeting, we will ask Company stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on proposals
to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may
become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger (collectively, the
“Special Meeting Proposals”).
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to
be voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and
4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. The presence of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a quorum. As a result, 68,453,220 shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock must be represented by proxy or by stockholders present and entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting to have a quorum. Shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are counted as present if:
•
such shares are present in person at the virtual Special Meeting; or
•
a proxy card has been properly submitted by mail, by telephone or over the Internet with respect to such
shares.
If you submit your proxy card, regardless of whether you abstain from voting on one or more of the Special
Meeting Proposals, your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be counted as present at the Special Meeting for
the purpose of determining a quorum. If your shares are held in “street name,” your shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum if your broker, bank, trust or other nominee
 
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
submits a proxy covering your shares. If you hold your shares in “street name” and do not give any instruction to
your broker, bank, trust or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the Special Meeting, those shares
will not be entitled to vote on any Special Meeting Proposal and will not be counted for purposes of determining a
quorum.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs,
present at the Special Meeting or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Special Meeting, provided
a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not
anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the
purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have
no effect on a particular proposal.
Share Ownership of Duck Creek’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date, Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned, and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,733,584 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, consisting of 2,098,465 shares
of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 1,635,119 unvested Company RSAs, representing approximately 2.7%
of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. We expect that Duck Creek’s directors and executive
officers will beneficially own and be entitled to vote a similar figure at the close of business on the date of the Special
Meeting. Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers have informed Duck Creek that they currently intend to vote
all of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the non-
binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
How You Can Vote
You may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:
1.
by voting over the Internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
2.
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
3.
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
4.
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. To vote during the Special
Meeting, you must do so by logging into https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using
the 16-digit control number included in your proxy materials.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name, you are considered the
stockholder of record with respect to those shares.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other
nominee, then the broker, bank, trust or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to
those shares. However, you are still considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares, and your shares are said
to be held in “street name.” Street name holders generally cannot submit a proxy or vote their shares directly and
must instead instruct the broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares using the methods described
above. Because the proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee does not have
discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your
2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a
voting instruction form with the Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the
other proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a
quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were
given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. We encourage you to authorize your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the
instructions provided on the enclosed voting instruction form to provide your instructions over the Internet, by
telephone or by signing, dating and returning the voting instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided. 
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders to vote electronically. Please submit your
proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If you do not have
access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may alternatively vote by signing, dating and returning the
enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting. If you
properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders will vote your shares as you
have directed.
All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted via the
Internet, by telephone and by mail) received before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or
superseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no
direction is indicated on a proxy card, such shares will be voted by the proxy holders named on the enclosed proxy
card according to the recommendation of Duck Creek’s board of directors (the “Board”) “FOR” both of the Special
Meeting Proposals.

Merger Agreement, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger
Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. These interests include the following:
•
the acceleration and cash out of certain equity-based awards held by Duck Creek’s executive officers and
members of the Board as of the Effective Time;
6TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the entitlement of each of Duck Creek’s executive officers to receive payments and benefits under the
executive officer’s applicable employment agreement in the event of a qualifying termination of employment
(as described in the applicable executive officer’s employment agreement); and
•
the continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the

The receipt of cash by Company stockholders in exchange for shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in the
Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. Holders (as defined under the section entitled, “The Merger-U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by a Company

difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock surrendered in the Merger. Backup withholding may
also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder complies with certification
procedures under the backup withholding rules.
Company stockholders that are Non-U.S. Holders (as defined under the section entitled, “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with
respect to the exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has
certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to the backup withholding rules described above unless
the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from
backup withholding.

On February 17, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, captioned O’Dell v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-

February 22, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Karthik Reddiar v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01449 (referred to as the “Reddiar Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On
February 22, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Tim Dangerfield v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01483 (referred to as the “Dangerfield Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
On February 23, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, captioned Kimberly Powell v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-
cv-01526 (referred to as the “Powell Complaint” and together with the O’Dell Complaint, the Reddiar Complaint and
the Dangerfield Complaint, the “Complaints”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
The Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and also that the Board breached its fiduciary duties. Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege
that the proxy statement filed by Duck Creek with the SEC on February 16, 2023, in connection with the Merger
(referred to as the “Preliminary Proxy Statement”) contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and
information concerning the Company’s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and
Evercore in support of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into
between Duck Creek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek
and potential conflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the
Complaints includes enjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain
allegedly material information, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the
terms thereof, granting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to disseminate a proxy statement that does not
contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required or necessary material facts, directing the
defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, declaring
that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees and expenses.
Duck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend
to defend against the Complaints; however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be
required to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.
The outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with
the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the
Merger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered
enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation
of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from
being consummated within the expected time frame.

Company is subject to customary “no-shop” restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative Acquisition Proposals
from third parties and to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third
parties regarding any alternative Acquisition Proposals, subject to a customary “fiduciary out” provision that allows
the Company, under certain specified circumstances, to provide information to, and participate in discussions and
engage in negotiations with, third parties with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if the Special Committee determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such alternative Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the failure to take
such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.

outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if, in each case, the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and subject to additional requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement,
including, in certain circumstances, payment of the Company Termination Fee.

If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Company stockholders and beneficial owners who
continuously hold shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection
with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Company stockholders and beneficial owners may
be entitled to have their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”), and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of
Chancery, as described further below. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights.
Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their
shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of
the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, Company stockholders or beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock must: (1)
deliver a written demand for appraisal to Duck Creek before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (3)
continue to hold or beneficially own, as applicable, their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective
Time; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to
follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the
Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Duck Creek Common Stock unless certain stock
ownership conditions are satisfied by the stockholders and beneficial owners seeking appraisal. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights”
beginning on page 106 of this Proxy Statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the
relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the
applicable statutory provisions are accessible, without subscription or cost, at the

shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you may make a written demand for appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the conditions set forth
above and your written demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which demand is
made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or
securities account statement containing such information or a letter from a broker or other record holder of such
shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of
what it purports to be, and provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving

The following questions and answers are intended to address some commonly asked questions regarding the
Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions
that may be important to you as a Company stockholder. You are encouraged to read carefully the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement and the documents we
refer to in this Proxy Statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement
without charge by following the instructions in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 112 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On January 8, 2023, Duck Creek entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub
with and into Duck Creek, with Duck Creek surviving the Merger as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the
Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Board is furnishing this Proxy
Statement and form of proxy card to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in connection with the solicitation
of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the other proposal to be
voted on at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This Proxy Statement includes
information that we are required to provide to you under the SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting
on the matters presented at the Special Meeting. Company stockholders of record as of the Record Date may
attend the Special Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the Special Meeting Proposals.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time online at
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Duck Creek?
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Duck Creek by Parent through the Merger of Merger Sub with and
into Duck Creek pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved
by the requisite number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, and the other closing conditions under the
Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Duck Creek, with Duck
Creek continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek
expects to delist the Duck Creek Common Stock from Nasdaq and de-register the Duck Creek Common Stock
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Duck Creek would no longer
be a publicly traded company, and Duck Creek will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of
Duck Creek Common Stock.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
Upon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $19.00 in
cash, without interest, for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock that you own, unless you have properly
exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For
example, if you own one hundred (100) shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, you will be entitled to receive
$1,900.00 in cash, without interest, in exchange for your one hundred (100) shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
In either case, your shares will be canceled and you will not own nor be entitled to acquire shares in the
Surviving Corporation or Parent.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023, are entitled to notice of
the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals
 
13TABLE OF CONTENTS
are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to
vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name are
described under the question “How may I vote?” below.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
For Company stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the Special Meeting and are a stockholder of
record, you may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:
•
by voting over the Internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not
instruct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special
Meeting Proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have
discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a voting
instruction form with this Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to
the other proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to
which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. We encourage you to
authorize your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting
Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form.
If you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting and vote by ballot, you are encouraged to vote your shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid legal proxy to
vote shares which you beneficially own and wish to change your vote, you may still vote your shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend
the Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be
counted.
Q:
How many votes do I have?
A:
Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs, is entitled to cast one vote on
each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock, including
each unvested Company RSA, that such holder owned as of the Record Date.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A:
Duck Creek will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual meeting format only on the virtual meeting website. You will
not be able to attend the Special Meeting physically in person. Once admitted to the Special Meeting,
stockholders may vote their shares and view a list of stockholders by following the instructions available on the
meeting website. To vote during the Special Meeting, you must do so by logging into
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using the 16-digit control number included in your
proxy materials.
We recommend that you submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card, or by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope
provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format. We encourage all stockholders to
vote electronically. If you properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders
will vote your shares as you have directed. If you attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by
virtual ballot, your vote by virtual ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
you hold your shares in street name, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting in a virtual format unless you request and obtain a valid legal
proxy from your bank, broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
•
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Duck Creek Common Stock prior to the
announcement of the Merger?
A:
The Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock represents a premium of:
•
approximately 46% over the closing stock price on January 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the
announcement of the Merger Agreement; and
•
approximately 64% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
for the thirty (30) days ended January 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the
Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Duck Creek encourages you to read the accompanying Proxy Statement, including all documents incorporated
by reference into the accompanying Proxy Statement, and its annexes carefully and in their entirety. Then as
promptly as possible, follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card to submit your proxy electronically
over the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. We encourage all
stockholders to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a touch-tone phone or the
Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. If your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has
enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. Please do not send your stock certificate(s) with
your proxy card. See “How may I vote?” in this section of this Proxy Statement for more information.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
On January 8, 2023, the Board, after considering various factors, including the unanimous recommendation
of the Special Committee and the other factors described in the section entitled “The Merger-
Recommendation and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 48 of this Proxy Statement, and after
consultation with Duck Creek’s independent legal and financial advisors, (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement
and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) declared it
advisable and approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, approved the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth therein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby approving
the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby and “FOR” the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now?
A:
No. If you are a record holder, after the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you
will receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificate(s) to the paying agent in
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
order to receive the cash payment of the Merger Consideration for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock
represented by such stock certificate(s). You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock
certificates for the Merger Consideration to which you are entitled upon the consummation of the Merger. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” please contact your broker, bank, trust or other nominee for instructions as to
how to effect the surrender of your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Please do not send in your stock
certificates now.
Q:
If I do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the Closing will include the
procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate(s). This will include an affidavit that
you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to post a bond as
indemnity against any potential loss.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Company stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any
other reason, Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Instead, Duck Creek will remain an independent public company, Duck Creek Common Stock will continue to be
listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports
with the SEC on account of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Under certain specified circumstances, Duck Creek may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee
upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger
Agreement-Company Termination Fee” beginning on page 100 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Do any of Duck Creek’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ
from those of Company stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company stockholders generally. The Board was aware
of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. For a
description of the interests of Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger” beginning
on page 72 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for Duck Creek’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
Under SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger, commonly referred to as “golden parachute” compensation. If the Merger Agreement is approved and
adopted by the Company stockholders and the Merger is completed, this compensation may be paid to the
Company’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and
arrangements even if the Company stockholders fail to approve this proposal.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company
RSAs, present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon at the Special
Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a
 
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck
Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company
stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will
not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there
were 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special
Meeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested
Company RSAs. Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock owned by such holder as of the Record Date.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
“stockholder of record.” In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you
by Duck Creek. As the stockholder of record you have the right to vote by proxy, which involves granting your
voting rights directly to Duck Creek or to a third party, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner
of those shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares.
Without your voting instructions, because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your
broker, bank, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the Special Meeting Proposals.
However, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other
nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those
shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special
Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and will
not be voted with respect to any other proposal.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special
Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated Michael A. Jackowski and Kevin
Rhodes, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.
Q:
Can I change or revoke my proxy?
A:
You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you
attend the Special Meeting, by voting by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following
ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by Internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Christopher Stone, Duck Creek’s Secretary, at Duck Creek’s
mailing address on the first page of this Proxy Statement before the Special Meeting, which states that you
have revoked your proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special
Meeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote
by virtual ballot at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.
Your latest dated proxy card, Internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your voting
instructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
If a Company stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will
or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. However,
if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee
with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those shares will be
voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given and will not be voted with
respect to any other proposal.
Q:
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
A:
The presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting constitutes a quorum. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 136,906,439
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of
132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. If you
submit a properly executed proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In
addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be
counted for purposes of establishing a quorum; however, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting
instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, then those shares
will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting. As
a result, 68,453,220 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a quorum. If a quorum is not present,
the holders of a majority in voting power of the Duck Creek Common Stock, present or represented by proxy, and
entitled to vote thereon, or the chairman of the Special Meeting, may adjourn the Special Meeting pursuant to
Duck Creek’s bylaws.
Q:
How can I obtain a proxy card?
A:
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.
For Company stockholders of record: Please call Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 717-3923 (toll-free from
the U.S. and Canada) or +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other locations).
For holders in “street name”: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar
institution.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be
consummated. If you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of
18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock and each of you notifies Duck Creek in writing of such special arrangements, you
will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom
you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares
at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the
close of business on the Record Date, you are encouraged to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy
card or vote via the Internet or telephone.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and
multiple proxy cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote via the Internet or telephone (or complete, date, sign and return) with respect to each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the
Effective Time?
A:
If you transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the Effective Time,
you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present.
Q:
Who will solicit votes for and bear the cost and expenses of this proxy solicitation?
A:
The cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by Duck Creek. Our directors, officers and employees may solicit
proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. We will pay these
directors, officers and employees no additional compensation for these services. We will reimburse banks,
brokers and other nominees for their reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding this Proxy
Statement and related materials to, and obtaining instructions relating to such materials from, beneficial owners
of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) as its proxy
solicitor. Innisfree will solicit proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic
means. Under our agreement with Innisfree, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Innisfree will receive an
estimated fee not to exceed $45,000 plus reimbursement of its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses for its services
and plus fees for calls (if any) to Company stockholders. In addition, Innisfree and certain related persons will be
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the engagement.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
Duck Creek has retained Broadridge to serve as independent inspector of elections in connection with the
Special Meeting. Duck Creek intends to notify Company stockholders of the results of the Special Meeting by
issuing a press release, which it will also file with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash
pursuant to the Merger?
A:
The exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Statement) who exchanges shares of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to
such shares and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in
the section entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77
of this Proxy Statement), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have
certain connections with the United States.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
What will the holders of outstanding Duck Creek equity awards receive in the Merger?
At the Effective Time, each Company RSA, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSA,
multiplied by (B) $19.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to each Company RSA
granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same terms and
conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSA prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date.
At the Effective Time, each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSU,
multiplied by (B) $19.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to each Company RSU that
was granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same terms and
conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSU prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date.
At the Effective Time, each Company Phantom Stock Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock measured by
reference to such Company Phantom Stock Award, multiplied by (B) $19.00.
At the Effective Time, each Company Option and Company SAR will be cancelled immediately upon the
Effective Time without payment or consideration.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be consummated?
A:
Duck Creek and Parent are working toward consummating the Merger as quickly as possible. Assuming the
timely receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement) of other closing conditions, including approval by Duck Creek’s stockholders of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the first half of
2023.
Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. See the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 22 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his, her or its
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Company stockholders and beneficial
owners are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of
the “fair value” of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
based to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery.
Stockholders and beneficial owners who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in the section entitled
“Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 106 of this Proxy Statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section
262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL
is accessible, without subscription or cost, at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and incorporated by reference herein to this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
What if during the check-in time or during the Special Meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble
accessing the virtual meeting website?
A:
If Duck Creek experiences technical difficulties during the Special Meeting (e.g., a temporary or prolonged power
outage), it will determine whether the Special Meeting can be promptly reconvened (if the technical difficulty is
temporary) or whether the Special Meeting will need to be reconvened on a later day (if the technical difficulty is
more prolonged). In any such situation, Duck Creek will promptly notify stockholders of the decision via the
virtual meeting website.
Technical support will be ready to assist you with any individual technical difficulties you may have accessing
the virtual meeting website. Contact information for technical support will appear on the virtual meeting login
page prior to the start of the Special Meeting.

"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Proxy Statement, and the documents to which Duck Creek refers you in this Proxy Statement, as well as
information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by Duck Creek or on Duck
Creek’s behalf, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including but
not limited to, those statements related to the Merger, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected
timing, completion and effects of the Merger. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as “expect,” “believe,” “target,” “project,” “goals,” “estimate,” “potential,” “predict,” “may,” “will,”
“might,” “could,” “forecast,” “outlook” and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar
expressions. Forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the Merger, are based on the Company’s
current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to
inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future
performance.
Important factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans,
estimates or expectations include but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the Merger on the anticipated terms and
timing, including obtaining required stockholder and regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other conditions to
the completion of the Merger; (ii) potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the
Company or its directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto; (iii) the risk that
disruptions from the Merger (including the ability of certain customers to terminate or amend contracts upon a
change of control) will harm the Company’s business, including current plans and operations, including during the
pendency of the Merger; (iv) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel; (v) potential adverse
reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger; (vi)
legislative, regulatory and economic developments; (vii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing
business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger that could affect the Company’s financial performance;
(viii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact the Company’s ability to pursue certain
business opportunities or strategic transactions; (ix) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including
but not limited to, acts of terrorism, outbreaks of war or hostilities or the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as
management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors; (x) the possibility that the Merger may be more
expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; (xi) the occurrence of
any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger, including in
circumstances requiring the Company to pay a termination fee; (xii) those risks and uncertainties set forth under the
headings “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by
other reports filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time, which are available via the SEC’s website at
www.sec.gov; and (xiii) the risks described in the Proxy Statement.
There can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close within the
anticipated time period. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with
the other forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements relate only to events as of the date on which
the statements are made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-
looking statement except as required by law, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to
be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from what we may have expressed or implied by these forward-
looking statements.
We caution that you should not place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. You should
specifically consider the factors identified in this communication that could cause actual results to differ.
Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or
how they may affect the Company.

Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023 are entitled to notice of
the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. A list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection in Duck Creek’s headquarters
located at 22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10, Boston, MA 02210, during regular business hours for a period of at least
ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and at the location of the Special Meeting during the Special Meeting. To
access the list during the Special Meeting, please use the virtual meeting website link set forth above.
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present. The presence of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a
quorum. Shares that abstain from voting on any proposal will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
With respect to shares held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee generally has the
discretionary authority to vote uninstructed shares on “routine” matters, but cannot vote such uninstructed shares
on “non-routine” matters. Because the Special Meeting Proposals presented to Company stockholders are
considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will
not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special
Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs,
present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, at the Special Meeting,
provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transaction contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company stockholders will be considered non-discretionary,
we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present
for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will
have no effect on a particular proposal. However, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions

will not be voted with respect to any other proposal.",33,34

As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date, Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned, and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,733,584 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, consisting of 2,098,465 shares
of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 1,635,119 unvested Company RSAs, representing approximately 2.7%
of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. We expect that Duck Creek’s directors and executive
officers will beneficially own and be entitled to vote a similar figure at the close of business on the date of the Special
Meeting. The directors and executive officers have informed Duck Creek that they currently intend to vote all of their
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock and “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and “FOR” the non-

If your shares are registered in your name with Duck Creek’s transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you may cause your shares to be voted by submitting electronically over the Internet or by phone a
proxy authorizing the voting of your shares by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the
enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically
over the Internet or by telephone. We encourage all stockholders to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not
have access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
postage-paid envelope provided. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will
vote your shares according to your directions.
If you plan to attend and desire to vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, you will be provided with a
virtual ballot at the Special Meeting. Please note that if your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held of record
by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, and you decide to attend and vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual
format, your vote by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting will not be effective unless you present a legal proxy, issued
in your name from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we
encourage you to submit your proxy to vote your shares in advance of the Special Meeting.
Voting instructions are included on your enclosed proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed
proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the
instructions of the Company stockholders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be
voted “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory
vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. No proxy that is specifically marked against adoption of the Merger Agreement will be voted in
favor of the proposed compensation arrangements for Duck Creek’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger, unless it is specifically marked “FOR” the approval of such proposal.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-
routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your
shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your
broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage
you to authorize your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting
Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form. If you do not vote via the Internet
or telephone through your broker, bank, trust or other nominee or do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other
nominee’s voting form, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote with a proxy from your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee, it will be counted as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not
have any effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in
street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the
proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal,

proxies will allow Company stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to
their use at the Special Meeting which was adjourned, recessed or postponed.
Adjournments
If a quorum is not present or if there are not sufficient votes for the approval of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, Duck Creek expects that the Special Meeting will be adjourned by the chairman of the Special
Meeting pursuant to Duck Creek’s bylaws to solicit additional proxies in accordance with the Merger Agreement. At
any subsequent reconvening of the Special Meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the manner in
which such proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the Special Meeting, except for any proxies
that have been validly revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent meeting.
If the Special Meeting is adjourned, we are not required to give notice of the time and place of the adjourned
meeting if announced at the Special Meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days or the Board fixes a new record date for the Special Meeting. At any adjourned meeting, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original Special Meeting.
Technical Difficulties or Trouble Accessing the Virtual Meeting Website

outage), it will determine whether the Special Meeting can be promptly reconvened (if the technical difficulty is
temporary) or whether the Special Meeting will need to be reconvened on a later day (if the technical difficulty is
more prolonged). In any such situation, Duck Creek will promptly notify stockholders of the decision via the virtual

The Board and the Company’s senior management periodically review the Company’s long-term strategic plan
with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. As part of these ongoing evaluations, the Board and the Company’s
senior management have, from time to time, considered various strategic alternatives, including the continued
execution of the Company’s strategy as a stand-alone public company or the possible sale of the Company to, or
combination of the Company with, a third party.

potential interest of PE Firm A and Company A in exploring a strategic transaction with the Company. No terms of a
potential transaction were discussed.
On August 30, 2022, Mr. Jackowski met with the chief executive officer of Company A via video conference. The
meeting consisted of an introduction between Mr. Jackowski and the chief executive officer of Company A and a
high-level acknowledgment between them that the two companies could be interested in exploring a potential
strategic transaction. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
On September 21, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, met in
person with representatives of PE Firm B, and attended a dinner together following their meeting. The discussions at
the meeting and at the dinner were introductory in nature. The parties discussed on a high level PE Firm B’s potential
interest in exploring a strategic transaction involving the Company. No terms of a potential transaction were
discussed.
On September 22, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met in person with the chief executive officer, chief
financial officer and chief products officer of Company A and representatives of PE Firm A. The discussions at the
meeting were preliminary in nature. The parties discussed on a high level the possibility of a strategic transaction
involving the Company, PE Firm A and Company A. The representatives at the meeting also discussed, at a high
level, certain changes the Company could implement in its expenditures, including its investment in new products, if
it ceased to be a public company. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
As a follow-up to the meeting between Mr. Jackowski and a representative of PE Firm C on August 17, 2022, a

On October 3, 2022, the Board held a meeting with all members of the Board and representatives of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), the Company’s outside legal counsel, in attendance. At the meeting,
Mr. Wright updated the Board on the indications of interest that had been received from PE Firm A, PE Firm B and PE
Firm C in exploring a potential transaction with the Company. Mr. Jackowski updated the Board on the meetings Mr.
Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes held with representatives of PE Firm B on September 21, 2022, with PE Firm A and
Company A on September 22, 2022, and with PE Firm C on September 26, 2022 and on September 27, 2022. Mr.
Jackowski informed the Board that no non-public information had been shared with such parties and that there had
not been any discussion with any party about the Company’s valuation, the price or terms of any potential
transaction, or the potential role of the Company’s current management after a potential transaction.
During the meeting, Mr. Wright stated that Apax would be supportive of a potential sale of the Company, if it
were on attractive terms. Mr. Nicoll, a member of the Board and a managing director of Accenture plc (“Accenture
plc”), stated that Accenture plc would be supportive of exploring potential third-party interest in the Company. The
Board determined that it was supportive of conducting further discussions and explorations of third-party interest in
the Company. The Board determined to establish an ad hoc transaction committee of the Board (the “Transaction
Committee”) to work with management in exploring potential interest in a strategic transaction involving the
Company. The Board appointed Mr. Bloom, Mr. Nicoll and Mr. Wright to the Transaction Committee based on their
experience with respect to strategic transactions and their availability. The Board did not delegate any decision-
making authority to the Transaction Committee. During the meeting, representatives of Skadden reviewed with the
Board its fiduciary duties in the event the Board were to pursue a change in control transaction.
During the same meeting, the Board discussed whether to engage a financial advisor to assist Company
management and the Board in identifying other parties that might have interest in a strategic transaction involving
the Company. The Board considered the Company’s existing investment banking relationships and the qualifications
of those investment banks. The Board authorized the Company’s management and the Transaction Committee to
contact J.P. Morgan for assistance with the exploratory process for a strategic transaction, based on J.P. Morgan’s
qualifications and experience advising, and familiarity with, companies operating in the same industry as the
Company.
At this meeting, Company management updated the Board on the status of management’s preparation of a long-
range plan for the Company. The Board discussed with management the assumptions to be included in a long-range
plan, including with respect to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth rates. The Board authorized management to
engage an internationally recognized consulting firm with expertise in the Company’s industry to assist Company
management in further developing the assumptions which would serve as the basis for the Company’s long-range
plan.
Later, on October 3, 2022, at the request of the Board, Mr. Wright contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to
discuss the potential engagement of J.P. Morgan by the Company in connection with the Company’s evaluation of a
potential strategic transaction. Mr. Wright informed the J.P. Morgan representatives that the Company had received
unsolicited indications of interest from PE Firm A, PE Firm B and, PE Firm C. Mr. Wright requested that J.P. Morgan
identify additional strategic parties and financial parties that the Company could consider contacting to solicit
indications of interest for a strategic transaction involving the Company.
On October 6, 2022, Mr. Jackowski held a meeting with representatives of Vista, during which they discussed the
insurance software industry generally, and potential opportunities for Vista and the Company to work together. No
terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
On October 11, 2022, Mr. Wright held a meeting with a representative of another private equity firm (“PE Firm D”)
on matters not related to the Company, during which they briefly discussed the Company generally and PE Firm D’s
potential interest in exploring a strategic transaction involving the Company. No terms of a potential transaction were
discussed.

On October 18, 2022, at the request of Vista, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met with two representatives from
Vista. Mr. Jackowski and the Vista representatives met in person, and Mr. Rhodes joined the meeting via
videoconference. The parties discussed on a high-level Vista’s interest in exploring a potential strategic transaction
involving the Company. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
On October 27, 2022, Vista submitted an oral, non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a strategic
transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary offer price of $15.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in
cash.
Between October 3, 2022 and November 30, 2022, J.P. Morgan, together with members of the Transaction
Committee and Company management, identified strategic parties and financial parties that the Company could
consider contacting to solicit indications of interest for a strategic transaction involving the Company. The
Transaction Committee directed J.P. Morgan to contact approximately 17 strategic and financial parties, including
Vista, PE Firm A, Company A, PE Firm B, PE Firm C and PE Firm D, to assess (or follow up on, in the case of potential
counterparties who had already been in contact with the Company) their interest in exploring a potential strategic
transaction involving the Company. During that period, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes also met with a number of
those potential counterparties to discuss at a high level the Company’s business and, on a preliminary and high-level
basis, the party’s interest in a potential transaction involving the Company. In those initial meetings, no non-public
information regarding the Company was shared and no terms of any potential transaction were discussed. These
initial meetings included a meeting on October 18, 2022 among Mr. Jackowski, Mr. Rhodes and representatives of
Vista, and a meeting on November 4, 2022 between Mr. Jackowski and a representative of Vista. In addition, on
October 26, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met with investment professionals from Vista at an investor
conference, which was unrelated to any potential transaction, and no potential transaction was discussed.
On November 2, 2022, the chief executive officer of another strategic party (“Company B”), which was among
the parties contacted by J.P. Morgan after the Board meeting on October 3, 2022, contacted J.P. Morgan to request a
management presentation from the Company and requested that Company B be sent a draft confidentiality
agreement. The Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Company B on November 8, 2022, which
included customary standstill provisions (which standstill terminated, in accordance with its terms, upon the
Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement).
On November 14, 2022, Mr. Wright met with representatives of PE Firm A to discuss, on a preliminary basis, a
potential strategic transaction among the Company, PE Firm A and Company A. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also
attended this meeting on behalf of the Company. During the course of the meeting, representatives of PE Firm A
presented various preliminary and high-level financial data generated by PE Firm A regarding a potential strategic
transaction, including PE Firm A’s suggestion that a combination of the Company with Company A could potentially
result in meaningful synergies. PE Firm A’s presentation posited an illustrative offer price of $15.00 per share of Duck
Creek Common Stock, in cash. The parties present at the meeting did not discuss PE Firm A’s preliminary views in
detail; however, Mr. Wright and the J.P. Morgan representatives informed PE Firm A that although the Board had not
previously discussed any potential offer price, it was their expectation that an offer price would need to be
significantly higher than $15.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock in order for the Board to consider a sale of
the Company. The parties present at the meeting discussed at a high level, among other things, that, if the Company
and Company A were to combine, they would together be able to make larger investments in product development.
No other terms of any potential transaction, business plans or financial or other analyses or proposals were
discussed.
On November 16, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met in person with representatives of PE Firm C. During
the meeting, representatives of PE Firm C informed Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes that PE Firm C was not interested
in pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company at this time, but could be interested in providing funding to a
potential acquirer of the Company if such an opportunity were to arise in the future.
In the afternoon of November 16, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met in person with representatives of
Company B. At the meeting, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes presented an overview of certain publicly available
information about the Company and its business, and the parties present at the meeting discussed the insurance
software industry generally.
On November 18, 2022, representatives of another private equity firm (“PE Firm E”) met with Mr. Jackowski and
Mr. Rhodes to discuss PE Firm E’s preliminary interest in a strategic transaction involving the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 21, 2022, Mr. Jackowski, Mr. Rhodes and representatives of J.P. Morgan, and on November 22,
2022, Mr. Rhodes and representatives of J.P. Morgan, held additional financial and technology due diligence sessions
with representatives of Company B.
On November 22, 2022, PE Firm A submitted a non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a strategic
transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary indicative offer price range of $16.25-$16.50 per share of Duck
Creek Common Stock, in cash. PE Firm A’s indication of interest stated that the transaction, if completed, would be
structured as an acquisition of the Company by Company A.
On November 28, 2022, PE Firm D and another private equity firm (“PE Firm F”), which had been contacted as
part of J.P. Morgan’s outreach to potential counterparties after the October 3, 2022 meeting of the Board, informed
representatives of J.P. Morgan verbally of their preliminary interest in jointly pursuing a strategic transaction with the
Company, together with one of their shared portfolio companies, and provided J.P. Morgan with a non-binding,
preliminary offer price range of $14.00-$16.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash.
On November 30, 2022, another private equity firm (“PE Firm G”) submitted a non-binding, preliminary indication
of interest for a strategic transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary indicative offer price range of $14.00-
$16.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash.
On November 30, 2022, PE Firm E informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that PE Firm E intended to submit a
non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a strategic transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary
indicative offer price range of $15.00-$18.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash, and that PE Firm E
would submit a written letter to the Company with its proposal following the meeting of its internal investment
committee to approve the proposal. On December 4, 2022, PE Firm E submitted this proposal in writing.
On November 30, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting with all members of the Transaction Committee
and with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Skadden in attendance. At the meeting, J.P. Morgan representatives
updated the Transaction Committee on the status of the outreaches to potential counterparties and the non-binding
indications of interest that had been received to date. During the meeting, Mr. Wright informed the Transaction
Committee that, subject to Apax’s investment committee’s approval, a different Apax fund than the fund owning
Duck Creek Common Stock might be interested in investing in the buyer group for a strategic transaction involving
the Company if the Board determined to pursue a sale of the Company to PE Firm A and Company A (but would not
be interested in investing in a buyer group with any other potential counterparty), which interest was new and
therefore had not previously been raised with the Transaction Committee or the Board. Mr. Wright further informed
the Transaction Committee that PE Firm A was not yet aware of such Apax fund’s potential interest and that there had
not been any discussions between Apax and PE Firm A regarding the potential participation of an Apax fund as an
investor in such a transaction. Mr. Wright further informed the other members of the Transaction Committee that
Apax’s investment committee was scheduled to discuss the matter on December 5, 2022, and that Mr. Wright would
update the full Board on Apax’s decision, so that the Board could, if appropriate, determine to implement any
appropriate decision-making procedures (including the potential recusal of Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie, the Apax-
nominated directors on the Board, from a strategic alternatives review process). During the meeting, Skadden
representatives reviewed with the Transaction Committee the fiduciary duties of directors when considering a change
in control transaction, recent trends in regulatory review of mergers and acquisitions, and procedural protections the
Board could consider if certain directors had interests in a potential transaction that differed from the interests of the
Company’s other stockholders.
On December 1, 2022, the Board held a meeting with all members of the Board, except Mr. Rajasekar, and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Skadden in attendance. During the meeting, J.P. Morgan representatives updated
the Board on the status of the outreaches to potential counterparties and the non-binding indications of interest that
had been received to date. During the meeting, Skadden representatives also reviewed with the Board the fiduciary
duties of directors in considering a change in control transaction, procedural protections the Board could consider in
the event that certain directors had an interest in a transaction that differed from the interests of the Company’s other
stockholders, and how the Board should evaluate closing uncertainty and regulatory risk in determining the value to
Company stockholders of any proposal. During the meeting, the Board instructed Mr. Jackowski to, and to cause
management to, refrain from engaging in any discussions with potential counterparties with respect to any post-
closing employment or equity participation, none of which had occurred to date. Mr. Wright informed the Board that,
subject to Apax’s investment committee’s approval, a

different Apax fund than the fund owning Duck Creek Common Stock may potentially be interested in investing in
the buyer group for a strategic transaction involving the Company if the Board determined to pursue a sale to PE Firm
A and Company A (but would not be interested in investing in a buyer group with any other potential counterparty),
and that Mr. Wright would update the Board following a meeting of Apax’s investment committee on December 5,
2022 to discuss the matter, so that the Board could, if appropriate, determine to implement appropriate decision-
making procedures (including the potential recusal of Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie, the Apax-nominated directors
on the Board, from a strategic alternatives process).
At this meeting, Mr. Jackowski also updated the Board on the continuing work by Company management to use
the draft long-range plan to develop the Stand-Alone Projections (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-",40,78
"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",Forecasts,"Forecasts
In connection with Duck Creek’s review of strategic alternatives, Duck Creek management prepared unaudited
forecasted financial information of Duck Creek for fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027 (the “Stand-Alone
Projections”), which were reviewed by the Board, subsequently approved by the Board on December 5, 2022, and
then used by the Board in connection with its review of strategic alternatives. The Stand-Alone Projections were
made available to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction, including Vista, in connection with their due
diligence review of a potential transaction. The Stand-Alone Projections were prepared from October through early
December 2022 and the Board approved the Stand-Alone Projections on December 5, 2022.
This Proxy Statement contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
•
Adjusted EBITDA (or Adj. EBITDA), which is defined as net income/loss before interest income/expense
(net), other income/expense (net), provision for income taxes, depreciation of property and equipment,
amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of
contingent consideration and acquisition-related expenses; the Company’s actual Adjusted EBITDA for
the first fiscal quarter of 2023 is calculated before severance costs relating to a reduction in force during
that quarter;
•
Non-GAAP Gross Margin, which is defined as GAAP gross margin before share-based compensation
expense, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized internal-use software that is
included in cost of revenue;
•
Non-GAAP Income from Operations, which is defined as GAAP income/loss from operations before share-
based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of capitalized internal-use
software that is included in cost of revenue, the change in fair value of contingent consideration and
acquisition-related expenses;
•
Unlevered Free Cash Flow pre-NOLs, which is defined as Non-GAAP Income from Operations less share-
based compensation expense, less estimated cash taxes excluding the effect of utilization of net operating
losses (“NOLs”) where applicable, plus depreciation and amortization, less changes in net working capital
(including deferred revenue), less capital expenditures and less capitalized software; and
•
Unlevered Free Cash Flow post-NOLs, which is defined as Unlevered Free Cash Flow pre-NOLs, plus the
effect of utilization of NOLs where applicable.
Duck Creek believes that its presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental
information to investors and management regarding Duck Creek’s financial condition and results of operations. Other
firms may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than Duck Creek, which limits comparability between companies.
Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP.
Although the information in the Stand-Alone Projections is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects
numerous estimates and assumptions made by Duck Creek management with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to Duck Creek’s business in each case as of the date it was prepared, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict accurately and many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Certain key material assumptions
underlying the Stand-Alone Projections include the following:
68TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
A majority of software sales being comprised of multi-year subscription licenses to new and existing
customers, including migrations from on-premises installations to SaaS, pursuant to Duck Creek’s strategic
focus on sales of its core SaaS offerings;
•
expansion of subscription gross margins primarily through better leveraging headcount, modifications to
subscription pricing and improvements and operational efficiency in Duck Creek’s hosting costs;
•
reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, as the Company generates greater
productivity from existing resources and hires fewer headcount or offshore headcount in the future to
reduce overall costs; and
•
expansion of Adjusted EBITDA margin resulting from scale and operational efficiencies.

On January 5, 2023, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire IMburse
AG (together with its subsidiaries, “Imburse”), and the acquisition was completed on January 25, 2023. In December
2022, in connection with the evaluation by Duck Creek management of the acquisition of Imburse, Duck Creek
management prepared unaudited forecasted financial information of Imburse for fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year
2027 (the “Imburse Projections”). The Imburse Projections treat Imburse on a stand-alone basis without giving effect
to the Merger. The Imburse Projections were made available to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction,
including Vista, in connection with their due diligence review of a potential transaction.
Although the information in the Imburse Projections is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous
estimates and assumptions made by Duck Creek management with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to Imburse’s
business, in each case as of the date it was prepared, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and
many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Certain key material assumptions underlying the Imburse
Projections include the following:
•
Imburse focusing on sales of its core payments offerings with a majority of software sales being comprised
of subscription license agreements to new customers;
•
commercial sales only in EMEA during fiscal 2023 and sales to US customers commencing in the first fiscal
quarter of 2024;
•
increase in gross margins, primarily resulting from scale in revenue and covering operational fixed costs;
and
•
growth in Adjusted EBITDA, primarily resulting from growth in revenue and scale of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The projections summarized in the table below for the Company’s second through fourth fiscal quarters 2023
through fiscal year 2032 (the “Forecasts”) were prepared on the following basis:
•
projections for fiscal year 2023 reflect actual results from the first fiscal quarter for 2023, as reported by the
Company after the approval of the Stand-Alone Projections;
•
projections for the second through fourth fiscal quarters of 2023 and through 2027 mathematically compute
the combination of the Stand-Alone Projections and the Imburse Projections (which were each unrounded,
but rounded to the nearest million dollars once combined) for those periods; the estimated earnings used to
calculate Adjusted EBITDA included in the Forecasts for the second through fourth fiscal quarters of 2023
include approximately $600,000 in acquisition-related expenses relating to the acquisition of Imburse;
•
projections for fiscal years 2028 through 2032 were extrapolated based on the Stand-Alone Projections and
the Imburse Projections;
•
Unlevered Free Cash Flow pre-NOLs and Unlevered Free Cash Flow post-NOLs for the second through
fourth fiscal quarters of 2023 and through fiscal year 2032, as set forth in the table immediately below, were
calculated based on the projections summarized in the preceding rows in such table; and
•
cash tax savings from estimated usage of NOL carryforwards for the second through fourth fiscal quarters
of 2023 and through fiscal year 2032, as set forth in the table immediately below, were calculated based on
the projections summarized in the preceding rows in such table.
Although the information in the table below is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous
estimates and assumptions made with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory,
market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to Duck Creek’s business, in each
case as of the date it was prepared, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are
beyond the Company’s control.

The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts treat Duck Creek on a stand-alone
basis without giving effect to, and as if Duck Creek never contemplated, the Merger, including the impact of
negotiating or executing the Merger Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating
the Merger, the effect of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the
Merger Agreement having been executed or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would
likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated,
postponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger.
The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward
public disclosure and the summary thereof is included in this Proxy Statement only because (i) the Stand-Alone
Projections were made available to the Board in connection with its review of strategic alternatives, (ii) the Stand-
Alone Projections and the Imburse Projections were made available to potential counterparties to a strategic
transaction, including Vista, in connection with their due diligence review of a potential transaction, and (iii) the
Forecasts were used by JPM for purposes of preparing its financial analyses and fairness opinion

provided to the Board and by Evercore for purposes of preparing its financial analyses and fairness opinion provided
to the Special Committee, each on January 8, 2023, as described in the section entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Duck
Creek’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 55 of this Proxy Statement. The summary of the Stand-Alone
Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts is not being included in this Proxy Statement to influence your
decision whether to vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse
Projections and the Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines
established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of
prospective financial information, or GAAP (and do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP).
Neither KPMG LLP, Duck Creek’s independent registered public accounting firm (“KPMG”), nor any other audit firm
has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Stand-Alone
Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts and, accordingly, KPMG has not expressed an opinion or any
other form of assurance with respect thereto. The KPMG report included in Duck Creek’s Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the year ended August 31, 2022, which is incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement, relates to Duck
Creek’s historical financial information and does not extend to the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections
or the Forecasts and should not be read to do so.
The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts are subject to estimates and
assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation and reflect subjective judgment in many
respects, and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results and
business developments. While presented with numerical specificity, the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse
Projections and the Forecasts are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain,
though considered reasonable by Duck Creek management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and
assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, which are difficult to predict and which are
beyond Duck Creek’s control, including general economic conditions, competition and the risks discussed in this
Proxy Statement under the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”
beginning on page 22 of this Proxy Statement. The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the
Forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Because the Stand-
Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts cover multiple years, by their nature, they become
subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance
that could have an effect on Duck Creek’s business and its results of operations. There can be no assurance that the
projections contained in the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts will be realized, and
actual results may differ materially from those shown therein.
The information in the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts is not factual and
should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The inclusion of the summary of the
Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts in this Proxy Statement should not be regarded
as an indication that Duck Creek or anyone else then considered, or now considers, such summaries to be necessarily
predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. In light of the foregoing,
Duck Creek’s stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance thereon. The Stand-Alone Projections, the
Imburse Projections and the Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial
statements and other information regarding Duck Creek contained in Duck Creek’s public filings with the SEC.
None of Duck Creek, its financial advisors or its or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other
representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Stand-Alone Projections, the
Imburse Projections or the Forecasts, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or
reconcile, the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing
after the date the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts were generated or to reflect the
occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Stand-Alone
Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Since the date of the
Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts, Duck Creek has made publicly available its
actual results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, ended November 30, 2022. You should review Duck
Creek’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 9, 2023 for information about Duck Creek’s
actual results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022. Duck Creek does not intend to make
publicly available any update or other revision to the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the
Forecasts, even in the event that any or all assumptions

are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable law, none of Duck Creek, its financial advisors or its or their
respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to
any Company stockholder or any other person (including Vista, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise) regarding the
Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts, Duck Creek’s ultimate performance compared to
the information contained therein or that forecasted results will be achieved.

In considering the recommendation of the Board that holders of Duck Creek Common Stock vote to adopt the
Merger Agreement, our stockholders should be aware that certain of Duck Creek’s non-employee directors and
executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Duck Creek’s
stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in approving
the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company
stockholders.

director or executive officer since the beginning of the last fiscal year), as a group, hold 3,155,880 shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock, excluding any unvested Company RSAs.
At the Effective Time, each share of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is held by Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers will be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $19.00, without interest.

Each Company RSA held by a director or executive officer that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSA, multiplied by (B)
$19.00, subject to any required withholding of Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to
each Company RSA granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same
terms and conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSA prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date. None of
our directors or executive officers have been granted any Company RSAs on or after January 8, 2023.

Time without payment or consideration.
See the section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 75 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the amounts that would
become payable to each Duck Creek named executive officer in respect of his or her unvested Company RSAs.
Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control
Each of our executive officers is party to a written employment arrangement with Duck Creek Technologies LLC,
a subsidiary of Duck Creek, pursuant to which the executive officer will receive the following severance payments
and benefits upon a termination of the executive officer’s employment without cause or, in the case of Messrs.
Jackowski, Rhodes and Van Biert, resignation for good reason (as defined in the applicable employment agreement)
following the consummation of the Merger, subject to each executive officer’s execution of a general release of
claims:
•
Mr. Jackowski will receive (i) an amount equal to the sum of his then-current annual base salary and target
annual bonus, payable in twelve equal monthly installments following the date of termination or in a lump
sum if such termination takes place within one year following the consummation of the Merger, (ii) a pro-
rated annual incentive bonus for the year of termination, payable based on actual performance at the same
time that such bonuses are paid to other senior executives with respect to the year of termination, (iii)
payment of the employer contributions for twelve months of continued health coverage costs payable in
four quarterly installments following the termination date and (iv) twelve months of outplacement services
not to exceed $20,000.
•
Mr. Rhodes will receive (i) continued payments of his annual base salary and target annual bonus for a
period of twelve months following the date of termination or in a lump sum if such termination takes place
within one year following the consummation of the Merger, (ii) a pro-rated annual incentive bonus for the
year of termination, payable based on actual performance at the same time that such bonuses are paid to
other senior executives with respect to the year of termination, and (iii) continued medical coverage at
active employee rates for twelve months following the termination date (“Continued Medical Coverage”).
•
Mr. Van Biert will receive (i) continued payments of his annual base salary for a period of twelve months
following the date of termination or in a lump sum if such termination takes place within one year following
the consummation of the Merger and (ii) a payment equal to $12,000, in lieu of continued contributions
toward health coverage costs, payable in lump sum on the termination date.
•
Mses. Keeney and Townsend and Mr. Winter will receive (i) continued payments of each executive officers
annual base salary for a period of twelve months following the date of termination or in a lump sum if such
termination takes place within one year following the consummation of the Merger and (ii) the Continued
Medical Coverage.
•
Mr. Vaidyanathan will receive continued payments of his annual base salary for a period of twelve months
following the date of termination or in a lump sum if such termination takes place within one

TABLE OF CONTENTS
year following the consummation of the Merger. Though Mr. Vaidyanathan is entitled to receive the
Continued Medical Coverage under the terms of his employment agreement, he will not receive any health
benefits in connection with the consummation of the Merger as he does not participate in Duck Creek’s
health plans.
•
Ms. Harris and Messrs. Chippari and Foster are no longer employed by Duck Creek and will not receive any
severance payments or benefits in connection with the consummation of the Merger.
Each of our executive officers has also entered into a restrictive covenants agreement with Duck Creek
Technologies LLC, which provides that, during the course of each executive officer’s employment and for the one-
year period following termination of his or her employment for any reason, each executive officer will not compete
with, or solicit any vendors, customers, suppliers, employees, consultants or agents of, Duck Creek Technologies
LLC or its affiliates. The restrictive covenants agreement further provides that each executive officer may not disclose
any proprietary, trade secret or confidential information involving Duck Creek Technologies LLC or its affiliates and
will assign all applicable intellectual property rights to them.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of Duck Creek and
its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements with employees and indemnified persons, which are any
of their current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Duck Creek or any
of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), for any acts or omissions by such indemnified persons or employees
occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, and other similar
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other
similar organizational documents of the subsidiaries of Duck Creek, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger
Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any
adverse manner except as required by applicable law.
In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, during the six-year period commencing at the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each
current or former director or officer of Duck Creek and its subsidiaries (and any person who becomes a director or
officer of Duck Creek or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), to the fullest extent permitted by law or
pursuant to any indemnification agreements with Duck Creek and its subsidiaries in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement, from and against all costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection
with any legal proceeding arising, directly or indirectly, out of or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as an affiliate, director, officer,
employee or agent of Duck Creek, its subsidiaries or their affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; and (2) the Merger, as well as any actions taken
by Duck Creek or its subsidiaries or the Buyer Parties with respect thereto. The Merger Agreement also provides that
Duck Creek and its subsidiaries will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as
incurred by any such indemnified person in the defense of such legal proceeding.
The Merger Agreement also provides that Duck Creek may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as Duck Creek’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier on the
date of the Merger Agreement on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and
amounts) that are no less favorable than those of Duck Creek’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies as
in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain limits on the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy.
The “tail” policy will cover claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.
74
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, without limiting the foregoing, the Merger Agreement requires Parent to cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain, on terms no less advantageous to the indemnified parties, Duck Creek’s directors’ and
officers’ insurance policies for a period of at least six years commencing at the Effective Time. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to pay premiums for such policy or the “tail” policy to the extent such
premiums exceed, on an annual basis, 300% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by Duck Creek, and if
the premium for such insurance coverage would exceed such amount Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Arrangements with Parent
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of our executive officers has had any discussions or negotiations,
or entered into any agreement, with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding the potential terms of their individual
employment arrangements or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates
following the consummation of the Merger. Prior to or following the consummation of the Merger, however, certain
executive officers may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with, Parent, the Company or their respective
affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of
its affiliates after the Effective Time.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on
or otherwise relates to the Merger that may be paid or become payable to each of our named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. Please see the previous portions of this section for further information regarding this
compensation.
The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely
for purposes of this table, that the Merger is consummated on February 21, 2023, and in the case of each named
executive officer, that the named executive officer’s employment is terminated by the Surviving Corporation without
cause, or if applicable, by the named executive officer for good reason, in each case, on that date.
In addition to the assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and the termination of
employment, these estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes
accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in
connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.

"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
The obligation of the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition.
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
the Company stockholders in the Merger is approximately $2.65 billion in cash.
In connection with the financing of the Merger, Vista Fund VIII and Parent have entered into an Equity
Commitment Letter, pursuant to which Vista Fund VIII has agreed to provide Parent with an equity commitment of up
to approximately $2.65 billion in cash, which will be available, together with cash on hand at Duck Creek as of the
Closing, to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the Company stockholders (including payments in
respect of our outstanding equity-based awards payable in connection with the Closing pursuant to the Merger
Agreement) and to pay the fees, expenses and other amounts required to be paid in connection with the Closing by
Duck Creek and the Buyer Parties.
The Equity Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that: (1) Duck Creek is an express third-party
beneficiary thereof in connection with Duck Creek’s exercise of its rights related to specific performance under the
Merger Agreement; and (2) Vista Fund VIII will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief in connection with the exercise of such third-party beneficiary rights. The Equity Commitment
Letter may not be waived, amended or modified except by a written instrument signed by Parent and Vista Fund VIII.
Limited Guarantee
Pursuant to the Limited Guarantee, Vista Fund VIII has agreed to guarantee the due and punctual payment to
Duck Creek of all of the liabilities and obligations of the Buyer Parties under the Merger Agreement (the “Guaranteed
Obligations”).
The obligations of Vista Fund VIII under the Limited Guarantee are subject to an aggregate cap equal to the
Parent Liability Limitation.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Limited Guarantee will terminate upon the earliest of:
•
immediately following the later of the Effective Time and the deposit of the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable to the Company stockholders with the designated payment agent;
•
the valid termination of the Merger Agreement by mutual written consent of Duck Creek, Parent and
Merger Sub;
•
the valid termination of the Merger Agreement by Duck Creek in those certain circumstances specified in
the Limited Guarantee;
•
the indefeasible payment by Vista Fund VIII or the Buyer Parties of an amount of the Guaranteed
Obligations equal to the Parent Liability Limitation;
•
the date that is ninety (90) days following the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms, other than a termination in the scenarios described in the second and third bullet above,
unless prior to the expiration of such ninety (90) day period (i) Duck Creek shall have delivered a written
notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations asserting that Vista Fund VIII or any Buyer Party
alleging that any Buyer Party is liable, in whole or in part, for any portion of the

Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) Duck Creek has commenced a legal proceeding against Vista Fund VIII or
any Buyer Party alleging that any Buyer Party is liable for any payment obligations under the Merger
Agreement or against Vista Fund VIII alleging that amounts are due and owing from Vista Fund VIII
pursuant to the Limited Guarantee, in which case the Limited Guarantee will survive solely with respect to
amounts so alleged to be owing, subject to certain restrictions contained in the Limited Guarantee; and
•
the Company or any of its controlled affiliates acting on its behalf seeks to impose liability upon Vista Fund
VIII in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation, or otherwise challenges any limit on the liability of Vista
Fund VIII under the Limited Guarantee or under the Equity Commitment Letter, or makes any claim arising
under or in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Limited Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter,
or the transactions contemplated thereby, other than certain claims permitted by the Limited Guarantee.

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may
be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) whose shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court
decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in
effect on the date of this Proxy Statement and all of which are subject to change or to differing interpretations at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect.
This discussion is limited to Company stockholders who hold their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock as
“capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). In
addition, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign
jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., estate or gift
taxation) or the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax that may be relevant or
applicable to a particular holder in connection with the Merger. For purposes of this discussion, a “holder” means
either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder (each as defined below) or both, as the context may require.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that
may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances nor does it address any consequences to holders
subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax law, including, for example:
•
banks or other financial institutions;
•
mutual funds;
•
insurance companies;
•
tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations), governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other
governmental organizations;
•
retirement plans or other tax-deferred accounts;
•
S corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities or arrangements);
77TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that accumulates
earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;
•
dealers or brokers in securities, currencies or commodities;
•
traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities;
•
regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts, or entities subject to the U.S. anti-
inversion rules;
•
U.S. expatriates or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent or more of Duck Creek
Common Stock (by vote or value);
•
holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk
reduction transaction;
•
holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as
defined in the Code);
•
holders that received their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in a compensatory transaction, through a
tax-qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
•
holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger;
•
U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or
•
holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and properly demand appraisal of their shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, then the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and
the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock and partners therein should consult their
tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.
No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger described herein. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a
court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
MERGER. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS. 
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
78
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (2) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person as defined in section
7701(a)(30) of the Code.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Duck Creek Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss generally
will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount
that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the
completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-
corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S.
Holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must
determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Duck Creek Common
Stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Subject to the discussion under “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” below, any gain realized by
a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
The gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the
United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at rates generally applicable to U.S.
persons (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise), and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of thirty percent
(30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred and eighty-three
(183) days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in
which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or
a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital
losses of such Non-U.S. Holder; or
•
Duck Creek is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code (“USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five (5)-year period preceding
the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock (the “Relevant Period”) and, if shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are regularly traded on
an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S.
Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than five percent (5%) of Duck
Creek Common Stock at any time during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),
except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we
believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five (5)-year period preceding
the Merger.
Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the Merger.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may also apply
to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a
U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to
backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a
certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s foreign status on an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or a
79
TABLE OF CONTENTS
substitute or successor form) or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or
credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability; provided that the holder timely furnishes the required
information to the IRS.
THE FOREGOING SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME
TAXATION THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO PARTICULAR HOLDERS. IT IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION
ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE
PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE RECEIPT OF CASH FOR THEIR SHARES OF DUCK

LOCAL OR OTHER TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.",87,90
"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
Duck Creek and the Buyer Parties have agreed to use reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary to comply
with all regulatory notification requirements, and to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include approval under,
or notifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust laws (whether domestic or foreign).
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Duck Creek
and Vista Fund VIII file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has
expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a
thirty (30) calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or
the early termination of that waiting period. Duck Creek and Vista Fund VIII made the necessary filings with the FTC
and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on January 18, 2023. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59
p.m. Eastern Time on February 17, 2023.
At any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the
Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate,
assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the

On February 17, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the O’Dell Complaint, naming as defendants
Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On February 22, 2023 a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the
Reddiar Complaint, naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On February 22, 2023 a
purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the Dangerfield Complaint, naming as defendants Duck Creek and each
member of the Board. On February 23, 2023 a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the Powell Complaint, naming
as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
The Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and also that the Board breached its fiduciary duties. Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege
that the Preliminary Proxy Statement contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and information
concerning the Company’s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore in
support of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into between Duck
Creek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek and potential
conflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the Complaints includes
enjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material
information, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the terms thereof,
granting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
disseminate a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required
or necessary material facts, directing the defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the
defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, declaring that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act
as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements,
including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses.
Duck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend
to defend against the Complaints; however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be
required to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.
The outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with
the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the
Merger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered
enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation
of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from
being consummated within the expected time frame.

The following description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is included as Annex A hereto. The Merger
Agreement has been included to provide Company stockholders with information regarding its terms. It is not
intended to provide any other factual information about Duck Creek, Parent, Merger Sub, Vista or their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were
made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific dates therein, were solely for the benefit of the
parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including
being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties to
the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality
applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to Company stockholders. Company
stockholders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries
or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after
the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be reflected in Duck Creek’s public
disclosures. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement
should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings

will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, in each case, in accordance with applicable
laws, rules and regulations, and Duck Creek will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Duck
Creek Common Stock. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and the acceptance for
record of such filing by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as Duck Creek and the
Buyer Parties may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).
Closing and Effective Time
The Closing will take place no later than the second (2nd) business day following the satisfaction or waiver (to
the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement) of all conditions to the Closing (described in the section entitled,
“Terms of the Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” beginning on page 95 of this Proxy
Statement) (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted in the Merger Agreement) of such conditions) or such other time agreed to in writing by Parent and
Duck Creek. On the date on which the Closing actually occurs (the “Closing Date”), the parties will file a certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The Merger will become
effective upon the filing and acceptance for record of the certificate of merger, or such later time as may be agreed by
the parties and specified in the certificate of merger.

Prior to the Closing, Parent will designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Duck Creek to act
as the paying agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”) and to make payments of the Merger Consideration to
Company stockholders. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment
Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration; provided that Duck Creek shall, at
the written request of Parent, and, if requested by Parent, in exchange for a promissory note issued by Parent to the
Company, the amount and terms of which shall be reasonably determined by Parent, deposit with the Payment Agent
at the Closing such portion of such aggregate Merger Consideration from the Company’s Cash on Hand (as defined
in the Merger Agreement) as specified in such request.
Promptly following the Closing (and in any event within three (3) business days), the Payment Agent will send
to each holder of record of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the

Payment Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
represented by the Certificates and book-entry shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Price.
If any cash deposited with the Payment Agent is not claimed within one (1) year following the Closing Date,
such cash will be returned to the Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Duck Creek Common Stock who have not
complied with the exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to the Parent as general
creditor for payment of the Per Share Price (subject to applicable law). Any cash deposited with the Payment Agent
that remains unclaimed two (2) years following the Closing Date will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.",94,94

89TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means an agreement with Duck Creek that contains customary
provisions requiring the counterparty thereto (and any of its affiliates and representatives) that receive material non-
public information of or with respect to Duck Creek and its subsidiaries to keep such information confidential;
provided that the provisions contained therein are no less restrictive in any material respect to such counterparty
(and any of its affiliates and representatives named therein) than the terms of the confidentiality agreement entered
into between Duck Creek and Vista (except that such agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provision
or otherwise prohibit the making of any Acquisition Proposal).
“Acquisition Proposal” means any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by the Buyer Parties) to
engage in an Acquisition Transaction.
“Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Merger)
involving:
(i)
Any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons (in each case, other than the Buyer Parties, their affiliates or
any group that includes the Buyer Parties or their affiliates), whether from Duck Creek or any other
person(s), of securities representing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total outstanding equity
securities of Duck Creek (by vote or economic interests) after giving effect to the consummation of such
purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or
“group” of persons that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or
“group” of persons beneficially owning more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total outstanding equity
securities of Duck Creek (by vote or economic interests) after giving effect to the consummation of such
tender or exchange offer;
(ii)
Any direct or indirect purchase, license or other acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined pursuant
to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons of assets constituting or accounting for more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the consolidated assets, revenue or net income of Duck Creek and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such purchase or acquisition); or
(iii) Any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution
or other transaction involving Duck Creek pursuant to which any person or “group” (as defined pursuant
to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons would hold securities representing more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the total outstanding equity securities of Duck Creek (by vote or economic interests) after
giving effect to the consummation of such transaction.
“Alternative Acquisition Agreement” means any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement.
“Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction on terms
that the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory
and financing aspects of the proposal (including certainty of closing) and the identity of the person making the
proposal and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal that the Special Committee deems relevant, and if
consummated, would be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company stockholders (in their
capacity as such) than the Merger (taking into account any revisions to the Merger Agreement made or proposed in
writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination). For purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition Proposal”
in this definition, all references to “fifteen percent (15%)” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be
deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%)”.

Creek will cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any person and its representatives,
request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning Duck Creek and its subsidiaries
theretofore furnished to any such person with whom a confidentiality agreement was entered into at any time within

(other than to Parent or any designees of Parent), in any such case with the intent to induce the making,

that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Duck Creek and
its subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any person or its affiliates or representatives
that has made or delivered to the Company an Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, with
respect to an Excluded Party, after the date of the Merger Agreement), and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition
Proposal or assist such person (and its affiliates, representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition
Proposal (in each case, if requested by such person), in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from any material breach of Duck Creek’s obligations, as described in the immediately two preceding
paragraphs; provided, however, that the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated by
the above would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; provided further, however, that
the Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to Parent any non-public
information concerning Duck Creek and its subsidiaries that is provided to any such person or its affiliates or
representatives that was not previously made available to Parent.
Duck Creek is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including but not
limited to, negotiating with Parent and its representatives in good faith over a four business day period in an effort to
amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, so that such Superior Proposal contemplated by such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement no longer constitutes a “Superior Proposal” relative to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such negotiations.
If Duck Creek terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Company
stockholders for the purpose of entering into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, Duck Creek must pay the
Company Termination Fee of $78,337,343; provided that if (A) such termination occurs prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date, (B) the Company enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with any person other than
an Excluded Party to consummate an Acquisition Transaction at the time of such termination and (C) no Excluded
Party has provided equity financing for, or any other investment in, such Acquisition Transaction, then the Company
Termination Fee shall be reduced to $39,168,671.
A breach of these “no-solicitation” provisions of the Merger Agreement by any director, officer or other
representative of Duck Creek (other than a consultant or an employee of Duck Creek who is not an officer of Duck
Creek) will be deemed to be a breach of such provisions by Duck Creek. Duck Creek may not authorize, direct or
knowingly permit any consultant or employee of a Duck Creek to breach these “no-solicitation” provisions of the
Merger Agreement, and upon becoming aware of any breach or threatened breach of these provisions by a
consultant or employee of Duck Creek, will use its reasonable best efforts to stop such breach or threatened breach.

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board has made the recommendation
that the Company stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement
provides that the Board (or a committee thereof, including the Special Committee) will not effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change (as defined below) except as described below.
Prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Board (or a committee thereof, including the Special
Committee) may not take any action described in the following (any such action, a “Company Board
Recommendation Change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify, the Board’s recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect;
•
adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the Board’s recommendation within ten business days after Parent so requests in
writing (it being understood that Duck Creek will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more
than three separate occasions);
•
take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a
92TABLE OF CONTENTS
“stop, look and listen” communication by the Board (or a committee thereof, including the Special
Committee) to Company stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Board (or a committee thereof,
including the Special Committee) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
until the close of business on the tenth business day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer
in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of the
Merger Agreement); or
•
fail to include the Board’s recommendation in this Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if
(1) there has been an Intervening Event or (2) the Special Committee determines that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal.
The Board may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change for an Intervening Event if the Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and if and only if:
•
Duck Creek has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) business days in advance to the
effect that the Board (or a committee thereof), upon the recommendation of the Special Committee has (1)
so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, which notice must specify the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
•
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, Duck Creek and its representatives,
during such four (4) business day period, must have negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good
faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Special Committee no longer determines that the failure to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
In addition, the Board may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, or authorize Duck Creek to
terminate the Merger Agreement and to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, in response to a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Special Committee has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if:
•
the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable law;
•
Duck Creek and its subsidiaries and their representatives have otherwise complied in all material respects
with its obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
•
Duck Creek has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) business days in advance (the
“Notice Period”) to the effect that the Board (or a committee thereof), upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, has (1) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2)
concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (3) resolved
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate the Merger Agreement absent any
revision to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the person or “group” of
persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal;
•
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, Duck Creek and its
representatives, during the Notice Period, have negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith
(to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;

in the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause or permit Duck Creek and its
subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, Duck Creek has validly terminated the

For purposes of this Proxy Statement and the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any positive
material event or development or material change in circumstances with respect to Duck Creek (other than in
connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal) that (1) was not actually
known to, or reasonably expected by, the Special Committee or the Board as of the date on which the Merger
Agreement was executed; and (2) does not relate to (a) any Acquisition Proposal; or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself,
that Duck Creek meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of
revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the Merger
Agreement, or changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in the market price or trading volume of Duck Creek

The Merger Agreement provides that, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will honor all of the
benefit plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
benefit plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In addition, after the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the “Continuation
Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will provide employee benefits (other than defined benefit
pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-employment or retiree health or welfare, change in control,
retention or equity-based benefits) to each individual who is an employee of Duck Creek and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and continues to be an employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) (a “Continuing Employee”) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, during the
Continuation Period, base compensation and target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity (other than
equity or equity-based incentive arrangements) will not be decreased for any Continuing Employee. During the
Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation will also provide severance benefits to eligible employees in
accordance with the Company’s severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on January 8, 2023.
The Surviving Corporation will grant any Continuing Employee credit for all service with Duck Creek and its
subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for purposes of vacation
accrual and determining severance amounts, except that (i) service will not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) service will only be credited to the same extent and for the same
purpose as such service was credited under a Duck Creek employee benefit plan or arrangement before the Effective
Time and (iii) no service shall be required to be credited under any plan that provides for equity or equity-based,
defined benefit pension, deferred compensation or post-employment or retiree welfare benefits. In addition, the
Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee will be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such plans replaces
coverage previously provided under a comparable Duck Creek benefit plan or arrangement in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time; (ii) during the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs, for purposes of each employee benefit plan sponsored by the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries that
provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of
the plan will be waived for the Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and full credit will be given
for any eligible expenses incurred by the Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year ending on the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, co-pay, offsets
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to the Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the employee benefit plan
sponsored by the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries; and (iii) the account of each Continuing Employee
pursuant to any flexible spending plan sponsored by the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries will be credited
with any unused balance in the account of the Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but
unused by a Continuing Employee as of

The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of Duck Creek and
its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements with employees and indemnified persons, which are any
of their current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Duck Creek or any
of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), for any acts or omissions by such indemnified persons or employees
occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on

the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, and other similar
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other
similar organizational documents of the subsidiaries of Duck Creek, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger
Agreement. During such six (6)-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in

The Merger Agreement also provides that Duck Creek may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as Duck Creek’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier on the

officers’ insurance policies for a period of at least six (6) years commencing at the Effective Time. Neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation will be required to pay premiums for such policy or the “tail” policy to the extent such
premiums exceed, on an annual basis, three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid
by Duck Creek, and if the premium for such insurance coverage would exceed such amount Parent shall be obligated
to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

Merger Agreement); (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or

thereof; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent in the Equity
Commitment Letter; (iii) consummate the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing; (iv) comply with its
obligations pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and (v) enforce its rights pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter.
In no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to (i) bring any
enforcement action against any source of the Equity Financing to enforce its rights pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent will seek to enforce, including by bringing suit for specific
performance, the Equity Commitment Letter if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of specific performance of
the obligation to consummate the Merger) or (ii) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than a counterparty
to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter.
Debt Financing
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to provide Parent with such
reasonable cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist the Buyer Parties in arranging the debt
financing (if any) to be obtained by the Buyer Parties or their respective affiliates in connection with the Merger (the
“Debt Financing”). The Company’s obligations include, but are not limited to, upon reasonable advance notice,
reasonably cooperating with the marketing and due diligence efforts for any of the Debt Financing, providing
reasonable assistance with the timely preparation of documents required in connection with or proper for the Debt
Financing, subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement.
In no event will the Company or any of its subsidiaries be required to (i) waive or amend any terms of the
Merger Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for which it has not

effective prior to the Closing Date; (iii) give any indemnities in connection with the Debt Financing that are effective
prior to the Effective Time; (iv) take any action that, in the good faith determination of the Company, would
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or create an
unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (v)
take any action that will conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable laws or would result in
a material violation or breach of, or default under, any material agreement to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party.
Obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Closing. If the Debt Financing has not been obtained, the
Buyer Parties will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, to consummate the Merger.
Repaid Indebtedness
At the Closing, the Buyer Parties shall, on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries, pay or cause to be paid

Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21 thereunder, which were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that Duck Creek provide Company stockholders
with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the payment of certain compensation that
will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as
disclosed in the section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger-
Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 75 of this Proxy Statement.
Company stockholders are asked to indicate their approval of the compensation that will or may become payable
by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the
section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger-Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 75 of this Proxy Statement and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the
various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously
formed part of Duck Creek’s overall compensation program for its named executive officers, and previously have been
disclosed to Company stockholders as part of the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and related sections of
Duck Creek’s annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the
Compensation Committee of the Board, which is composed solely of independent directors, and are believed to be
reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, Duck Creek is seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Duck Creek Technologies, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory
basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to Duck Creek’s named executive officers that is based
on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section
entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger-Golden Parachute
Compensation” in Duck Creek’s Proxy Statement for the Special Meeting of stockholders.”
Company stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to consummation of the Merger, and as
an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Duck Creek, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, regardless of the
outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, Duck Creek’s named executive officers will be eligible to
receive the compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions applicable to those payments.

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his, her or its demand
for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL
and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is accessible, without subscription or
cost, at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and
incorporated by reference herein. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in
Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
unless otherwise expressly noted therein or herein, and all such references to a “beneficial owner” mean a person
who is the beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person unless otherwise expressly noted therein or herein.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common
Stock who (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock before the taking of
the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) do not vote in favor of the Merger, (iii) continuously
hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable of such shares through the Effective Time, and (iv) otherwise follow
the procedures set forth in Section 262, will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and
to receive in lieu of the Merger Consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to
be the “fair value” of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair
value as determined by the Court of Chancery (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash
payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262). Unless the Court of
Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue
and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period;
provided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving
Corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of
such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and
the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of
such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such
voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking
appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more
than, the same as or less than the $19.00 per share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement
if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to
appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice either a copy of Section 262 or information
directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without
subscription or cost. This Proxy Statement constitutes Duck Creek’s notice to Company stockholders that appraisal
rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed,
without subscription or cost, at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the Merger, any holder or beneficial
owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve
such person’s right to do so should review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully.
Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of
appraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all
Company stockholders and beneficial owners who assert appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent (1%) of
the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of
the DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock for which appraisal rights have been
106TABLE OF CONTENTS
pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek
appraisal of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, Duck Creek believes that if a Company stockholder or beneficial
owner is considering exercising appraisal rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel. A Company
stockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration as described in the Merger Agreement upon surrender of the certificates that formerly represented
such shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Company stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock must fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the
following:
•
the person must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the person must deliver to Duck Creek a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a
demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform
us of the identity of the stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, and the intention of such person to
demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder’s or beneficial owner's failure to make a written
demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a waiver of
appraisal rights;
•
the person must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective
Time (a stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers
the shares before the Effective Time); and
•
the person, another stockholder or beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal rights or the
Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair
value of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock.
Because a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in
favor of proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.
Making a Written Demand",116,117
"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",Making A Written Demand,"Making a Written Demand
Any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must
deliver to Duck Creek, before the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, a
written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s or beneficial owner shares. The person making the written
demand must be a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner, as applicable, on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made, and such person must continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, the shares as to which
such demand relates through the effective date of the Merger.
A person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement either by ballot or by proxy. In the case of a holder of record shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and it will cause a stockholder to lose the stockholder’s right to appraisal
and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy
and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In the case
of a beneficial owner, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in “street
name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote
107TABLE OF CONTENTS
those shares on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement without specific voting instructions from the beneficial
owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if the
beneficial owner provides such instructions. If a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” instructs such
person's broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person's shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, and does not revoke such instruction prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
then such shares will be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will cause such beneficial
owner to lose his, her or its right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.
Therefore, a beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must either not provide any instructions to such
person's broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or must instruct
such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on
such proposal. Neither voting against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or
failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for
appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s failure
to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the
Special Meeting will cause such person to lose its appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.
A demand for appraisal made by a Company stockholder or beneficial owner should be executed by or on behalf
of the holder of record or beneficial owner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform Duck Creek of the identity of
such stockholder or beneficial owner. In addition, in the case of a demand for appraisal of such beneficial owner, the
demand must also (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (2) be
accompanied by documentary evidence of the beneficial owner’s ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or
securities account statement containing such information or a letter from the broker or other record holder of such
shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of
what it purports to be and (3) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given
by the Surviving Corporation under Section 262 and the verified list required by subsection (f) of Section 262
(discussed further below). Whether made by a Company stockholder or a beneficial owner, a written demand for
appraisal must state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the person's shares in connection with
the Merger. If the shares are held of record or beneficially owned in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of such holder of record or beneficial owner,
and if the shares are held of record or beneficially owned by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a
tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all such joint holders of record or beneficial
owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint stockholders or beneficial owners,
may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record or beneficial owner; however, the agent must
identify the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, respectively, and should expressly disclose that,
in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners,
as applicable.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be mailed or delivered to:

Any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock who has delivered a written demand to
Duck Creek and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may

Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person without
the approval of such court and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery deems
just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any person

Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder,
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all persons entitled to appraisal. If a petition for
appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and Company stockholders and beneficial owners
should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair values of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Accordingly, any holders or beneficial owners of Duck Creek
Common Stock who desire to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be
responsible for filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The
failure of a holder or beneficial owner of Duck Creek Common Stock to file such a petition for appraisal within the
period specified in Section 262 will nullify the person’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock who has complied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, will be entitled,
upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares not voted in favor of the Merger proposal and with respect to which Duck Creek received demands for
appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares of such
common stock (provided that, in the case of a demand made by a beneficial owner in such person's name, the record
holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such
aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting person within ten (10) days
after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within
twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all persons who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to
the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders and beneficial owners as required
by the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons
who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of
Chancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to
comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.",119,119
"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",Determination of Fair Value,"Determination of Fair Value
After determining the persons entitled to appraisal the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Court
of Chancery will appraise the “fair value” of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
109TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of will take into account all
relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the
value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court
must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Court
of Chancery may consider in determining “fair value” and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction
price should be given “considerable weight”. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and
not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their
shares as so determined by the Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration
they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an
investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is
not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Duck
Creek believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of
fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders and beneficial owners should recognize that
such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger
Consideration. Neither Duck Creek nor Parent anticipates offering more than the $19.00 per share Merger
Consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights. Each of Duck Creek and Parent reserves the right to assert, in
any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Duck Creek Common Stock
is less than the $19.00 per share Merger Consideration.
Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five
percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment; provided that if at any time before
the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation pays to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the
amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares
as determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment,
unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment
prior to such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the
fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of
Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may
also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to be appraised not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to
such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.
If any stockholder or beneficial owner who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, the
person’s shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the
Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw,
the person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred

TABLE OF CONTENTS
twenty (120) days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person’s demand for appraisal in respect to some or all of such
person’s shares and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares subject to withdrawal in
accordance with Section 262.

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any
future meetings of Company stockholders. However, if the Merger is not consummated, Company stockholders will
continue to be entitled to attend and participate in Company stockholders’ meetings.
As described in our annual proxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders filed on December 28,
2022, any proposal or proposals by a Company stockholder intended to be included in the proxy statement and form
of proxy relating to the annual meeting of Company stockholders to be held in 2024 must comply with the procedures
set forth in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. To be eligible for inclusion, your proposal(s) must be received by the
Company no later than August 30, 2023. Proposals should be sent to the Secretary of the Company at its principal
executive offices, 22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10, Boston, MA 02210. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
require the Company to include in its proxy statement and proxy relating to the annual meeting of stockholders to be
held in 2024 any Company stockholder proposal which may be omitted from the proxy materials according to
applicable regulations of the SEC in effect at the time the proposal is received.
A Company stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal or nominate a candidate to serve as a director for
consideration at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2024 outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange Act must timely deliver a written notice in accordance with the requirements, including eligibility and
information required in such notice, set forth in Sections 2.15 and 2.16 of the Company’s amended and restated
bylaws. To be timely, such written notice must be received by the Secretary of the Company at its principal executive
offices, 22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10, Boston, MA 02210, not earlier than the close of business on October 25,
2023, nor later than the close of business on November 24, 2023. In the event that the annual meeting of stockholders
to be held in 2024 is not scheduled to occur within twenty-five (25) days before or after February 22, 2024 (the
anniversary of the 2023 annual meeting), the written notice must be received by the Company not later than the close
of business on the tenth (10th) day following (i) the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting for 2024 is
mailed or (ii) the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made, whichever first occurs.
In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements, to comply with the SEC’s universal proxy rules, Company
stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than our nominees must provide
timely notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act.

Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the
“Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly owned subsidiary of Disco Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), among the Company,
the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Disco Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), the Company will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other
than shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or owned by
the Acquiror, Merger Sub and any of their direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and Dissenting Company
Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $19.00 per share in cash (the
“Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated January 8, 2023 of the Agreement;
(ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries
in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available
financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its
business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we
deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that
was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us.
We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that
the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also
assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, the Acquiror and Merger Sub in the
Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are
not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with
respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common
Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in
connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express
no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any
party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the
Company Common Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a
fee from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed
Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or
investment banking relationships with the Company, for which we and such affiliates have received customary
compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunning manager on an
offering of the Company’s equity securities in January 2021 and joint lead arranger and bookrunner on a credit facility
for the Company in October 2021. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have
also had commercial or investment banking relationships with Accenture plc (“Accenture”), the Company’s 15.9%
shareholder, for which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such
period have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on a credit facility for Accenture in April 2021.
During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have also had commercial or investment
banking relationships with portfolio companies of Apax Partners LLP (“Apax”), the Company’s 23.8% shareholder, for
which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have
included providing debt syndication, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to Apax
portfolio companies. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding
credit facilities of Apax portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits.
During the two years preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor our affiliates have had any other material
financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Acquiror. During the two
years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships
with Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC, an affiliate of the Acquiror (“Vista”), and Vista portfolio companies, for
which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Our commercial banking affiliate is an
administrative agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Vista, for which it receives customary
compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, during the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and
our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Vista portfolio companies for which we
and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included
providing debt syndication, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to portfolio
companies of Vista. Our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities
of Vista portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we
and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and
Accenture. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company,
Accenture, Apax portfolio companies or Vista portfolio companies for our own account or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial
instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the consideration to be
paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders.
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.
This letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for
the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any

(j) A reference to any specific legislation or to any provision of any legislation includes any amendment
to, and any modification, re-enactment or successor thereof, any legislative provision substituted therefor and
all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto, except that, for purposes
of any representations and warranties in that Agreement that are made as a specific date, references to any

Company Disclosure Letter. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter constitutes an admission against the
Company’s interest or represents the Company’s legal position or legal rights on the matter so disclosed. No

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, (i) Parent will select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) Parent
will enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with
such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to
which such holders become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7; provided that the Company shall, at the written
request of Parent, deposit with the Payment Agent at the Closing such portion of such aggregate consideration
from the Company Group’s Cash on Hand as specified in such request. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency
or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more
than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the
“Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange
Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is
unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the
payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Closing (and in any event within three Business Days
following the Closing), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (other than Dissenting
Company Shares and Owned Company Shares, as applicable) (the “Certificates”); (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Capital Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares, as applicable)
(the “Uncertificated Shares”): (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Price, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per
Share Price (subject to Section 2.12), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon
receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock represented
by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (subject to Section 2.12), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such
Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares on the Per Share Price, payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this
A-22TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price without interest thereon,
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to
the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures
with the Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC
or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting
Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by
(B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern
time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the
first Business Day after the Closing Date.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. Subject, in all cases, to the terms and conditions of the Charter in respect of
Company Capital Stock, if a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock is not registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or transferred is registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, as applicable, only if, in the case of Company Capital Shares
represented by Certificates, such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and
transfer, or in the case of Uncertificated Shares, a proper transfer instruction is presented, and in either case the
Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.
(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the
Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock, for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the
Closing Date, as applicable, will be delivered to Parent (as directed by Parent) upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, who
have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such
shares of Company Capital Stock, for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of
the Per Share Price without interest thereon, payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price, to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the Closing Date, or at such earlier date as is immediately
prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
representatives) previously entitled thereto.",148,149

Proposal or assist such Person (and its Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal
(in each case, if requested by such Person), in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from any material breach of Section 5.3(b); provided, however, that the Special Committee has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the
Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(c) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and provided further, however, that the Company will promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company

fail to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other
than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company

Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof including the Special Committee) may refrain
from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th
Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E),
a “Company Board Recommendation Change”); provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none
of (1) the determination by the Special Committee that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (2) the delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(e) will
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(e) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval:

Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof), upon the recommendation of the Special Committee,
may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to any positive material event or
development or material change in circumstances with respect to the Company that was (A) not actually
known to, or reasonably expected by, the Special Committee or the Company Board as of the date hereof;
and (B) does not relate to (a) any Acquisition Proposal; or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that the
Company meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of
revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date hereof,
or changes after the date hereof in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock or
the credit rating of the Company (it being understood that the underlying cause of any of the foregoing in
this clause (b) may be considered and taken into

account) (each such event, an “Intervening Event”), if the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and if and only if:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in
advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof), upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee, has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(i), which notice will specify the applicable
Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, during such four Business Day period, must have negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Special Committee no longer
determines that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; or
(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether during the Go-Shop
Period or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, that the Special Committee has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company
Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, in each case if and only if:
(1) the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law;
(2) the Company Group and its Representatives have complied in all material respects with their
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in
advance (the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof), upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee, has (A) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(ii) absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice
Period, must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that
Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that in the event of any material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (it being understood
that the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be three Business Days); and
(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company
Group to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
the Company will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), including
paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b)(iii).

(f) Notice. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within one
Business Day) notify Parent if any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute an Acquisition Proposal are
received by the Company or any of its Representatives or any non-public information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its
Representatives with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person
or “group” of Persons making such offers or proposals (unless, in each case, such disclosure is prohibited
pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or “group” of Persons that is in effect
on the date of this Agreement); and (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such offers or
proposals. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status (and
supplementally provide the terms) of any such offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations.
(g) Certain Disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or
a committee thereof including the Special Committee) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a “stop, look and listen” communication by the

make in good faith in order to comply with applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement,
it being understood that any such statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or a committee thereof,
including the Special Committee) pursuant to this Section 5.3(g) must be subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board (or
any committee thereof including the Special Committee) and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.3, it being
understood that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof including the Special Committee) to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other
than in accordance with Section 5.3(e). In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a committee
thereof including the Special Committee), to the extent required by law, that describes the Company’s receipt of
an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in and of itself, be
deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, or modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) an
adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) a Company Board
Recommendation Change.
(h) Breach by Representatives. The Company agrees that any breach of this Section 5.3 by any director,
officer or other Representative of the Company (other than a consultant or an employee of the Company who is

will not authorize, direct or knowingly permit any consultant or employee of the Company to breach this Section
5.3, and upon becoming aware of any breach or threatened breach of this Section 5.3 by a consultant or
employee of the Company, shall use its reasonable best efforts to stop such breach or threatened breach.

portion of the assets of or equity in, or by acquiring in any other manner, any business of any Person or other
business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or equity interests,

materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable

Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with
respect to any information supplied by the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time

Filing with the SEC. The Buyer Parties will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates to cause, any Other
Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the

to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date

Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing may contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required
Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light

thereof, the Surviving Corporation, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, will be deemed to have waived any right
to object to the Indemnified Person’s entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) each
Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees
and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense
of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such
Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding
effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for
which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the
termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
A-59TABLE OF CONTENTS
Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any
Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect on the date
hereof (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms
(including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will
not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance carrier on the date hereof. The Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the
D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance carrier on the date hereof on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) that are no less favorable than those of the D&O Insurance so long as the
aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to
purchase such a “tail” policy, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so
long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of
the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail”
policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if such person were a Party. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail”
policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter
and the Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all
indemnification agreements entered into with the Company Group; or (iv) applicable law (whether at law or in
equity).
(f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be joint and several.
(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or
impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company Group for any of its
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in
this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change in control” (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.
(b) Existing Arrangements. Subject to this Section 6.11, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Employee Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from in any way amending, modifying or terminating any such
Employee Plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise permitted pursuant to applicable law.
(c) Employment; Benefits. As of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will
continue to employ the employees of the Company Group as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the termination date of an applicable
Continuing Employee) (the “Continuation Period”) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide employee benefits (other than
defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-employment or retiree health or welfare,
change in control, retention or equity-based benefits) to each Continuing Employee that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time (subject to the same exclusions). In each case, during the Continuation Period, base compensation and
target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity (other than equity or equity-based incentive
arrangements) will not be decreased for any Continuing Employee. During the Continuation Period, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance benefits to
eligible employees in accordance with the Company’s severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on
the date hereof that have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 6.11 shall obligate the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue the
employment of any Continuing Employee for any specific period.
(d) New Plans. To the extent that a benefit plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with
the Company Group prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for purposes
of future vacation accrual and determining severance amounts, except that (i) such service need not be credited
to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) such service shall only be credited to
the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited under an analogous Employee Plan, and
(iii) no service shall be required to be credited under any plan that provides for equity or equity-based, defined
benefit pension, deferred compensation or post-employment or retiree welfare benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period,
in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the extent
that coverage pursuant to any such plans (the “New Plan”) replaces coverage previously provided under a
comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, (x) the
Surviving Corporation will cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, and (y) the Surviving Corporation will cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
ending on the Closing Date to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance, co-pay, offsets and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any
New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance
A-61TABLE OF CONTENTS
in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following
the Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals
(except to the extent that such limits or forfeitures applied under the Employee Plans in effect as of the date
hereof).
(e) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing
Employee for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
continue any Employee Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement, or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Person; or (iv) establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.",187,188

their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the
other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and
will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by

granted an award of damages, then the Company may enforce such award and seek additional damages on behalf of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards (which the Buyer Parties and the
Guarantor acknowledge and agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium) subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i); (c) if any of the Buyer Parties wrongfully terminate or willfully breach
this Agreement, or if the Guarantor wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches the Guarantee, then, following the
termination of this Agreement, the Company may seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf

discretion, as agent for such holders, and it is understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims will

declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect, and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",REMEDIES,"9.8 Remedies.
(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise
of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary
damages, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any monetary
damages in lieu of specific performance).
(b) Specific Performance.
(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do
not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, for the
harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and
(C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the
Company nor the Buyer Parties would have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that the
Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing the Buyer Parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the
Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely
completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements
for any Debt Financing under the terms thereof, none of the Company and its Affiliates and their direct and
indirect equityholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against
any Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the
Debt Financing, and in no event shall the Company, any of its Affiliates or its or their direct or indirect
equityholders be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any
Financing Source.

(ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand; and (B) the specific
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Buyer Parties pursuant to
this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or any other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy
at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any
right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.",200,201

the laws of the State of Delaware. Any and all claims, controversies, and causes of action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute, shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of
Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws or other rules that would
result in the application of the laws or statutes of limitations of a different jurisdiction.

any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger and the Guarantee, for and on behalf of itself or any of its
properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable
law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties
and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the

therefrom)) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement,

defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any
Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such
Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi)

Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.
(b) Jurisdiction for Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt
Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any
appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or
support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
any applicable debt commitment letter will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal
Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent
A-75TABLE OF CONTENTS
permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v)
any such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York.
