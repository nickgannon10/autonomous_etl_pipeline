(Page 47)
At a meeting of our board of directors held on February 14, 2022, our board of directors approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and the
Merger. Our board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of MoneyGram vote “for” the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger. In the course of reaching its decision, our board of directors consulted with our senior management and our financial
and legal advisors, reviewed a significant amount of information and considered a number of factors, including, among others, the following factors:
•
(a) the fact that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration represented a premium of approximately (i) 50% to $7.34,
the closing price of our Common Stock on December 14, 2021, the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a possible
transaction, (ii) 28% to $8.62, the closing price on February 11, 2022, the last trading day prior to the approval of our board of directors
of the Merger, and (iii) 56% to the volume-weighted average trading price of $7.04 for the 90-day
5Table of Contents
period ended December 14, 2021, the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a possible transaction; (b) the belief of our
board of directors that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as the Merger Consideration was the highest price per share that MDP
was willing to agree to pay; and (c) that the Merger Consideration would be paid solely in cash without a financing contingency;
•
the possibility that a third party with sufficient financial means would agree to a transaction at a higher price than MDP on similar or
more favorable terms, given the fact that the Merger is the result of an extensive sale process conducted by BofA Securities;
•
the risks associated with continued independence, including the risks associated with operating in a highly competitive and regulated
industry, risks associated with our indebtedness, including our debt service obligations, and uncertainties relating to inflation, potential
war in Ukraine and COVID-19;
•
information with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and business strategy on a
historical and prospective basis, current industry, economic and market conditions and trends, as well as the potential future value of
MoneyGram, together with the risks associated with continued independence, as compared to the value of the Merger Consideration;
•
the opinion provided by BofA Securities as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by
holders of our Common Stock;
•
the business reputation and capabilities of MDP and its management, MDP’s experience executing acquisitions, the resources available
to MDP to complete the Merger and the strong commercial incentives of MDP to timely obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and
complete the Merger;
•
the terms of the committed debt financing obtained by Merger Sub and the committed equity financing provided by affiliated funds of
MDP, including the nature and limited number of the conditions to the debt financing and equity financing;
•
the likelihood that the Merger would be completed in light of, among other things, the conditions to the Merger and the absence of a
financing condition, the absence of any condition related to the receipt of third party commercial consents or approvals, the relative
likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals prior to the end date, Parent’s representations and warranties relating to the
equity commitment letter, the debt commitment letter and Parent’s solvency, and the remedies available to us under the Merger
Agreement in the event of various breaches by Parent, including the limited guarantee and the $30 million reverse termination fee
payable by Parent in specified circumstances when required money transfer approvals have not been obtained;
•
the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement were the result of robust arm’s length negotiations conducted by MoneyGram;
•
the fact that the Merger would be subject to the approval of MoneyGram’s stockholders, and that MoneyGram’s stockholders would be
free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at MoneyGram’s stockholder meeting;
•
the current state of the economy, debt financing markets, political climate and general uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic
and political conditions, both in the near term and the longer term, and both generally and within our industry;
•
the fact that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration represents a discount of approximately 9% to the 52-week
high of MoneyGram’s stock of $12.04 reached on July 22, 2021;
•
the risk that the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including the restrictions on the conduct of our business, may adversely
affect MoneyGram’s business and/or cause substantial harm to relationships with our employees, agents, customers and partners and
may divert management and employee attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business, and the fact that the time
6
Table of Contents
period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger will be significant due to the expected time
necessary to obtain required regulatory approvals enhances such risk;
•
the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied or will
be satisfied prior to the end date (after giving effect to any extension thereof already provided for in the Merger Agreement), and, as a
result, the possibility that the Merger might not be completed;
•
the fact that, if the Merger is not completed, (i) we will have incurred significant risk and transaction and opportunity costs and may not
be compensated completely or at all for such costs through the payment of a termination fee, (ii) it is likely that the price of our Common
Stock will decline significantly and (iii) the market’s perception of our prospects could be adversely affected;
•
the risk that necessary regulatory approvals may be delayed, conditioned or denied, the fact that the standards for obtaining the
required money transmitter approvals are not strictly quantitative and are instead subject to interpretation by the applicable regulatory
bodies, the fact that the debt and equity financing necessary to fund the purchase price and the ultimate composition of Parent’s
capital structure could affect Parent’s ability to obtain and the fact that Parent’s obligations under the Merger Agreement to obtain
regulatory approvals are limited in certain ways;
•
the risk that, while the Merger Agreement is not by its terms subject to a financing condition, if Parent fails to obtain sufficient
financing (notwithstanding the terms of the debt commitments and equity commitments), the Merger may not be consummated and the
termination fee of $65.5 million payable to us by Parent in such event may not be sufficient to compensate us for potential losses we
may incur under such circumstances;
•
the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to MoneyGram’s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes;
•
the fact that MoneyGram will no longer exist as an independent public company and MoneyGram’s stockholders will forgo any future
increase in MoneyGram’s value that might result from our earnings or possible growth as an independent company; and
•
the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.
In the course of its deliberations, our board of directors also considered a number of additional potentially positive factors and a number of
potentially negative factors regarding the Merger, as more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger and
Recommendation of Our Board of Directors.” Our board of directors concluded that, overall, the potentially positive factors outweighed the
potentially negative factors. Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of MoneyGram and its stockholders.

If the Merger is completed, MoneyGram’s stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, properly demand an
appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that you are entitled to have the fair value of your shares of our Common Stock determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment based on that valuation in lieu of the Merger Consideration if you follow exactly the procedures
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. The ultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount
you would have received under the Merger Agreement.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to MoneyGram before the vote is taken on the proposal to approve

(Page 80)
The total amount of funds necessary to consummate the Merger and the related transactions will be funded by a combination of equity and debt
financing. The Guarantors have committed to provide equity financing to Parent pursuant to an equity commitment letter (of which MoneyGram is a
third-party beneficiary), in the aggregate amount set forth therein, subject to the terms of such equity commitment letter. The Lenders have
committed to provide debt financing to Merger Sub pursuant to a debt financing commitment letter in the aggregate amount set forth therein, subject
to the terms of such debt commitment letter. The aggregate funds committed to be made available to Parent and Merger Sub under the equity
commitment letter and the debt commitment letter, respectively, will provide in the aggregate sufficient funds to consummate the Merger and the
related transactions, including the aggregate funds needed to (i) pay our stockholders the aggregate Merger Consideration due to them under the
Merger Agreement; (ii) make payments pursuant to the Merger Agreement in respect of outstanding MoneyGram LTI Awards granted under the
Company Stock Plan (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and Performance Cash Awards”); (iii)
repay the outstanding indebtedness and other obligations of MoneyGram under its existing credit agreement and redeem its existing notes at the
required redemption price; and (iv) pay fees, premiums and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement and in
connection with the debt financing and the repayment of MoneyGram’s existing indebtedness. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Generally, stockholders will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the
adjusted tax basis of the shares of our Common Stock surrendered. MoneyGram stockholders who are U.S. holders (as defined in the section entitled
“The Merger—Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any
gain recognized in connection with the Merger. MoneyGram stockholders who are non-U.S. holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless the stockholder has certain connections to the United States. MoneyGram
stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax consequences to them of the Merger based on their particular

“Summary” and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents
referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully. You may obtain the information incorporated by
reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Throughout this proxy statement, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to MoneyGram.
Q:
What is the Merger?
A:
The Merger is the acquisition of MoneyGram by Parent, an affiliate of MDP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Once the Merger Agreement has
been approved and adopted by MoneyGram’s stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or, if
permitted, waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into MoneyGram. MoneyGram will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Q:
Why am I receiving the proxy materials?
A:
You are receiving this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card or enclosed voting instruction form because our board of directors is soliciting
your proxy to vote at the special meeting of MoneyGram’s stockholders in connection with a proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement. In addition, our board of directors is soliciting your vote on an advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or
may become payable to MoneyGram’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger and on a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to
a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
special meeting.
Q:
What will I receive in the Merger?
A:
If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $11.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of our
Common Stock that you own at the effective time of the Merger. For example, if you own 100 shares of our Common Stock at the effective time of
the Merger, you will receive $1,100.00 in cash, less any required withholding taxes, in exchange for those shares unless you have properly exercised
your appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares. You will not receive any shares of capital stock in the
surviving corporation.
Q:
How does our board of directors recommend I vote?
A:
Our board of directors has adopted resolutions (i) determining that the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are
fair to, and in the best interests of MoneyGram and the stockholders of MoneyGram, (ii) approving, adopting and declaring advisable and
authorized in all respects the Merger Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii) directing that
the Merger be submitted to the stockholders of MoneyGram for approval at a meeting of such stockholders and (iv) recommending that
MoneyGram’s stockholders approve the Merger and approve all other actions or matters necessary or desirable to give effect to the Merger
pursuant to the DGCL. Our board of directors unanimously recommends that all of our stockholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement. The reasons for our board of directors’ determination are discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement. Additionally, our board
of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to MoneyGram’s
named executive officers in connection with the Merger and FOR the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting.

Q:
Who will own MoneyGram after the Merger?
A:
After the Merger, MoneyGram will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the receipt of cash in exchange for your shares of
Common Stock following the Merger, you will no longer benefit from any increase in MoneyGram’s value, nor will you acquire an ownership
interest in Parent.
Q:
What will happen if our board of directors receives a superior proposal?
A:
In the event our board of directors receives a proposal that our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
and financial advisors, constitutes a superior proposal, then, subject to complying with certain provisions of the Merger Agreement (including the
provision that requires us to provide Parent with the opportunity to negotiate with us to revise the terms of the Merger such that the proposal no
longer constitutes a superior proposal), our board of directors may, prior to obtaining the MoneyGram Stockholder Approval, elect to terminate the
Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the superior proposal, provided that Parent shall have received a
termination fee of $32.8 million (or $16.4 million if the superior proposal was made by an exempted person (as defined in the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Go-Shop”), or $30.0 million if the superior proposal was made by an exempted person who is also prior bidder). In the event
our board of directors terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the date of the special meeting, we will not hold the special meeting, and any
proxies received by us will have no force or effect. Instead, we will separately prepare and mail to our stockholders a proxy statement and proxy
cards related to the superior proposal.
For additional information regarding the circumstances in which our board of directors is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a
superior proposal, please see “The Merger Agreement—Termination” beginning on page 111 of this proxy statement.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working to complete the Merger as soon as possible. The Merger cannot be completed until each closing condition has been satisfied or, to
the extent legally permitted, waived. While we cannot predict the exact timing of the effective time of the Merger or whether the Merger will be
consummated, assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, we currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed during the
fourth quarter of 2022. If our stockholders vote to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger will become effective not later than the
third business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the Merger, subject to the completion or waiver of the marketing
period under the Merger Agreement. Additionally, the Merger Agreement may be terminated if the effective time of the Merger has not occurred on
or before February 14, 2023 (provided, that such date may be extended, in certain circumstances, to June 8, 2023 to permit receipt of required money
transfer approvals or completion of the marketing period). See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the
Merger” beginning on page 109 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by our stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of our Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public
company, and our Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay to
Parent a fee, or Parent may be required to pay us a fee, with respect to the termination of the Merger Agreement as described under the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me?
A:
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Generally, you will recognize gain or loss equal to
20
Table of Contents
the difference between the amount of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our Common Stock. If you are a U.S. holder (as
defined in “The Merger—Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), you generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger. If you are a non-U.S. holder, you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless you have certain connections to the United States. The tax consequences
of the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your own tax advisors to determine how the Merger will
affect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger—Material United States
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What will happen in the Merger to stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards that have been granted to employees,
officers and directors of MoneyGram?
A:
The Merger Agreement provides that (a) each outstanding option to purchase shares of Common Stock (each a “MoneyGram Option Award”)
granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, whether or not vested, that has an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
will automatically be cancelled and retired, (b) each restricted stock unit subject to time-based vesting (including any award originally subject to
performance-based vesting for which the performance period has been completed and performance threshold satisfied and which is now subject
solely to time-based vesting) granted prior to January 1, 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan representing the right to receive shares of
Common Stock that has not been settled (each, a “MoneyGram Pre-2023 Time-Based RSU Award”) will automatically become fully vested and will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the
Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such MoneyGram Pre-2023 Time-Based RSU Award, (c) each
restricted stock unit subject to performance-based vesting granted prior to January 1, 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan representing the
right to receive shares of Common Stock for which the performance period has not been completed (each, a “MoneyGram Pre-2023 Performance-
Based RSU Award”) will automatically become vested as to a number of shares of Common Stock subject to such MoneyGram Pre-2023
Performance-Based RSU Award based on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement at the greater of the
target level and the actual level of performance achieved immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and will be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii)
such vested number of shares of Common Stock, and (d) each performance-based cash award granted prior to January 1, 2023 pursuant to the
Company Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, representing the right to receive cash payments, whether subject to performance-based vesting
requirements or time-based vesting requirements (each, a “MoneyGram Pre-2023 Performance Cash Award”), will automatically become fully vested
and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the aggregate cash
amount payable pursuant to such MoneyGram Pre-2023 Performance Cash Award based on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the
applicable award agreement at the greater of the target level and the actual level of performance achieved immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger.
The Merger Agreement also provides that, to the extent that any restricted stock units subject to either time-based or performance-based vesting
granted in or following calendar year 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, representing the right to receive shares of Common Stock
(including any award originally subject to performance-based vesting for which the performance period has been completed and performance
threshold satisfied and which is now subject solely to time-based vesting) (such awards, a “MoneyGram 2023 RSU”), such MoneyGram 2023 RSUs
will automatically be converted into a cash-settled long-term incentive award, representing a right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of
21
Table of Contents
shares of Common Stock underlying such MoneyGram 2023 RSU (with any MoneyGram 2023 RSU subject to performance-based vesting converted
based on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement at the greater of the target level and the actual level of
performance achieved immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger), on the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to such
MoneyGram 2023 RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.
Q:
Do any of our directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests as a stockholder?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, you should
be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally. Our board of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in making its determinations and
recommendations in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. See the section entitled “The Merger—
Interests of MoneyGram’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger” beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement.
Q:
When and where is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting of our stockholders will be held virtually on May 23, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MGI2022SM. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in person. For purposes of
attendance at the special meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present in person” or “in person” shall mean virtually present at the
special meeting.
Q:
What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?
A:
A majority of the total shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting is required for a quorum. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you do not vote for the
proposals, or abstain from voting in respect of the proposals, your shares of Common Stock will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a
quorum is present for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining whether
there is a quorum at the special meeting.
Q:
What vote is needed to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock as of the record date is required to approve
and adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement.
Q:
Why are we asking that our stockholders approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, certain compensation arrangements for our named
executive officers?
A:
SEC rules require that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote on this proposal. However, approval of this proposal is not a
condition to completion of the Merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is only an advisory vote by stockholders. Accordingly, the vote
will not be binding on us or Parent, our or their board of directors or our compensation committee. If the Merger is completed, the compensation
that is the subject of the proposal may be paid to our named executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of their compensation
agreements and arrangements even if our stockholders do not approve this proposal.
Q:
What vote is needed to approve the advisory, non-binding proposal relating to certain Merger-related executive compensation arrangements for
our named executive officers and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting?
A:
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting are needed to approve the advisory, non-binding proposal relating to
certain Merger-related executive compensation arrangements for
22
Table of Contents
our named executive officers and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect
on the approval of these proposals.
Q:
Am I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?
A:
If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly
demand appraisal of their shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of our Common Stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court
of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court.
Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of their legal and financial advisors with
respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are
described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to
this proxy statement. See the section entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 74 of this proxy statement.
Q:
Who can vote at the special meeting?
A:
Stockholders of record of our Common Stock as of the close of business on April 20, 2022, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to
receive notice of the special meeting and vote their shares at the meeting. Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of the
Common Stock held on the record date for each of the proposals set forth in this proxy statement.
Q:
How do I vote if I am the record holder of my shares?
A:
You are entitled to vote at the meeting if you are a stockholder of record of Common Stock on the record date. You may vote:
•
in person by attending and casting your vote virtually at the special meeting; or
•
by proxy. Stockholders of record have a choice of submitting a proxy:
•
by using the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card;
•
by using the telephone voting instructions printed on your proxy card; or
•
by completing, signing, dating and returning each enclosed proxy card you receive in the enclosed postage paid envelope.
If you are granting a proxy to vote by telephone or via the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by the date and time indicated on the
applicable proxy card(s).
Granting a proxy to vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mailing in your proxy card will not prevent you from voting in person at the special
meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, via the Internet or by telephone even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, to
ensure that your shares of Common Stock are present in person or represented at the special meeting.
If you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the box showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted “FOR” the
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may
become payable to MoneyGram’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting
to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
23
Table of Contents
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting. With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the special
meeting, shares present or represented by all proxies received by MoneyGram will be voted with respect to such matter in accordance with the
judgment of the persons named as attorneys-in-fact in the proxies.
Q:
How do I vote if my shares are held by my brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee?
A:
If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust, then you are considered to be the beneficial owner of
those shares, with your shares being held in “street name.” “Street name” holders generally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead
instruct the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares. Brokerage firms, banks, trusts or other nominees cannot exercise
discretionary authority to vote your shares regarding proposals that are not “routine.” The proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,
the advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with
the Merger, and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting are not considered “routine,” and therefore your brokerage firm,
bank, trust or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares for you at the special meeting if you instruct it how to vote. Accordingly, it
is important that you promptly follow the directions provided by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee regarding how to instruct it to
vote your shares. If you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must bring a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee
authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.
In addition, because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of
record, shares held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. To be sure your shares are voted,
you should instruct your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be
voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, proxies corresponding to shares held through the MoneyGram
International, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) will be voted as described in the section entitled, “The Special Meeting—Votes Required”
beginning on page 32 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What happens if I do not vote?
A:
The vote to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of
business on the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. If you do not vote and there is a quorum present at the special meeting, it will have no impact on the
proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to MoneyGram’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger or the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
How do the Company’s directors and executive officers intend to vote?
A:
As of April 20, 2022, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned in the aggregate 3,241,298 shares of Common Stock, or approximately
3.4% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of April 20, 2022. Although none of the directors or executive officers is obligated to vote to
approve the Merger, we currently expect that each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares in favor of each of the proposals to be
presented at the special meeting.
24
Table of Contents
Q:
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?
A:
If your shares are registered in your name with MoneyGram’s transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are the “stockholder of record” of those
shares. In that case, the proxy statement and any accompanying documents have been provided directly to you by MoneyGram.
If your shares are not registered in your own name and, instead, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee holds your shares, you are a “beneficial
owner” of shares held in “street name.” The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at
the special meeting. The proxy statement and any accompanying documents have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trust or other
nominee. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares by using the
voting instruction form or by following their instructions for voting by telephone or on the Internet.
Under the rules applicable to broker-dealers, your bank, broker, or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on any
of the proposals scheduled to be voted on at the special meeting. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees
return a valid proxy but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not
received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. MoneyGram does not expect any broker non-votes at the special
meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals
that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the special meeting are considered non-routine under the federal
securities laws. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Common Stock at the special meeting without receiving instructions.
Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will (i) have the same effect as a vote “against” the Merger Agreement and (ii) will cause
your shares not to be counted toward a quorum, but will have no effect on the proposal to approve compensation, or the proposal to adjourn the
special meeting, if a quorum is present.
Q:
How can I change or revoke my vote?
A:
Proxies may be revoked or changed if you:
•
deliver a signed, written revocation letter, dated later than the proxy and which must be received prior to the special meeting, to MoneyGram
International, Inc., 2828 North Harwood Street, 15th Floor, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate Secretary;
•
deliver a signed proxy, dated later than the prior proxy and which must be received prior to the special meeting;
•
vote again by telephone or on the Internet by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the day before the special meeting; or
•
attend the special meeting and give notice to the inspector of election that you intend to vote virtually at the special meeting rather than by
proxy. Your attendance at the special meeting will not revoke your proxy unless you choose to vote virtually at the special meeting.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you must contact such broker, bank, trust or other nominee and
follow its procedures to revoke your proxy. If you are a participant in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
May 18, 2022.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a proxy, to vote your shares of stock. The written document describing the
matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a proxy statement. The document used to designate a proxy to vote your
shares of stock is called a proxy card. Our board of directors has designated W. Alexander Holmes and Robert L. Villaseñor, and each of them, with
full power of substitution, as proxies for the special meeting.
25
Table of Contents
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Common Stock voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, as your proxies, will vote your shares of Common
Stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares
of Common Stock should be voted for or against, or to abstain from voting, on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before
the special meeting.
If you are the stockholder of record, and you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted
on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,
“FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to MoneyGram’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting. If you are the beneficial owner of
shares held in street name, your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions from you.
Q:
What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
A:
If you hold shares of Common Stock in “street name” and also directly as a record holder or otherwise, you may receive more than one proxy and/or
set of voting instructions relating to the special meeting. Each proxy should be voted and/or returned separately in accordance with the
instructions provided in this proxy statement in order to ensure that all of your shares of Common Stock are voted.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock before the special meeting?
A:
The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you transfer your shares of
Common Stock after the record date but before the special meeting you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the
special meeting but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares.
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
The expenses of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the proxies solicited hereby will be borne by us. Our directors, officers
and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional
amounts for soliciting proxies.
We have engaged Alliance Advisors LLC (“Alliance”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. We estimate that we will pay
Alliance a fee of approximately $15,000, plus customary administrative fees for expenses related to calls made to or received from our stockholders.
We will reimburse Alliance for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify Alliance and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities,
losses, damages and expenses.
We may also reimburse brokers, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock
for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Common Stock and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, please
submit a proxy promptly to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares of Common Stock in
your own name as the stockholder of record, please submit a proxy to have your shares of Common Stock voted at the special meeting by
completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid
26
Table of Contents
reply envelope; by using the telephone number printed on your proxy card; or by using the Internet instructions printed on your proxy card. If you
decide to attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you are a
beneficial owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above choices are
available to you.
Q:
Should I send in my MoneyGram stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for exchanging your shares of our Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration for each share of our Common Stock that you own at the effective time of the Merger, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Q:
I do not know where my stock certificate is. How will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares?
A:
If the Merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the Merger will include the procedures that you must
follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock
certificate. MoneyGram may also require that you provide a customary indemnity agreement to MoneyGram in order to cover any potential loss.
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as banks, brokers and other nominees, to satisfy the delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single
proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process is commonly referred to as “householding.”
This means that only one copy of this proxy statement may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household unless we have received
contrary instructions from one or more stockholders. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of this proxy statement to you if you contact us at
the following address: MoneyGram International, Inc., 2828 North Harwood Street, 15th Floor, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate Secretary,
telephone: (214) 999-7552. If you want to receive separate copies of the proxy statement or annual report to stockholders in the future, or if you are
receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy per household, you should contact your bank, broker, or other nominee record
holder, or you may contact us at the above address or telephone number.
See the section entitled “Multiple Stockholders Sharing One Address” beginning on page 125 of this proxy statement for more information.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
MoneyGram intends to announce the preliminary voting results of the special meeting and disclose the final voting results in a Current Report on
Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that MoneyGram files with the SEC are publicly available when
filed.
Q:
Who can help answer my other questions?
A:
If you have additional questions about the Merger, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares of Common Stock, or need

and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

At the special meeting, we will ask holders of our Common Stock to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Our stockholders will also be asked to
approve an advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with

votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting.

Only holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on April 20, 2022, which is the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to
notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, 96,278,259 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding and held by approximately
6,873 holders of record. A majority of the shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting present or
represented by proxy at the special meeting is required for a quorum. Shares of our Common Stock represented at the special meeting but not voting,
including shares of our Common Stock for which proxies have been received but for which stockholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the
special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business at the special meeting. Shares
represented by broker non-votes will not be considered present and entitled to vote at the special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of
a quorum.
Votes Required
The proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our
Common Stock as of the record date. Accordingly, if you abstain or fail to vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, or if you fail
to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the approval and adoption of
the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must direct your broker, bank or other
nominee how to vote your shares of Common Stock by following their instructions for voting. Brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of our
Common Stock in street name for customers who are the beneficial owners of those shares are not permitted to vote those customers’ shares in the
absence of specific instructions from those customers.
The advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to MoneyGram’s named executive officers in connection
with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting, excluding abstentions and broker
non-votes, which shall not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly, assuming that a quorum is present, not voting at the special meeting, or abstaining
from voting, will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and the vote
with respect to this proposal is only an advisory vote by stockholders. Accordingly, the vote will not be binding on us, Parent or MDP, any of our boards
of directors or our compensation committee. If the Merger is completed, the compensation that is the subject of the proposal may be paid to our named
executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if our stockholders do not
approve this proposal.
32Table of Contents
The proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special
meeting, excluding abstentions and broker non-votes, which shall not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly, assuming that a quorum is present, not
voting at the special meeting, or abstaining from voting, will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. MoneyGram does not intend to call a vote
on this proposal if the Merger Agreement is approved and adopted at the special meeting. The vote required on this proposal is a vote separate and apart
from the vote to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, and is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, you may vote to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve the proposal regarding the adjournment of the special meeting and vice versa.
MoneyGram does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide
brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine.” Since each of the proposals to be presented at the special
meeting are not considered “routine” under the applicable rules, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Common Stock at the special meeting
without receiving instructions.
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares of Common Stock in any of the following ways:
•
by casting your vote at the special meeting; or
•
by proxy. Stockholders of record have a choice of submitting a proxy:
•
by using the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card;
•
by using the telephone voting instructions printed on your proxy card; or
•
by completing, signing, dating and returning each enclosed proxy card you receive in the enclosed postage paid envelope.
If you are not a stockholder of record, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above
choices are available to you. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote at the special meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.
If you are a participant in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy will serve as a voting instruction to the Independent Fiduciary (as defined in the 401(k) Plan). The
Independent Fiduciary shall instruct the 401(k) Plan Trustee how to vote. The Independent Fiduciary shall follow each participant’s instructions unless it
determines that doing so would be contrary to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). If no voting instructions
are received from a participant in the 401(k) Plan, the trustee will vote those shares in accordance with the majority of shares voted in the 401(k) Plan for
which instructions were received, unless the Independent Fiduciary determines that doing so would be contrary to ERISA and instructs the trustee to
vote such shares differently.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Common Stock, and to confirm
that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that if you submit
a proxy over the Internet, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be responsible.
Holders of record of our shares of outstanding Common Stock on the record date are entitled to one vote per share on each matter to be considered at the
special meeting. Holders of securities convertible or exercisable for our Common Stock, such as stock options, will not be able to vote such shares
underlying such securities.

Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned, recessed or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. In the
event that there is present, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the MoneyGram Stockholder Approval to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement, MoneyGram does not anticipate that it will adjourn or postpone the special meeting unless it is advised by counsel that
failure to do so could reasonably be expected to result in a violation of applicable law.
If a quorum is present, the special meeting may be adjourned or recessed by the chairman of the special meeting or by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Any
adjournment, recess or postponement of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow MoneyGram’s stockholders who
have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the special meeting as adjourned, recessed or postponed.

Our board of directors has approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and the Merger. If the Merger agreement is approved and adopted by
MoneyGram’s stockholders, then, subject to other closing conditions as described in “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the
Merger,” Merger Sub will be merged with and into MoneyGram, and MoneyGram will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. We strongly encourage you to read carefully the Merger Agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A
to this proxy statement, because it is the contract that governs the Merger.
If the Merger is completed, each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than certain shares as
set forth in the Merger Agreement, including shares for which the holders thereof have properly exercised appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL with respect to such Common Stock) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder of
MoneyGram. In the case of shares of our Common Stock represented by certificates, you will receive the Merger Consideration for your shares of
Common Stock after exchanging your stock certificates in accordance with the instructions contained in a letter of transmittal to be sent to you shortly
after completion of the Merger. In the case of shares of our Common Stock held in book-entry form, you will receive the Merger Consideration for your
shares of Common Stock as promptly as practicable following the Merger without the requirement to deliver a stock certificate or, unless reasonably
requested by the paying agent, a letter of transmittal.
The Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is designated for trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “MGI.” Following the
Merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq and will no longer be publicly traded, and the registration of our Common Stock under the
Exchange Act will be terminated.

Background of the Merger",44,44
MONEYGRAM INTERNATIONAL INC_20220421_DEFM14A_20027475_4446252.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
On a regular basis, we and our board of directors, together with our financial and legal advisors, review and evaluate strategic opportunities and
alternatives with a view to enhancing stockholder value. Such opportunities and alternatives our board of directors has reviewed include refinancing our
outstanding debt, strategic investments in other companies, new strategic initiatives and product offerings, remaining as a stand-alone entity, and a
potential sale of MoneyGram.
In January 2017, MoneyGram entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Ant Merger Agreement”) to be acquired by Alipay (UK) Limited (“Ant
Financial”) at a price of $13.25 per share in cash, which agreement was subsequently amended in April 2017 to, among other things, increase the purchase
price to $18.00 per share following an intervening offer by Euronet Worldwide, Inc. to acquire MoneyGram for $15.20 per share in cash.
In January 2018, MoneyGram and Ant Financial agreed to terminate the Ant Merger Agreement due to the expectation that the transaction would not
receive approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In connection with such termination, Ant Financial paid MoneyGram a
$30 million reverse termination fee as required under the Ant Merger Agreement.
36Table of Contents
On November 8, 2018, MoneyGram announced that it had agreed to extend its 2012 deferred prosecution agreement (the “DPA”) with the United States
Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District
of Pennsylvania (collectively the “Department”) by 30 months and agreed to pay a $125 million fine due to alleged weaknesses in MoneyGram’s anti-
money laundering program resulting in a breach of the DPA. MoneyGram paid $70 million of the fine in November 2018, with the remaining $55 million to
be paid in May 2020. In the trading day following MoneyGram’s announcement of the DPA extension, MoneyGram’s stock price declined 49%, from $4.47
to $2.27.
In January 2019, at the direction of our board of directors, MoneyGram launched a strategic review process, with the assistance of its financial advisor,
BofA Securities, Inc., during which BofA Securities broadly solicited potential purchasers of MoneyGram in an effort to enable our board of directors to
determine whether a transaction may be available that would be in the best interests of MoneyGram stockholders. During the process, BofA Securities,
on behalf of MoneyGram, contacted 22 potential buyers, consisting of 6 potential strategic buyers and 16 potential financial buyers, including MDP and
several other parties contacted during the 2021 sale process, as described below. Of the 22 contacted parties, only one party, a private equity firm, referred
to as Party A, submitted a non-binding acquisition proposal, which provided for a purchase price of $2.75 to $3.25 per share, while MoneyGram’s stock
price was $2.53 per share on February 27, 2019, the date the proposal was received. After discussion among our board of directors and its financial and
legal advisors, our board of directors instructed BofA Securities to tell the potential buyer that a proposal of $2.75 to $3.25 was not compelling at such
time. Discussions with the potential buyer then ceased.
During the spring of 2019, MoneyGram contacted various potential lenders regarding a refinancing of MoneyGram’s debt.
Also in the spring of 2019, MoneyGram engaged in preliminary merger and financing discussions with a consortium of domestic and foreign investors,
referred to as the Consortium, introduced to MoneyGram by a representative of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (“THL”), MoneyGram’s largest stockholder
at the time.
On April 19, 2019, MoneyGram received a preliminary non-binding proposal from a strategic competitor, referred to as Party B, to acquire MoneyGram for
$5.00 per share, a 106% premium to MoneyGram’s closing stock price of $2.43 on April 18, 2019. Party B’s proposal also included a conditional offer to
provide a partial refinancing of MoneyGram’s debt in the form of second lien notes. However, discussions between MoneyGram and Party B ceased in
April 2019 as MoneyGram began to move forward with its refinancing process.
On May 3, 2019, the Consortium sent MoneyGram a draft non-binding term sheet providing for an acquisition of MoneyGram for $4.25 per share, a 35%
premium to MoneyGram’s closing stock price of $3.14 on May 2, 2019. However, discussions between MoneyGram and the Consortium ceased as
MoneyGram began to finalize its refinancing process.
In June 2019, MoneyGram successfully refinanced its debt and entered into a new three-year revolving credit facility, a four-year first lien term loan
facility and a five-year second lien term loan facility. In connection with the refinancing, MoneyGram issued warrants to the second lien lenders
facility and a five-year second lien term loan facility. In connection with the refinancing, MoneyGram issued warrants to the second lien lenders
exercisable at $0.01 per share for an aggregate of 5,423,470 shares of MoneyGram Common Stock (or approximately 7% of MoneyGram’s then fully diluted
outstanding Common Stock). Also in June 2019, MoneyGram entered into an agreement with Ripple Labs Inc. (“Ripple”) pursuant to which Ripple
committed to purchase up to $50 million of shares of MoneyGram Common Stock and warrants at a price of $4.10 per share (or per share underlying each
warrant). Ripple purchased $30 million of such shares of Common Stock and warrants in June 2019 and the remaining $20 million in November 2019.
In the summer of 2019, following the completion of MoneyGram’s refinancing, MoneyGram reengaged in preliminary merger discussions with Party B and
the Consortium.

Table of Contents
On August 9, 2019, MoneyGram received a non-binding proposal letter from the Consortium to acquire MoneyGram for $4.25 per share, a 38% premium to
MoneyGram’s closing stock price of $3.08 on August 8, 2019. However, discussions with the Consortium ended in September 2019 primarily due to
regulatory concerns and valuation issues.
In the fall of 2019, discussions with Party B ceased primarily due to regulatory concerns and valuation issues.
In November 2019, funds affiliated with THL, which collectively held over 30% of MoneyGram’s Common Stock on an as-converted basis at the time,
distributed substantially all of their shares of MoneyGram Common Stock to certain THL limited partners and to the general partner and affiliated entities
of THL, resulting in MoneyGram no longer being treated as a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules.
On February 25, 2020, MoneyGram and the Department agreed to extend the due date for the remaining $55 million payment under the DPA to November
8, 2020.
In February and March 2020, in connection with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, MoneyGram’s stock price declined along with most of the rest of
the U.S. equity markets, reaching a multi-year low closing price of $1.18 per share on April 1, 2020.
On April 9, 2020, MoneyGram received an unsolicited non-binding proposal from Party B to acquire MoneyGram for $3.00 per share, a 108% premium to
MoneyGram’s closing stock price of $1.44 on April 9, 2020.
During the spring and summer of 2020, MoneyGram and Party B reengaged in discussions to further analyze the regulatory risks of a combination of the
two companies. However, discussions ultimately ceased in the summer of 2020 due to the view of both MoneyGram and Party B that a merger between
the two parties was unlikely to be approved by regulatory authorities.
On July 24, 2020, MoneyGram and the Department agreed to further extend the due date for the remaining $55 million payment under the DPA to May 9,
2021.
On July 28, 2020, our board of directors adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the “Tax Benefits Preservation Plan”), which placed certain restrictions
on stockholders acquiring more than 5% of MoneyGram’s Common Stock in order to prevent an inadvertent “ownership change” as defined in Section
382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in order to preserve certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
In August and September 2020, affiliates of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“GS”), which collectively held one of the largest positions of MoneyGram
Common Stock at the time with an over 10% as-converted ownership percentage, sold their position in MoneyGram, further decreasing the concentration
of MoneyGram’s stockholder base.
On March 17, 2021, MoneyGram received a non-binding proposal to acquire MoneyGram for $9.50 per share from a private equity firm, referred to as Party
C, a 33% premium to MoneyGram’s closing stock price of $7.16 on March 16, 2021.
On March 24, 2021, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and V&E,
outside counsel to MoneyGram, to discuss Party C’s non-binding proposal. Following discussion, our board of directors determined that prior to
engaging further with Party C, MoneyGram would attend to certain near-term commercial matters, including the expected termination of the DPA and
MoneyGram’s planned debt refinancing to take advantage of historically low interest rates and to
38
Table of Contents
lessen MoneyGram’s interest expense burden. MoneyGram so advised Party C that it intended to attend to such other matters. Also during this meeting,
representatives of V&E provided our board of directors with an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties and general process and procedural
considerations in the context of receiving an acquisition proposal.
In May 2021, MoneyGram made the final $55 million payment under the DPA.
On May 21, 2021, a representative of a private equity firm, referred to as Party D, contacted Mr. Holmes to request a meeting.
On May 24, 2021, Mr. Holmes and other members of management met with the representative of Party D via videoconference. During this meeting, the
representative of Party D stated that Party D was interested in a potential transaction with MoneyGram and requested that the parties sign a
confidentiality agreement to facilitate further discussions.
On May 26, 2021, MoneyGram and Party D entered into a confidentiality agreement, which contained a customary standstill restriction but did not
preclude Party D from submitting a private proposal to our board of directors at any time. Following the execution of the confidentiality agreement, Party
D was given access to an online data room hosted by MoneyGram. Party D also engaged in a series of preliminary discussions with representatives of
MoneyGram between May 26 and June 24, 2021, after which discussions between the parties ceased prior to Party D giving any indication of a valuation
of MoneyGram.
Also in May 2021, MoneyGram’s stock price exceeded the price proposed in Party C’s non-binding proposal submitted on March 17, 2021 and no further
discussions were held between the parties.
On June 3, 2021, our board of directors terminated the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan.
On June 10, 2021, the charges filed by the Department under the DPA were dismissed and the DPA was officially terminated.
In connection with considering the range of outcomes relative to refinancing its long-term debt and reducing its cost of capital, based on the
recommendation of BofA Securities and our management, our board of directors determined that MoneyGram should first raise new equity to partially
reduce its outstanding debt and leverage ratios. On June 18, 2021, MoneyGram completed an at-the-market equity offering, raising $99.8 million in gross
proceeds through the sale of approximately 10.4 million shares of MoneyGram Common Stock at an average price of $9.56 per share, the proceeds of
which were primarily used to prepay a portion of MoneyGram’s second lien debt.
On July 15, 2021, the Financial Times (the “Financial Times”) published an article reporting a rumor that a private equity firm was considering an offer to
acquire MoneyGram. However, MoneyGram did not receive an acquisition proposal during this period.
On July 21, 2021, MoneyGram announced a successful refinancing of its debt through the closing of a private offering of $415 million of senior secured
notes and a $400 million senior secured term loan, the proceeds of which were used to prepay the full remaining amount of MoneyGram’s first and second
lien debt. Following the publication of the Financial Times article and the announcement of MoneyGram’s successful refinancing, MoneyGram’s stock
price closed at a new multi-year high of $12.04 on July 22, 2021.
In the Fall of 2021, a representative of a private equity firm, referred to as Party E, contacted a representative of BofA Securities regarding Party E’s
potential interest in engaging in transaction discussions with MoneyGram.
39
Table of Contents
On October 19, 2021, Vahe A. Dombalagian, a managing director at MDP, contacted a representative of BofA Securities to request a reintroduction to Mr.
Holmes to discuss MDP’s potential interest in a transaction with MoneyGram.
On October 20, 2021, MoneyGram and MDP entered into a confidentiality agreement, which contained a customary standstill restriction but did not
preclude MDP from submitting a private proposal to our board of directors at any time. Following the execution of the confidentiality agreement, MDP
was given access to the online data room hosted by MoneyGram and engaged in due diligence discussions with representatives of MoneyGram.
On November 5, 2021, members of MoneyGram management met with Mr. Dombalagian and other representatives of MDP at MoneyGram’s headquarters
in Dallas, Texas, during which MDP discussed its potential interest in pursuing an acquisition of MoneyGram. MDP representatives gave no indication of
valuation during these discussions.
Later on November 5, 2021, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and a representative of BofA Securities, to
discuss, among other things, the recent discussions with MDP. During this meeting, Mr. Holmes explained to our board of directors that discussions with
MDP were preliminary and that MDP had not provided an indication of value or indicated whether it would submit an acquisition proposal. Mr. Holmes
also explained that a representative of Party E had contacted BofA Securities regarding a potential transaction with MoneyGram but such discussions
had not advanced past a preliminary stage. Mr. Holmes further noted that MoneyGram had previously engaged in separate conversations regarding an
acquisition of MoneyGram with each of MDP and Party E during the 2019 sale process, but the discussions did not advance past a preliminary stage at
such time.
Between November 5 and 16, 2021, MoneyGram engaged in continued preliminary discussions with MDP.
On November 11, 2021, a representative of a MoneyGram institutional stockholder introduced Mr. Holmes to a representative of a private equity firm,
referred to as Party F.
On November 16, 2021, Mr. Dombalagian called Mr. Holmes to notify him that MDP intended to submit a non-binding proposal to acquire MoneyGram.
On November 17, 2021, Mr. Dombalagian emailed Mr. Holmes a non-binding proposal to acquire MoneyGram for $10.00 per share, a 60% premium to
MoneyGram’s closing stock price of $6.25 on November 16, 2021, which included a request for a 30-day exclusive negotiating period between
MoneyGram and MDP.
On November 19, 2021, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and
V&E, to discuss MDP’s proposal. During the meeting, our board of directors instructed management to remain engaged with MDP but not to grant MDP
exclusivity. Our board of directors also instructed BofA Securities to contact additional potential buyers to determine whether a transaction may be
available that would be in the best interests of MoneyGram stockholders. Also during this meeting, representatives of V&E provided our board of
directors with an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties and general process and procedural considerations in the context of receiving an acquisition
proposal.
Also on November 19, 2021, members of MoneyGram management met with representatives of Party F to engage in a high-level discussion of
MoneyGram’s business.
In late November 2021, following the direction given by our board of directors at the board meeting on November 19, 2021, BofA Securities began
contacting potentially interested buyers. During the course of November and December 2021, BofA Securities contacted 33 parties (including MDP, Party
C, Party D, Party E,
40
Table of Contents
Party F and a private equity firm, referred to as Party G), consisting of 20 financial parties and 13 strategic parties. Of the 33 contacted parties, 17 parties
(including 13 financial parties and 4 strategic parties) entered into confidentiality agreements with MoneyGram and 15 parties (including 11 financial
parties and 4 strategic parties) engaged in management presentations or discussions with MoneyGram regarding a potential transaction. The
confidentiality agreements between MoneyGram and each interested party described below included a customary standstill provision, but none of them
precluded an interested party from making a private proposal to our board of directors at any time. BofA Securities, at the direction of our board of
directors, did not contact certain strategic parties, including Party B, due to competitive and regulatory concerns.
On December 2, 2021, a representative of Party D, who had previously been contacted by representatives of BofA Securities, contacted Mr. Holmes to
express an interest in commencing potential acquisition discussions. Later that day, MoneyGram and Party D entered into a new confidentiality
agreement, which was substantially similar to the confidentiality agreement entered into between the parties on May 26, 2021, including with respect to its
standstill provision.
On December 7, 2021, members of MoneyGram management and representatives of BofA Securities met with Mr. Dombalagian and other representatives
of MDP at MoneyGram’s headquarters in Dallas, Texas. During this meeting, the parties discussed MoneyGram’s business performance, background, and
other related matters.
On December 8, 2021, our board of directors held a regular meeting, a portion of which was attended by members of management and representatives of
BofA Securities and V&E to discuss the outreach to potential buyers by BofA Securities. During this portion of the meeting, representatives of V&E
reviewed with the members of our board of directors their fiduciary duties in connection with evaluating a potential strategic transaction and responding
to any formal proposals that our board of directors may receive with respect to a sale of MoneyGram or other strategic transaction.
On December 9, 2021, Party F notified representatives of BofA Securities that it would not further pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram.
Between December 10 and 14, 2021, at the direction of our board of directors, BofA Securities sent letters to the 10 parties that appeared most interested
in pursuing an acquisition of MoneyGram, including MDP, Party C, Party D and Party E, requesting the submission of non-binding proposals to acquire
MoneyGram by December 21, 2021.
On December 13, 2021, MoneyGram entered into a confidentiality agreement with a domestic strategic party, referred to as Party H, who was a member of
the Consortium that engaged in preliminary merger discussions with MoneyGram in 2019. The confidentiality agreement contained a customary standstill
restriction but did not preclude Party H from submitting a private proposal to our board of directors at any time. Party H indicated that it would likely not
be in a position to acquire all of MoneyGram but that it may desire to act as a co-bidder with another potential buyer. Accordingly, the confidentiality
agreement allowed Party H to act as a co-bidder with certain parties or with MoneyGram’s consent.
On December 15, 2021, Reuters reported that MDP had submitted a proposal to acquire MoneyGram. That same day, following the release of this story,
MoneyGram’s stock price closed up 8.2% from the prior day’s close. From December 14, 2021, the trading day prior to publication of the Reuters story,
through February 11, 2022, the trading day prior to the signing of the merger agreement with MDP, MoneyGram’s stock price significantly outperformed
the stock prices of certain key competitors and the broader market generally, rising 17.4% during such period whereas the S&P 500 index declined by
4.6%.
Also on December 15, 2021, representatives of MDP orally communicated to MoneyGram a willingness to increase MDP’s proposed price to $10.50 per
share, an increase from the $10.00 per share set forth in MDP’s proposal letter submitted on November 17, 2021.
41

Further on December 15, 2021, Party A contacted representatives of BofA Securities to express an interest in engaging in transaction discussions with
MoneyGram, citing the Reuters article published earlier that day.
On December 16, 2021, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and
V&E, to discuss MDP’s willingness to increase its proposed price and the status of discussions with other potential buyers. During this meeting, our
board of directors expressed support for continuing discussions with interested parties to determine whether a transaction may be available that would
be in the best interests of MoneyGram stockholders.
On December 20, 2021, at the direction of our board of directors, BofA Securities sent a letter to Party A, requesting the submission of a non-binding
proposal to acquire MoneyGram by December 21, 2021.
On December 21, 2021, MoneyGram received two additional non-binding proposals: one from Party D at a price of $10.00 to $11.00 per share and another
from Party G at a price of $9.75 to $10.25 per share. On that same day, a representative of a private equity firm, referred to as Party I, contacted a
representative of BofA Securities regarding Party I’s potential interest in engaging in transaction discussions with MoneyGram, citing the Reuters article
published on December 15, 2021.
Also on December 21, 2021, Party E notified representatives of BofA Securities that it would not further pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram.
On December 22, 2021, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and
V&E, to discuss the proposals received from MDP, Party D and Party G and the status of other potentially interested buyers. During this meeting, our
board of directors instructed management and BofA Securities to continue to engage with all remaining interested buyers in an effort to identify the best
potential transaction that could be obtained for MoneyGram’s stockholders.
Also on December 22, 2021, Party C notified representatives of BofA Securities that it would not further pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram.
On December 23, 2021, MoneyGram received a non-binding proposal from Party A at a price of $8.75 to $10.75 per share.
On December 30, 2021, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and
V&E, to discuss the status of discussions with the remaining interested parties. During this meeting, representatives of BofA Securities presented to our
board of directors preliminary financial analyses related to the valuation of MoneyGram, which materials utilized financial projections prepared by
MoneyGram management.
On January 3, 2022, MoneyGram posted a draft form merger agreement for MDP, Party A and Party D and Party G to the online data room hosted by
MoneyGram. The draft merger agreement included, among other things, (i) a 30-day post-signing period during which MoneyGram could continue to
actively solicit acquisition proposals from other parties and terminate the merger agreement for a lower termination fee (the “Go-Shop Provision”) and (ii)
a reverse termination fee payable by buyer in the event the transaction did not close due to the failure to receive certain money transmitter license change
of control approvals, regardless of whether such failure was the fault of buyer (the “MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee”).
In late December 2021 and early January 2022, representatives of MoneyGram and BofA Securities continued to engage in discussions with interested
buyers, including two strategic parties who had previously executed confidentiality agreements during the process, referred to as Party J and Party K.
On January 7, 2022, Party G notified representatives of BofA Securities that it would not further pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram.
42
Table of Contents
By January 9, 2022, all parties contacted by BofA Securities since the beginning of the process, other than MDP and Parties A, D, H, I, J and K, had
declined to pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram. Parties H, I, J and K, however, had not submitted an acquisition proposal.
Also on January 10, 2022, at the direction of our board of directors, BofA Securities sent letters to MDP, Party A and Party D requesting definitive
acquisition proposals from such parties by January 24, 2022.
On January 12, 2022, Party I notified representatives of BofA Securities that it would not further pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram.
On January 13, 2022, at the direction of our board of directors, BofA Securities sent a letter to Party K requesting an initial indication of interest by
January 19, 2022. Party J was not sent a letter because it did not appear interested in further pursuing an acquisition of MoneyGram at the time.
On January 14, 2022, MDP sent an updated proposal letter, increasing its proposed price to $10.50 per share, confirming its oral indication from December
15, 2021. The proposal letter stated that MDP’s proposal would expire on January 25, 2022 unless MoneyGram granted MDP exclusivity on or prior to
such date. MDP’s proposal letter also indicated that MDP expected to finish its diligence during the week of January 17, 2022. MDP also submitted a
markup of the merger agreement, as well as initial drafts of equity and debt commitment letters and a draft limited guarantee. MDP’s merger agreement
markup, among other things, (i) removed the Go-Shop Provision, (ii) removed the MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee, (iii) included a reimbursement
by MoneyGram of up to $10 million of MDP’s expenses if the merger agreement was terminated due to the failure to obtain MoneyGram stockholder
approval (the “Expense Fee”), (iv) included a broad definition of “burdensome condition,” which set limitations on the actions buyer would be required to
take under the merger agreement to obtain regulatory approvals, including money transmitter license approvals and (v) proposed a MoneyGram
termination fee in the amount of 3.50% of MoneyGram’s equity value as of the signing of a merger agreement, which would be payable in the event
MoneyGram entered into an agreement with another buyer, our board of directors changed its recommendation or in certain other circumstances.
Also on January 14, 2022, Party D contacted BofA Securities to seek permission from MoneyGram to make a co-bid with Party H. Later that day,
MoneyGram granted its consent for Party D making a co-bid with Party H.
On January 18, 2022, Party J notified representatives of BofA Securities that it would not further pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram.
On January 20, 2022, Party K notified representatives of BofA Securities that it would not further pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram.
On January 24, 2022, Party A notified representatives of BofA Securities that it would not further pursue an acquisition of MoneyGram.
Also on January 24, 2022, Latham & Watkins, outside counsel for MDP, on behalf of MDP, sent V&E an updated markup of the merger agreement
reflecting certain changes from MDP’s markup submitted on January 14, 2022, including a proposed buyer termination fee amount of 5.0% of
MoneyGram’s equity value as of the signing of a merger agreement. During this time, MDP continued to indicate its desire to sign a definitive merger
agreement as soon as possible, noting that its diligence was complete. MDP also communicated orally that it might be willing to increase its proposed
price from $10.50 per share but did not specify an exact price.
On the morning of January 25, 2022, Reuters reported that MDP and two other private equity firms had submitted competing offers to acquire
MoneyGram.

Table of Contents
In the afternoon of January 25, 2022, Parties D and H submitted a joint non-binding proposal letter to acquire MoneyGram for $11.00 per share. Under the
proposal, Party D was to be the primary bidder with Party H providing a certain amount of equity financing for the acquisition. Along with the proposal,
Party D indicated that it would need at least four more weeks of diligence before it could be in a position to sign a merger agreement and that the proposal
could be revised or withdrawn based on the outcome of such diligence. Parties D and H also submitted a markup of the merger agreement, as well as
initial drafts of equity and debt commitment letters and draft limited guarantees. The merger agreement markup, among other things, (i) removed the Go-
Shop Provision, (ii) removed the MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee, (iii) included a buyer reverse termination fee in the amount of 5.0% of
MoneyGram’s equity value as of the signing of a merger agreement and (iv) broadened the “burdensome condition” definition from MoneyGram’s draft
merger agreement.
Later in the afternoon of January 25, 2022, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of
BofA Securities and V&E, to discuss the proposals received from MDP and Parties D and H. During this meeting, our board of directors expressed
disappointment that Party D would need at least four more weeks of diligence before signing a merger agreement and the fact that the proposal by Parties
D and H could be revised or withdrawn based on the outcome of such diligence, noting that this gave MoneyGram little certainty that such parties would
ultimately transact at a price of $11.00 per share or otherwise. Observing that MDP’s latest proposal expired on the day of the meeting, our board of
directors instructed BofA Securities to ask MDP for more time to evaluate MDP’s proposal and to ask Party D to expedite its timeline to signing a merger
agreement. Also at this meeting, representatives of BofA Securities presented to our board of directors an updated version of its preliminary financial
analyses related to the valuation of MoneyGram, which analyses utilized the financial projections prepared by MoneyGram management and more fully
described under “The Merger—Unaudited Financial Projections of MoneyGram.”
During the next several days, representatives of MoneyGram and BofA Securities continued to engage in discussions with MDP and Parties D and H.
On January 26, 2022, MoneyGram and MDP and their respective advisors held several video conferences during which the parties discussed the material
terms in MDP’s proposed draft of the merger agreement. During these discussions, MDP indicated a willingness to accept a Go-Shop Provision with a
“two-tiered” MoneyGram termination fee with a 50% lower termination fee payable if the merger agreement were terminated by MoneyGram to accept an
offer received during the “go-shop” period, so long as the termination fee for a termination to accept an offer received during the “go-shop” period from
certain types of parties that had expressed interest prior to signing was only slightly lower than MoneyGram’s regular post-“go-shop” period termination
fee.
On January 28, 2022, V&E, on behalf of MoneyGram, sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Latham & Watkins, along with revised drafts of the
equity commitment letter and limited guarantee. The draft merger agreement, among other things, (i) reinserted the Go-Shop Provision, (ii) reinserted the
MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee, (iii) removed the Expense Fee, (iv) included a buyer termination fee amount of 7.50% of MoneyGram’s equity
value as of the signing of the merger agreement, (v) included a MoneyGram termination fee amount of 3.00% of MoneyGram’s equity value as of the
signing of a merger agreement, except for a termination in accordance with the Go-Shop Provision, in which case the termination fee amount would equal
1.50% of MoneyGram’s equity value as of signing or, in the case of a termination for a transaction with certain types of parties that had expressed interest
prior to signing, 2.75% of MoneyGram’s equity value as of signing, and (vi) generally reinserted the “burdensome condition” definition from
MoneyGram’s initial draft.
On the morning of January 29, 2022, Mr. Dombalagian contacted Mr. Holmes and representatives of BofA Securities to communicate MDP’s
disappointment in the merger agreement markup, particularly with respect to the reinsertion of the MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee and the
narrowing of the “burdensome condition” definition.

Table of Contents
On the evening of January 29, 2022, V&E, on behalf of MoneyGram, following a discussion with representatives of MoneyGram, BofA Securities and Paul
Hastings, financial services regulatory counsel to MoneyGram, earlier that afternoon, sent an updated markup of the merger agreement to Latham &
Watkins, reflecting minor broadening of the “burdensome condition” definition.
On the morning of January 30, 2022, representatives of MoneyGram, MDP, V&E, Latham & Watkins and Paul Hastings had a phone call to discuss certain
outstanding items in the merger agreement. During this call, MDP indicated a willingness to (i) accept the reinsertion of the Go-Shop Provision, (ii) accept
the reinsertion of the MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee, but with a termination fee amount of $30 million, (iii) accept the removal of the Expense
Fee, (iv) accept MoneyGram’s proposed amounts for the MoneyGram termination fee, including upon a termination in accordance with the Go-Shop
Provision, and (v) propose certain compromises on the “burdensome condition” definition.
On the evening of January 30, 2022, V&E, on behalf of MoneyGram, sent a revised draft of the merger agreement, along with revised drafts of the equity
commitment letters and limited guarantees, to counsel for Party D. The draft merger agreement, among other things, (i) reinserted the Go-Shop Provision,
(ii) reinserted the MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee, (iii) included a buyer termination fee amount of 7.50% of MoneyGram’s equity value as of the
signing of the merger agreement and (iv) generally reinserted the “burdensome condition” definition from MoneyGram’s initial draft. Party D did not
respond to the revised drafts.
On January 31, 2022, Mr. Dombalagian called Mr. Holmes to notify him that MDP would increase its proposal to $11.00 per share, subject to MoneyGram
granting MDP seven days of exclusivity.
On February 1, 2022, Latham & Watkins, at the direction of MDP, sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to V&E, which, among other things, (i)
generally accepted MoneyGram’s reinsertion of the Go-Shop Provision but excluded certain types of parties that had expressed interest prior to signing
from the go-shop process entirely, (ii) accepted the MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee, (iii) accepted the removal of the Expense Fee, (iv) proposed a
buyer termination fee of 6.0% of MoneyGram’s equity value as of signing, other than in the case of an MTL Approval Reverse Termination Fee, in which
case such fee would be $30 million, (v) accepted MoneyGram’s proposed amounts for the MoneyGram termination fee, including upon a termination in
accordance with the Go-Shop Provision, and (vi) slightly broadened the scope of the “burdensome condition” definition.
On February 2, 2022, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and V&E,
to discuss the status of discussions with MDP and Parties D and H. During this meeting, members of management and BofA Securities communicated to
our board of directors that based on discussions with Party D the previous day, Party D was still not willing to expedite its timeline to signing a definitive
agreement and there was substantial doubt that Party D would in fact make a definitive proposal at the end of that period. In light of such discussions
and the fact that MDP indicated a willingness to increase its proposal to $11.00 per share if granted exclusivity, our board of directors approved granting
MDP seven days of exclusivity so long as MDP accepted a Go-Shop Provision that did not exclude certain types of parties that had expressed interest
prior to signing from such process. In addition, BofA Securities reviewed with our board of directors its preliminary financial analyses related to the
valuation of MoneyGram, which were substantially the same as the preliminary financial analyses reviewed at the meeting of our board of directors on
January 25, 2022. Also during this meeting, our board of directors, with V&E, compared the legal terms currently proposed by both MDP and Parties D
and H. Our board of directors expressed general support for the terms negotiated with MDP.
Following the meeting of our board of directors on February 2, 2022, Mr. Holmes called Mr. Dombalagian to notify him that MoneyGram was willing to
grant MDP seven days of exclusivity so long as MDP accepted a Go-Shop Provision that did not exclude certain types of parties that had expressed
interest prior to signing from such process. Mr. Dombalagian accepted this position.

Table of Contents
On February 3, 2022, MoneyGram and MDP executed an exclusivity agreement, which provided that MoneyGram would negotiate exclusively with MDP
until February 10, 2022.
From February 3 through February 10, 2022, MoneyGram and MDP engaged in continued discussions regarding a transaction, and V&E and Latham &
Watkins exchanged several drafts of the merger agreement and related documents in an attempt to finalize acquisition terms.
On February 10, 2022, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and
V&E, to discuss the latest negotiations with MDP. During this meeting, members of management and BofA Securities communicated to our board of
directors that discussions with MDP remained ongoing and that both MDP and MoneyGram continued to work towards finalizing transaction terms. Our
board of directors approved extending exclusivity with MDP for an additional seven days. In addition, BofA Securities again reviewed with our board of
directors its preliminary financial analyses related to the valuation of MoneyGram. Following the meeting, MoneyGram and MDP executed an exclusivity
agreement extension, extending the exclusivity term to February 17, 2022.
From February 10 through February 14, 2022, MoneyGram and MDP and their respective advisors continued to work to finalize the terms of the
transaction documents.
On February 14, 2022, our board of directors held a special meeting, attended by members of management and representatives of BofA Securities and
V&E. During the meeting, our board of directors, with V&E, reviewed the final material terms of the proposed merger agreement and related documents,
which are more fully described under “The Merger Agreement.” Also at this meeting, BofA Securities reviewed with our board of directors its financial
analyses of the merger consideration, which were substantially the same as the financial analyses reviewed at the meeting of our board of directors on
February 10, 2022, and delivered to our board of directors an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
February 14, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger
consideration to be received by holders of our Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion
of BofA Securities is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. See also “The
Merger—Opinion of MoneyGram’s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration.” Following the presentations and discussion, the members of
our board of directors present at the meeting unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and the merger, and unanimously resolved to
recommend that MoneyGram stockholders vote to approve the merger. In connection with this board meeting, BofA Securities furnished a customary
relationship disclosure memorandum to our board of directors.
On February 15, 2022, prior to the opening of trading of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq, the parties executed the merger agreement and issued a joint
press release announcing the transaction.
On February 17, 2022, in accordance with the Go-Shop Provision in the merger agreement, BofA Securities, on behalf of MoneyGram, began contacting
parties to gauge interest in whether any other buyer would be willing to acquire MoneyGram at a higher price than MDP. BofA Securities ultimately
contacted 39 new parties, including 21 financial parties and 18 strategic parties, and 4 parties that had previously been contacted by BofA Securities in
December 2021, including 3 financial parties and 1 strategic party. Of such contacted parties, two strategic parties and one private equity firm executed a
confidentiality agreement, which included a customary standstill provision but did not preclude such party from making a private proposal to our board
of directors at any time, and all other parties declined to pursue discussions with MoneyGram. MoneyGram granted access to an online data room to the
three parties that executed confidentiality agreements. However, none of the three parties submitted an acquisition proposal.
On March 16, 2022, at 11:59 p.m. Central Time, the 30-day go-shop period ended without any party submitting a proposal to acquire MoneyGram.

MONEYGRAM INTERNATIONAL INC_20220421_DEFM14A_20027475_4446252.Pdf,Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of Our Board of Directors,"Reasons for the Merger and the Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
At a meeting of our board of directors held on February 14, 2022, our board of directors approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of MoneyGram vote “for” the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the Merger.
In the course of reaching its decision, our board of directors consulted with our senior management and our financial and legal advisors, reviewed a
significant amount of information and considered a number of factors, including, among others, the following (which factors are not necessarily
presented in order of relative importance), each of which our board of directors believed supported its determination and recommendation:
•
Merger Consideration. Our board of directors considered that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration provides
stockholders with the best value reasonably obtainable for their shares of MoneyGram Common Stock. Specifically, our board of directors
considered:
o
the fact that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration represented a premium of approximately (i) 50% to $7.34,
the closing price of our Common Stock on December 14, 2021, the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a possible
transaction, (ii) 28% to $8.62, the closing price on February 11, 2022, the last trading day prior to the approval by our board of
directors of the Merger, and (iii) 56% to the volume-weighted average trading price of $7.04 for the 90-day period ended December 14,
2021, the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a possible transaction;
o
the belief of our board of directors that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration was the highest price per
share that MDP was willing to agree to pay, particularly in light of the fact that MDP had twice increased its proposed price in the
course of its negotiations with MoneyGram (as more fully described in “The Merger—Background of the Merger”), and the view of
our board of directors as to the likelihood that any third party would be willing to pay more to acquire MoneyGram on the same or
substantially similar terms; and
o
the fact that the Merger Consideration would be paid solely in cash, without a financing contingency, which, compared to non-cash
consideration, provides certainty and immediate liquidity and value to our stockholders and does not expose them to any future risks
related to the business or the financial markets generally, in each case upon and assuming closing of the Merger.
•
Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value After a Thorough Sale Process. Our board of directors considered its assessment as
to the possibility that a third party with sufficient financial means would agree to a transaction at a higher price than MDP on similar or more
favorable terms, given the fact that the Merger is the result of an extensive sale process conducted by BofA Securities, during which BofA
Securities contacted 13 potential strategic acquirers and 20 financial acquirers (including MDP) concerning their interest in an acquisition of
MoneyGram and of these only MDP and three other parties made a proposal and only MDP submitted a final bid. In addition, while the sale
and extensive due diligence process was conducted privately, several media stories were published regarding MDP’s proposals to acquire
MoneyGram, making it more likely, in the view of our board of directors, that potential acquirers with serious interest in acquiring
MoneyGram who had not been contacted by BofA Securities would still be aware of the potential for a sale and would have approached
MoneyGram. In addition to the thorough sales process we conducted prior to signing the Merger Agreement, our board of directors also
considered the additional opportunities potential acquirers would have to participate in a go-shop process following signing, more fully
described under “—Merger Agreement” below. MoneyGram’s sale process is more fully described in “The Merger—Background of the
Merger.”

•
Risks associated with continued independence. Our board of directors considered the risks associated with continued independence,
including:
o
risks associated with operating in a highly competitive industry, including that some of our competitors have larger market share,
more established customer bases and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have, and the risks that
other third parties with more resources, including certain of MoneyGram’s agents, may enter the marketplace in the future;
o
risks associated with operating in a rapidly changing competitive landscape in the payments industry, which includes competing
disruptive digital technologies;
o
risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry, including with respect to laws and regulations intended to prevent
consumer fraud, money laundering and terrorism financing, the high ongoing compliance costs associated with operating in such
industry, and the possibility of litigation or investigations involving us or our agents;
o
risks associated with our reliance on key agents and markets;
o
risks associated with our indebtedness, including our debt service obligations, debt covenant requirements and our below
“investment grade” credit ratings;
o
risks associated with the uncertainties relating to inflation on MoneyGram’s business, cost structure and operations and other factors
affecting global economic activity;
o
risks associated with any potential outbreak, continuation or escalation of war or hostilities (including the potential conflict in
Ukraine);
o
risks associated with ongoing efforts and uncertainty relating to COVID-19; and
o
other risks and uncertainties discussed in MoneyGram’s public filings with the SEC.
•
MoneyGram’s current condition and future prospects. Our board of directors considered information with respect to our financial
condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and business strategy on a historical and prospective basis, as well as
current industry, economic and market conditions and trends. Our board of directors also considered the potential future value of
MoneyGram, together with the risks associated with continued independence discussed above, as compared to the value of the Merger
Consideration.
•
Opinion of MoneyGram’s Financial Advisor. Our board of directors considered the opinion provided by BofA Securities, dated February
14, 2022, to our board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of our Common Stock, as more fully described in the subsection entitled “The Merger—Opinion of
MoneyGram’s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration.” The full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement.
•
Characteristics of MDP. Our board of directors considered the business reputation and capabilities of MDP and its management, MDP’s
experience executing acquisitions, the resources available to MDP to complete the Merger and the strong commercial incentives and
motivations of MDP to timely obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and complete the Merger.
•
Financing. Our board of directors considered the terms of the committed debt financing obtained by Merger Sub from major commercial
banks with significant experience in similar lending transactions and strong reputations for honoring their commitments and the terms of the
committed equity financing provided by affiliated funds of MDP, including the nature and limited number of the conditions to the debt
financing and equity financing, the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to use their reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to the
equity financing and debt financing and the fact that the committed equity financing is in an amount that, together with the committed debt
financing, would be sufficient to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
48
Table of Contents
•
Likelihood of consummation. Our board of directors considered the likelihood that the Merger would be completed in light of, among other
things, the conditions to the Merger and the absence of a financing condition, the absence of any condition related to the receipt of third
party commercial consents or approvals, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals prior to the end date (after giving
effect to any extension thereof already provided for in the Merger Agreement), Parent’s representations and warranties relating to the equity
commitment letter, the debt commitment letter and Parent’s solvency, and the remedies available to us under the Merger Agreement in the
event of various breaches by Parent, including the Limited Guarantee discussed below. Our board of directors also considered its belief that
Parent should, in particular, be incentivized to take considerable efforts to obtain necessary approvals from money transmitter license
regulators in light of the $30 million reverse termination fee payable by Parent following the termination of the Merger Agreement in
specified circumstances when the required money transfer approvals have not been obtained.
•
Negotiation Process. Our board of directors considered that the terms of the Merger Agreement were the result of robust arm’s-length
negotiations conducted by MoneyGram, with the knowledge and at the direction of our board of directors and with the assistance of our
legal and financial advisors.
•
Merger Agreement. Our board of directors considered the terms of the Merger Agreement, including:
o
the representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger and
their ability to terminate the Merger Agreement;
o
Parent’s undertakings in furtherance of obtaining required regulatory approvals and the fact that the consummation of the Merger
Agreement is (i) conditioned on obtaining only the required money transfer approvals (in addition to certain other approvals as more
fully described in “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger), as more further described in “The Merger—
Regulatory Matters,” and not all approvals related to money transmitter licenses and (ii) not conditioned on obtaining the consent of
any third party under commercial agreements;
o
the end date (after giving effect to any extension thereof already provided for in the Merger Agreement) under the Merger Agreement
on which either party, subject to certain exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement and the belief of our board of directors that
such end date allows for sufficient time to consummate the Merger;
o
the obligation of Parent under certain circumstances to pay us a termination fee of:
•
$65.5 million, in connection with any failure to consummate the Merger if the relevant conditions are satisfied and in certain
circumstances following a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, as more fully described in “The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fees and Expenses”; and
•
$30 million, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances when the required
money transmitter approvals have not been obtained;
o
the Guarantors’ obligation to guarantee Parent’s payment of any termination fee payable under the Merger Agreement, along with
certain other obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, and the fact that MoneyGram has no obligation to
seek payment from Parent prior to seeking to recover from the Guarantors;
o
the right of MoneyGram and our board of directors to actively solicit offers with respect to acquisition proposals during a 30-day go-
shop period and terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal during the go-shop
period and for a period of 20 days thereafter, subject to Parent’s right to receive payment of a termination fee of (A) $16.4 million if the
counterparty did not submit a bid or proposal or take certain other actions during the 180 days prior to execution of the Merger
Agreement or (B) $30.0 million if the counterparty did submit a bid or proposal or take certain other actions during the 180 days prior
to execution of the Merger Agreement;
49
Table of Contents
o
the right of MoneyGram and our board of directors to entertain certain unsolicited acquisition proposals after the go-shop period and
terminate the Merger Agreement prior to receipt of stockholder approval to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior
proposal, subject to Parent’s right to receive payment of a termination fee of $32.8 million;
o
the belief of our board of directors that, although the no solicitation covenant, termination fee provisions and Parent’s right to match
any superior proposal might have the effect of discouraging competing third-party proposals or reducing the price of such proposals,
such provisions are customary for transactions of this size and type, and its belief that the termination fee was reasonable in the
context of comparable transactions, particularly given the discussions with certain other potential bidders that we held in advance of
the execution of the Merger Agreement, as more fully described in “The Merger—Background of the Merger”;
o
the right of our board of directors to change its recommendation prior to receipt of stockholder approval, subject to certain
restrictions, in connection with a superior proposal or other circumstances in which our board of directors determines the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
o
the right of MoneyGram, under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of Parent’s
obligation to cause, and, pursuant to the equity commitment letters, to seek specific performance to directly cause, the equity
financing sources to fund their contributions as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the equity commitment letter.
•
Opportunity for MoneyGram Stockholders to Vote. Our board of directors considered the fact that the Merger would be subject to the
approval of MoneyGram’s stockholders, and that MoneyGram’s stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against
the adoption of the Merger Agreement at MoneyGram’s stockholder meeting.
•
Current economic and political conditions. Our board of directors considered the current state of the economy, debt financing markets,
political climate and general uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic and political conditions, both in the near term and the long term,
and both generally and within our industry, including the fact that valuation multiples in U.S. public equity markets are currently higher than
historical trends.
In the course of reaching its decision, our board of directors also considered a number of potentially negative factors including, among others, the
following:
•
Merger Consideration. Our board of directors considered the fact that the $11.00 per share in cash to be paid as Merger Consideration
represents a discount of approximately 9% to the 52-week high of MoneyGram’s stock of $12.04 reached on July 22, 2021.
•
Risks associated with announcement and pendency of the Merger. Our board of directors considered the risks associated with the
announcement and pendency of the Merger, including:
o
the risk that the restrictions on the conduct of MoneyGram’s business prior to the completion of the Merger imposed by the Merger
Agreement may adversely affect MoneyGram’s business in the event the Merger is not completed (including by delaying or
preventing MoneyGram from pursuing business opportunities that may arise or by precluding actions that would be advisable if
MoneyGram were to remain an independent company);
o
the risk that the public announcement of the Merger may cause substantial harm to our revenues, operating results and share price,
our relationships with our employees, agents, customers and partners and our ability to attract and retain key management and
personnel;
o
the risk that the Merger may divert management and employee attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business; and
50
Table of Contents
o
the risk that the time period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger will be significant due to the
expected time necessary to obtain required regulatory approvals, which enhances the above risks.
•
Risks associated with a failure to consummate the Merger. Our board of directors considered the fact that there can be no assurance that
all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied or will be satisfied prior to the end date (after giving
effect to any extension thereof already provided for in the merger agreement), and, as a result, the possibility that the merger might not be
completed.
•
Risks if the Merger is not consummated. Our board of directors considered the fact that, if the Merger is not completed:
o
we will have incurred significant risk and transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our operations,
diversion of management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our business and agent and
customer relationships; and, we may not be compensated completely or at all for such costs through the payment of a termination fee;
o
depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, it is likely that the price of our Common Stock will
decline significantly; and
o
the market’s perception of our prospects could be adversely affected.
•
Regulatory risk. Our board of directors considered certain regulatory risks, including:
o
the risk that necessary regulatory approvals may be delayed, conditioned or denied, including the fact that no termination fee would
be payable by Parent if certain regulatory approvals other than the required money transmitter approvals were not satisfied and
Parent was not then in breach of its obligations under the Merger Agreement;
o
the fact that the standards for obtaining the required money transmitter approvals are not strictly quantitative standards and are
instead subject to interpretation by the applicable regulatory bodies, which may not uniformly apply such standards, and that the
debt and equity financing necessary to fund the purchase price and the ultimate composition of Parent’s capital structure could affect
Parent’s ability to obtain the required money transmitter approvals; and
o
the fact that Parent’s obligations under the Merger Agreement to obtain regulatory approvals are limited in certain ways, as more
further described under “The Merger—Regulatory Matters.”
•
Financing risk. Our board of directors considered the risk that, while the Merger Agreement is not by its terms subject to a financing
condition, if Parent fails to obtain sufficient financing (notwithstanding the terms of the debt commitments and equity commitments), the
Merger may not be consummated and the termination fee of $65.5 million payable to us by Parent in such event may not be sufficient to
compensate us for potential losses we may incur under such circumstances.
•
Merger Agreement. Our board of directors considered certain terms of the Merger Agreement, including:
o
the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger, which could delay or prevent us from realizing
certain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to our operations we would otherwise take absent the pending
Merger;
o
provisions that preclude us from actively soliciting alternative proposals to the Merger outside of the go-shop period;
o
certain limitations on Parent’s undertakings in furtherance of obtaining required regulatory approvals, as more further described under
“The Merger—Regulatory Matters”;
51
Table of Contents
o
the requirement that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including by MoneyGram to accept a
superior proposal, MoneyGram would be obligated to pay a termination fee to Parent and the right of Parent to match any superior
proposal, each of which might have the effect of discouraging alternative acquisition proposals or reducing the price of such
proposals; and
o
provisions limiting Parent’s liability under certain conditions where the Merger does not close to the reverse termination fee of $30
million in connection with certain terminations arising from Parent’s failure to obtain the required money transmitter approvals or $65.5
million for other instances in which the reverse termination fee is payable.
•
Tax treatment. Our board of directors considered the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to MoneyGram’s stockholders that
are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
Participation in future gains. Our board of directors considered the fact that MoneyGram will no longer exist as an independent public
company and MoneyGram’s stockholders will forgo any future increase in MoneyGram’s value that might result from our earnings or
possible growth as an independent company.
•
Litigation risk. Our board of directors considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger.
•
Risk factors. Our board of directors considered other risks and uncertainties including those listed above in the section entitled
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
While our board of directors considered potentially positive and potentially negative factors, our board of directors concluded that, overall, the
potentially positive factors outweighed the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, our board of directors unanimously determined that the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of MoneyGram and its
stockholders.
The foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by our board of directors in its consideration
of the Merger, but is merely a summary of the material positive factors and material negative factors considered by our board of directors in that regard. In
view of the complexity, number and variety of factors and the amount of information considered, our board of directors did not find it practicable to make
specific assessments of, quantify, or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, in
considering the factors discussed above, individual members of our board of directors may have given different weights to different factors. Based on the
totality of the information presented, including discussions with, and questioning of, MoneyGram’s management and its financial and legal advisors, our
board of directors collectively reached the unanimous decision to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger in light of the factors
described above and other factors that the members of our board of directors felt were appropriate.
When you consider our board of directors’ recommendation, you should be aware that certain of MoneyGram’s directors may have interests in the
Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of MoneyGram’s stockholders generally. These interests are described in the section
entitled “The Merger—Interests of MoneyGram’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
This explanation of MoneyGram’s reasons for the Merger and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore,
should be read in light of the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

MoneyGram has retained BofA Securities to act as MoneyGram’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger. BofA Securities is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
MoneyGram selected BofA Securities to act as MoneyGram’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger on the basis of MoneyGram’s prior
retention of BofA Securities in various investment banking matters, BofA Securities’ experience in transactions similar to the Merger, its reputation in the
investment community and its familiarity with MoneyGram and its business.
On February 14, 2022, BofA Securities delivered to our board of directors a written opinion dated February 14, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of the
opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of
our Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion, dated February 14, 2022, to our board of directors, which sets forth, among other things, the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by BofA Securities in
rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of
BofA Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Securities delivered its opinion to our board of
directors for the benefit and use of our board of directors (in its capacity as our board of directors) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation
of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any terms or other aspects or implications of the
Merger and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be
available to MoneyGram or in which MoneyGram might engage or as to the underlying business decision of MoneyGram to proceed with or effect the
Merger. BofA Securities’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the proposed
Merger or any other matter.
In connection with its opinion, BofA Securities, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to MoneyGram;
•
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of MoneyGram
furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the management of MoneyGram, including certain financial forecasts relating to
MoneyGram prepared by the management of MoneyGram, which are described in the section entitled “Unaudited Financial Projections of
MoneyGram” and referred to in the proxy statement as the “MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections”;
•
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of MoneyGram with members of senior management
of MoneyGram;
•

BofA Securities deemed relevant;
•
compared certain financial and stock market information of MoneyGram with similar information of other companies BofA Securities deemed
relevant;
•
compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA Securities
deemed relevant;
•
reviewed a draft, dated February 14, 2022, of the Merger Agreement (which we refer to in this section of this proxy statement as the “Draft
Agreement”); and
53Table of Contents
•
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and
other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with BofA Securities, and BofA Securities relied upon
the assurances of the management of MoneyGram that it is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate
or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, BofA Securities was advised by MoneyGram, and
BofA Securities assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then-available estimates and good faith judgments of the
management of MoneyGram as to the future financial performance of MoneyGram. BofA Securities did not make and was not provided with any
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of MoneyGram, nor did it make any physical inspection of the
properties or assets of MoneyGram. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of MoneyGram or Parent under any state, federal or other
laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of MoneyGram, that the Merger would be
consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the
course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation,
restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on
MoneyGram or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of MoneyGram, that the final executed Merger
Agreement did not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Securities.
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other than the Merger Consideration to the
extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transaction or any other agreement,
arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. BofA Securities’ opinion was limited to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of our Common Stock and no opinion or view was expressed
with respect to any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of
any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to MoneyGram or in which MoneyGram might engage or as to the underlying business decision of MoneyGram to
proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities did not express any opinion with respect to, and relied, at the direction of MoneyGram, upon the
assessments of representatives of MoneyGram regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to MoneyGram or the Merger
(including the contemplated benefits thereof), as to which BofA Securities understood that MoneyGram had obtained such advice as MoneyGram
deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should
vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter.
BofA Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the
information made available to BofA Securities as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, and BofA Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities’ opinion was
approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities. Except as described above, MoneyGram imposed no other limitations on the
investigations made or procedures followed by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion.

The mean and median EV / calendar year 2022 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed for the selected personal financial services
publicly traded companies were 7.0x and 6.6x, respectively. The mean and median EV / calendar year 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened)
multiples observed for the selected personal financial services publicly traded companies were 6.6x and 6.5x, respectively.
The mean and median EV / calendar year 2022 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed for the selected processor and fintech
companies were 10.0x and 9.8x, respectively. The mean and median EV / calendar year 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed
for the selected processor and fintech companies were 8.6x and 8.9x, respectively.
The overall low to high calendar year 2022 and 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) multiples observed for all of the selected publicly traded
companies were 6.1x to 13.2x (with a mean of 8.7x and a median of 8.3x) and 5.3x to 10.5x (with a mean of 7.8x and a median of 7.7x), respectively. Estimated
financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on public filings and publicly available research analysts’ estimates.
Of the selected publicly traded companies, BofA Securities determined, based on its professional judgment and experience, that the market trading and
valuation characteristics of the personal financial services publicly traded companies and the processor and fintech publicly traded companies were more
similar to MoneyGram than the other selected publicly traded consumer finance companies and that the personal financial services publicly traded
companies were more similar to MoneyGram in terms of other characteristics than the processor and fintech publicly traded companies. Accordingly, for
purposes of its analysis, BofA Securities examined only the selected personal financial services companies and selected processors and fintech
companies (and not the other selected consumer finance companies), affording greater weight to the personal financial services publicly traded
companies, and also took into account the relative historical trading prices of the selected publicly traded companies relative to that of MoneyGram,
among others. BofA Securities thus applied calendar year 2022 and 2023 EBITDA multiples of 6.0x to 8.0x and 5.5x to 7.5x, respectively, derived from the
selected publicly traded companies, to MoneyGram’s calendar year 2022 and 2023 estimated Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) of $189 million and $231
million, respectively, as set forth in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, to calculate ranges of implied enterprise values for MoneyGram.
Estimated financial data of MoneyGram were based on the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections.

BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges per share of MoneyGram Common Stock by deducting estimated net debt of
MoneyGram of $710 million as of December 31, 2021, as provided by MoneyGram’s management, from such enterprise values and dividing the result by
the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, based on information provided by MoneyGram’s
management. In applying the calendar year 2022 and 2023 multiples, BofA Securities took into consideration, among other things, the observed data for
the selected publicly traded companies and for MoneyGram, the historical trading prices of MoneyGram’s Common Stock and the common stocks of the
selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial profiles of MoneyGram and the selected publicly traded companies.

information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction, and estimated financial data of MoneyGram were based on the MoneyGram

BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges per share of MoneyGram Common Stock by deducting estimated net debt of
MoneyGram of $710 million as of December 31, 2021, as provided by MoneyGram’s management, from such enterprise values and dividing the result by

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical to MoneyGram or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which
MoneyGram and the Merger were compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of MoneyGram to calculate the estimated present value of
the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that MoneyGram was forecasted to generate during MoneyGram’s fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year
2026 based on the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for MoneyGram by applying terminal
multiples ranging from 6.0x to 8.0x, based on the historical trading range for the MoneyGram stock as a multiple of the terminal year Adjusted EBITDA
(Burdened). The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.3% to
10.4%, which were based on an estimate of MoneyGram’s weighted average cost of capital. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per

opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
•
historical trading prices and trading volumes of our Common Stock, which indicated low and high closing prices for our Common Stock
during the 52-week period ended February 11, 2022 of approximately $5.20 to $12.04 per share; and
•
one-year future stock price targets for our Common Stock in publicly available research analyst reports, which indicated stock price targets

As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled “The Merger—MoneyGram Financial Analyses” represents a brief summary of the
material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to our board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description
of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex
analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA
Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its
analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative
description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact
that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other
analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of MoneyGram. The estimates of the future performance of MoneyGram in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested
by BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the Merger Consideration and were provided to our board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any securities have traded or
may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described
above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual value of MoneyGram.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between MoneyGram and Parent, rather than by any
financial advisor, and was approved by our board of directors. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of our board of directors.
As described above, BofA Securities’ opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by our board of directors in its evaluation of the
Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of our board of directors, management or any other party with respect to the Merger or
the Merger Consideration.
MoneyGram has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee that is currently estimated to be $20.2
million, approximately $1 million of which was payable upon the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent
upon the consummation of the Merger. MoneyGram also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA
Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. Pursuant to its engagement letter with
MoneyGram, BofA Securities would be entitled to a transaction fee from MoneyGram in connection with any merger or similar acquisition transaction,
irrespective of the identity of the acquirer. Such fee would generally be higher for a transaction that provides for greater merger consideration.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives trading,
foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and
investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,
governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of
customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold

long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of MoneyGram, Parent and certain of their respective affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial
banking and other financial services to MoneyGram and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services,
including (i) having acted or acting as administrative agent, bookrunner, co-lead arranger for, and as a lender (including a swing line lender and a letter of
credit lender) under, certain credit facilities and/or agreements of MoneyGram, (ii) having acted or acting as sole sales agent on a registered at-the-market
offering for MoneyGram and as a bookrunner on a bond offering for MoneyGram and (iii) having provided or providing certain foreign exchange, treasury
and trade management services and products to MoneyGram. From January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived
aggregate revenues from MoneyGram of approximately $34 million.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment banking,
commercial banking and other financial services to MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies and have received or in the future may
receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to MDP and certain of its affiliates and
portfolio companies in connection with certain mergers and acquisition transactions, (ii) having acted or acting as administrative agent, collateral agent,
arranger, bookrunner and/or lender for MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies in connection with, among other purposes, the financing
for various acquisition transactions, (iii) having acted or acting as underwriter, initial purchaser and placement agent for various equity and debt offerings
undertaken by MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies and (iv) having provided or providing certain treasury and trade services and
products to MDP and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies. BofA Securities has advised us that from January 1, 2020 through December 31,
2021, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from MDP and certain of their respective affiliates of over $80 million for investment
and corporate banking services.",67,68
MONEYGRAM INTERNATIONAL INC_20220421_DEFM14A_20027475_4446252.Pdf,Unaudited Financial Projections of MoneyGram,"Unaudited Financial Projections of MoneyGram
Except for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection with its ordinary course earnings announcements,
MoneyGram does not usually make public detailed projections as to earnings or other results, due to, among other reasons, the unpredictability of the
underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections. However, the senior management of MoneyGram regularly prepares, for
internal purposes, prospective financial information in connection with its ordinary course strategic planning and, in connection with the evaluation of a
possible transaction, prospective financial information regarding MoneyGram’s future performance on a standalone basis for the years 2021 through 2026
(the “MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections”) was provided to our board of directors and BofA Securities, as the financial advisor to MoneyGram,
to assist in evaluating MoneyGram’s operations and prospects and the Merger. In addition, the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections were
provided to MDP in connection with its evaluation of MoneyGram and its analysis of the Merger, as well as to certain other parties potentially interested
in a transaction with MoneyGram. The MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections were prepared as of January 24, 2022 and have not been
subsequently updated.
The MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), the guidelines of the SEC with respect to prospective financial information or the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. In the view of
MoneyGram’s management, this information was, based on certain growth assumptions, prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best available
estimates and judgments at the time of its preparation, and presented, to the best of MoneyGram’s management’s knowledge and belief, the expected
course of action and the expected future financial performance of MoneyGram on a standalone basis at the time of its preparation.
60Table of Contents
However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future results, and you are cautioned not to rely on the
MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections. The MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections do not reflect any impact of the Merger and do not take
into account the potential consequences should the Merger fail to be consummated, and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in those
contexts.
Neither MoneyGram’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect
to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its
achievability, and assume no responsibility for the prospective financial information. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relates to the historical financial information of MoneyGram. The report does not extend to the
unaudited financial projections and should not be read to do so.
In developing the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, MoneyGram’s management made numerous material assumptions with respect to
MoneyGram for the periods covered by the projections, including, but not limited to, the following:
•
the revenues, operating expenses and margins from existing business activities;
•
assumptions with respect to organic growth projects and other capital investments, such as the amounts and timing of capital expenditures
and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), if any, associated with such projects;
•
the availability and cost of debt and equity;
•
assumptions relating to the demand for our services;
•
assumptions relating to the taxes we will incur in the various jurisdictions in which we operate; and
•
other general business, market, regulatory and financial assumptions.
All of these assumptions involve variables making them difficult to predict, and most are beyond the control of MoneyGram. Although MoneyGram’s
management believes that there was a reasonable basis for the underlying assumptions related to the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, there
can be no assurance that such underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized, and the risk of inaccuracy
increases with the length of the forecasted period.
The MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections are summarized in the table below.

“Adjusted EBITDA” for purposes of this table means earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, plus special charges and
other one-time items, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles. Amortization costs of signing bonus payments for MoneyGram,
which were used by BofA Securities in calculating Adjusted EBITDA (Burdened) as described above in “The Merger—Opinion of MoneyGram’s
Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration,” were projected by management of MoneyGram to be $57.3 million, $54.5 million, $36.3
million, $33.7 million, $31.4 million and $25.7 million for the years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-
GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income as a measure of operating performance
or cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of any potential synergies or costs related to the Merger.

The estimates and assumptions underlying the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections are inherently uncertain and, though considered reasonable
by the management of MoneyGram as of the date of the preparation of such projections, are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic,
regulatory and competitive risks and uncertainties that are outside of the control of MoneyGram and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, including, among other things, the matters described in the section entitled
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projections are indicative of the future
performance of MoneyGram, or that actual results will not differ materially from the results presented in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections.
Inclusion of the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as a representation by any person that the
results contained in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections will be achieved. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in
the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections, MoneyGram stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the MoneyGram
Unaudited Financial Projections.
Adjusted EBITDA contained in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections summarized above is a “non-GAAP financial measure,” which is a
financial performance measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the MoneyGram Unaudited
Financial Projections were relied upon by BofA Securities with the approval of MoneyGram’s management for purposes of its opinion and by our board
of directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial
measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business
combination, such as the Merger, if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP
financial measures were not relied upon by BofA Securities for purposes of its opinion or by our board of directors in connection with its evaluation of
the Merger. Accordingly, MoneyGram has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial
Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for,
financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by MoneyGram may not be comparable to similarly
titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and
credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with,
and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The inclusion of the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that such projections
are material information of MoneyGram or predictive of actual future results nor should it be construed as financial guidance, and it should not be relied
upon as such. The MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections are not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any MoneyGram stockholder
to vote in favor of any of the proposals at the special meeting, but have been included solely because the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections
were made available by management of MoneyGram to our board of directors, BofA Securities and MDP, and the MoneyGram Unaudited Financial
Projections were used by BofA Securities in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion to our board of directors and performing its related
financial analyses, as described in the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of MoneyGram’s Financial Advisor Regarding the Merger Consideration.”
MoneyGram has made no representation to MDP, Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the
MoneyGram Unaudited Financial Projections.
WE DO NOT INTEND TO REVISE THE MONEYGRAM UNAUDITED FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER

In considering the recommendation of MoneyGram’s board of directors that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,
“FOR” the advisory, non-binding proposal relating to compensation that will be or may become payable to MoneyGram’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if necessary and appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting, you should be aware that MoneyGram’s directors
and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of MoneyGram’s stockholders generally.
MoneyGram’s board of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement
and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and in recommending the applicable Merger-related proposals.
The following discussion sets forth certain of these interests in the Merger of each person who has served as an executive officer or non-employee
director of MoneyGram since January 1, 2021 (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Victor Dahir, who ceased to serve as a non-employee director
upon his death on March 20, 2021).",71,71

The executive officers and directors of MoneyGram who hold Common Stock at the closing of the Merger will be eligible to receive the same Merger
Consideration as the other MoneyGram stockholders with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock held. The executive officers and directors
of MoneyGram held, in the aggregate, 3,241,298 shares of Common Stock (or approximately 3.4% of all outstanding Common Stock) as of April 15, 2022,
excluding shares issuable upon exercise of MoneyGram Option Awards or subject to outstanding equity awards, which are discussed below.
The table below sets forth the number of shares of our Common Stock held by the executive officers and directors of MoneyGram as of April 15, 2022
(excluding stock options and restricted stock units), and the value (based on $11.00 per share, which is equal to the Merger Consideration) they would

If the closing date happens in 2023 or a subsequent year, MoneyGram may grant MoneyGram 2023 RSUs under the Company Stock Plan prior to the
actual closing date, the terms of which are unknown at this time. Any MoneyGram 2023 RSU, will, unless otherwise agreed to in writing, be converted into
a cash-settled long-term incentive award (a “converted award”) representing a right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product
of (i) the Merger Consideration ($11.00 per share) and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock underlying such MoneyGram 2023 RSU (and, with
respect to any such award that is subject to performance-based vesting, such number of shares of Common Stock will be based on achievement of the
performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement at the greater of the target level and the actual level of performance achieved immediately
prior to the effective time), on the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to such MoneyGram 2023 RSU immediately before the effective time. On
the date, and to the extent, that the converted awards become vested, such vested converted awards shall be paid, subject to any applicable withholding
taxes, as soon as practicable thereafter (but in any event, not later than the second regular payroll date thereafter). Each performance-based cash award
granted on or after January 1, 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, representing the right to receive cash payments,
whether subject to performance-based vesting requirements or time-based vesting requirements, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time, shall continue in accordance with its terms.

In connection with the 2022 annual long-term incentive award grants, MoneyGram’s board of directors approved retention bonuses for certain of those
individuals who have served as an executive officer of MoneyGram at any time since January 1, 2021. These bonuses (each, a “Retention Bonus”) are
time-based cash grants which will vest at the earlier of (i) the closing date or (ii) the first anniversary of the date of grant. Such Retention Bonuses will be
forfeited, in full, if the recipient’s employment terminates for any reason prior to vesting.
The value of each Retention Bonus is equal to 12.5% of the 2022 target annual long-term incentive award value for each such executive officer.
Concurrent with these awards, the board of directors also approved a 12.5% increase to the total annual long-term incentive award value received by each
other participant in MoneyGram’s 2022 long-term incentive award program.

outstanding vested MoneyGram Option Award immediately following termination will remain exercisable until the earliest of (i) the expiration of the ten-
year term of such option, or (ii) the six month anniversary of the date of termination. Regardless of a change in control, Mr. Holmes will be entitled to the
following upon a termination by MoneyGram without Cause or by Mr. Holmes for Good Reason: (i) payment of his accrued and unpaid base salary (as
defined in the employment agreement) and unpaid reimbursement of expenses; (ii) a pro-rata portion of his bonus under the MoneyGram Performance
Bonus Plan (the “Performance Bonus Plan”) for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, if cash bonuses pursuant to the Performance Bonus Plan
are paid to other participants in the plan; (iii) payment in equal installments, in accordance with normal payroll practices, over the two year period
following his termination of employment, of an aggregate amount equal to two times the sum of (a) his base salary, and (b) his target annual bonus; (iv)

becomes eligible to receive comparable health and life insurance coverage from a subsequent employer; and (v) all other accrued or vested amounts or

agreement (except for a failure that is attributable to the executive’s illness, injury or disability) for a period of ten days following written
notice MoneyGram to the executive of such failure; (ii) fraud or material dishonesty in the performance of the executive’s duties under the
employment agreement; (iii) an act or acts on the executive’s part constituting (a) a felony under the laws of the United States or any state

employment agreement; provided that, no act or failure to act on the executive’s part shall be considered “willful” unless done, or omitted to
be done, by the executive in bad faith and without reasonable belief that the executive’s action or omission was in the best interest of
MoneyGram.
68Table of Contents
•
“Good Reason” generally means without the executive’s consent, (i) any material reduction in the executive’s position or responsibilities,
excluding an isolated, insubstantial or inadvertent action not taken in bad faith; (ii) a material reduction of the executive’s base salary, or
target bonus opportunity then in effect, except in connection with an across-the-board reduction of not more than 10% applicable to senior
executives of MoneyGram; or (iii) the reassignment of the executive’s place of work to a location more than 50 miles from the executive’s
place of work; provided that none of the events described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) shall constitute Good Reason unless (a) the executive
shall have given written notice to MoneyGram of the executive’s intent to terminate his employment with Good Reason within 60 days
following the occurrence of any such event and (b) MoneyGram shall have failed to remedy such event within 30 days of MoneyGram’s

The individual severance agreements entered into by the other executive officers provide for the following severance treatment with regard to a change in
control. If within 24 months following a change in control and a termination of employment by MoneyGram without Cause (as defined in the severance
agreement and described below) or by the executive for Good Reason (as defined in the severance agreement and described below), the executive will be
entitled to: (i) a cash payment equal to the executive’s then current monthly base salary multiplied by twelve and payable in equal monthly installments
over the twelve months following termination; (ii) a pro-rata portion of the executive’s bonus (up to target level) payable in a lump sum at the time other
bonuses are paid, if cash bonuses pursuant to the Performance Bonus Plan are paid to participants; and (iii) immediate full vesting of each restricted
stock unit award and long-term performance-based cash award (and any replacement, continuation or converted award) held by the executive on the date
of termination (at 100% of the target level, in the case of any award then subject to performance-based vesting criteria if the termination occurs on or prior
to the last day of the performance period).
For purposes of each severance agreement between MoneyGram and its executive officers, the following terms generally have the definitions set forth
below:
•
“Cause” generally means (i) the executive’s willful refusal to carry out, in all respects, the reasonable and lawful directions of the person or
persons to whom the executive reports or MoneyGram’s board of directors that are within the executive’s control and consistent with the

of such a failure; (ii) fraud or material dishonesty in performance with the executive’s duties under the severance agreement; (iii) an act or

as determined in good faith by MoneyGram’s board of directors; (vi) the executive’s material breach of MoneyGram’s Code of Ethics,
Always Honest policy or any other code of conduct in effect from time to time to the extent applicable to the executive, and which breach
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on MoneyGram as determined in good faith by MoneyGram’s board of
directors; or (vii) the executive’s breach of the Employee Trade Secret, Confidential Information and Post-Employment Restriction
Agreement which breach has an adverse effect of MoneyGram.
•
“Good Reason” generally means (i) a material reduction in the executive’s position or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated,
insubstantial or inadvertent action not taken in bad faith; (ii) a material reduction in the executive’s base salary or target bonus opportunity,

services to MDP or the surviving company following the effective time of the Merger may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and
may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by MDP. As of the date hereof, no compensation arrangements between

into with each of the other named executive officers, in the amount of $4,389,347 for Mr. Holmes, $584,326 for Mr. Angelilli, $572,024 for Mr. Lines,
$535,120 for Mr. Villareal and $572,024 for Mr. Villaseñor. These cash severance payments under Mr. Holmes’ employment agreement consist of (i) a
cash payment two times the sum of (x) his base salary and (y) his target annual bonus, and (ii) a pro-rata portion of his bonus under the
Performance Bonus Plan (if such bonuses are paid to other participants), and these cash severance payments under the severance agreements
entered into with each of the other named executive officers consists of (a) a cash payment equal to the executive’s monthly base salary multiplied
by twelve, and (b) a pro-rata portion of the executive’s bonus (up to target level). The cash severance payments pursuant to Mr. Holmes’s
employment agreement are payable upon his termination of employment without Cause or resignation for Good Reason, in each case, whether or
not a change in control occurs, and the cash severance payments pursuant to the named executive officers’ severance agreements are considered
to be “double-trigger” payments, which means that both a change in control, such as the Merger, and another event (i.e., a named executive
officer’s termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason) must occur prior to such payments being provided to the named executive
officer. In addition, amounts shown also reflect the single-trigger accelerated vesting and payout of the MoneyGram Pre-2023 Performance Cash
Awards held by the named executive officers in the following amounts: $2,763,021 for Mr. Holmes, $795,000 for Mr. Angelilli, $795,000 for Mr. Lines,
$770,000 for Mr. Villareal and $820,000 for Mr. Villaseñor.

Amounts shown reflect the sum of the potential value that each named executive officer could receive in connection with the single-trigger
accelerated vesting and cash settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units, whether subject to time-based or performance-based vesting
(calculated at target if performance has yet to be certified). No value has been included for the MoneyGram Option Awards held by Messrs. Holmes
and Angelilli because the exercise price applicable to the MoneyGram Option Awards is greater than the Merger Consideration payable with
respect to such awards. These payments are considered to be “single-trigger” payments, which means that only a change in control, such as the
Merger, must occur prior to such payments being provided to the named executive officers.
(3)
Amounts shown reflect the value of the continuation of health and life insurance coverage for Mr. Holmes, for the maximum period of two years
under his employment agreement. This benefit is considered to be a “double-trigger” benefit, which means that both a change in control, such as
the Merger, and another event (i.e., Mr. Holmes’s termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason) must occur prior to such payments
being provided to Mr. Holmes.
(4)
Amounts shown reflect value of Retention Bonuses granted to each named executive officer. These payments are considered to be “single-trigger”
payments, which means that only a change in control, such as the Merger, must occur prior to such payments being provided to the named
executive officers.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, our board of directors will be replaced by the board of directors of Merger Sub, or such other individuals
that Parent may designate prior to the effective time of the Merger to serve as directors of the surviving corporation, and will not hold any directorships
with Merger Sub or Parent unless designated by Parent.
Following the Merger, the board of directors designated by Merger Sub will have the authority to retain or replace the existing executive officers of
MoneyGram. It is expected that MoneyGram will continue to be led by Mr. Holmes, as Chief Executive Officer, and MoneyGram’s existing management
team.
Indemnification and Insurance
The Merger Agreement provides that after the effective time of the Merger, Parent will cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of MoneyGram in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement and permitted by
applicable law, all past and present directors and officers of MoneyGram or any of its subsidiaries, referred to collectively as, the “Indemnified Parties,”
with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the Merger. In addition, for six years after the effective time of the Merger,
Parent will not permit any amendments to the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of MoneyGram or its subsidiaries that
would adversely affect any right of a person who was or is a director or officer of MoneyGram or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the Merger
with respect elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses under MoneyGram’s
and its subsidiaries’ certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement.
For a period of six years after the effective time of the Merger, Parent is also required to maintain or cause the surviving company to maintain directors’
and officers’ liability insurance policy (from MoneyGram’s current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating, as of the
closing date of the Merger, as MoneyGram’s current insurance carrier) that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of
the Merger with terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the terms and conditions of the
existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy of the MoneyGram. However, at Parent’s option, in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage,
Parent or, with Parent’s consent, MoneyGram may at or prior to the effective time of the Merger substitute the insurance coverage for a single premium
tail coverage with respect to such insurance that provides coverage for a period of six years after the effective time of the Merger, with terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to such Indemnified Parties than the terms and conditions of the existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy of MoneyGram. However, Parent will not be required to expend, in the aggregate, an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by MoneyGram for the existing directors’ and
72Table of Contents

MoneyGram holds money transmitter licenses in numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The relevant laws and regulations of certain of these
jurisdictions require that, prior to the acquisition of control of a licensee, the licensee and/or acquirer must notify the applicable regulatory authority,
make certain filings with such regulatory authority, and/or obtain the approval of such regulatory authority. It is a condition to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s

Under the Merger Agreement, each of the parties agreed to use reasonable best efforts to complete the Merger and to prepare all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests and other documents to obtain approval from any governmental entity that is required to be obtained in
connection with the Merger, including approval from U.S. antitrust authorities and financing approvals with respect to money transmitter licenses. The
parties have also agreed to use reasonable best efforts to comply with all legal requirements with respect to obtaining approvals for the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, defend all lawsuits or other proceedings challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger,
seek to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of, litigation seeking the entry of, or seek to have lifted or rescinded, any injunction or restraining
order which may adversely affect the ability of the parties to complete the Merger, and to resolve any objection by a governmental entity challenging the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates are required to agree to or take any
action that would result in a “burdensome condition” as defined in the Merger Agreement and as further described in the section entitled “The Merger

While we expect that all regulatory approvals will be obtained without the imposition of a burdensome condition, there is no certainty that these
approvals will be obtained or obtained within the period of time contemplated by the Merger Agreement, that any such approvals would not involve the
imposition of burdensome conditions or that other regulatory challenges to the Merger will not be made. If a challenge is made, we cannot predict the
result. Any conditions with respect to such regulatory approvals could result in the conditions to the completion of the Merger not being satisfied.

Appraisal Rights",82,82
MONEYGRAM INTERNATIONAL INC_20220421_DEFM14A_20027475_4446252.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
Under Delaware law, holders of record of shares of our Common Stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger, provided that such
holders meet all of the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If the Merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our Common Stock who
continuously hold shares through the effective time of the Merger, who did not vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement and who otherwise comply with the applicable statutory procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in
connection with the Merger.
Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, if you do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement, you have the right to
seek appraisal of your shares of our Common Stock and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of our Common Stock, exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value. The “fair value” of your shares of our Common Stock as determined
by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may be less than, equal to or more than the $11.00 per share that you would otherwise be entitled to
receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal for their
74Table of Contents
shares in compliance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to such appraisal rights. Strict compliance with the statutory
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements may result in the loss or waiver
of your appraisal rights.
This section is intended only as a brief summary of certain provisions of the statutory procedures that a stockholder must follow under the DGCL in order
to seek and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and the law pertaining to appraisal
rights under the DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which appears in Annex C to this proxy
statement. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days before the special meeting at which the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement is
considered, MoneyGram is required to notify each of the holders of our Common Stock as of the record date who are entitled to appraisal rights that such
rights are available for any or all of such holder’s shares of our Common Stock, and is required to include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes a formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the Merger.
ANY HOLDER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE THEIR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE
THEIR RIGHT TO DO SO, SHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANNEX C CAREFULLY BECAUSE FAILURE TO TIMELY AND
PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OR WAIVER OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER THE DGCL.
MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL OF SHARES OF OUR
COMMON STOCK, MONEYGRAM BELIEVES THAT A STOCKHOLDER CONSIDERING THE EXERCISE OF SUCH RIGHTS SHOULD SEEK THE
ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek appraisal of their shares of our Common Stock must fully comply with Section 262 of the DCGL, which
means, among other things, all of the following:
•
the stockholder must deliver to MoneyGram a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement is taken at the special meeting;
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the Merger (a
stockholder may lose or waive appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares prior to the effective time of the Merger); and
•
the stockholder or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware demanding a
determination of value of the shares within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation
to file any petition and has no present intention of doing so.
Because a properly executed proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must
vote against the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, hers or its shares.",82,83
MONEYGRAM INTERNATIONAL INC_20220421_DEFM14A_20027475_4446252.Pdf,Written Demand by the Record Holder,"Written Demand by the Record Holder
MoneyGram’s stockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights must deliver to MoneyGram a written demand for appraisal of their shares before the
vote with respect to the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement is taken at the special meeting, and such stockholders must not vote or submit a
proxy in favor of the
75Table of Contents
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement either at the special meeting or by proxy. A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must
continue to hold the shares of record on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the
effective time of the Merger. The stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. A proxy that is
submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,
and it may cause a stockholder to lose or waive the stockholder’s right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.
Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. The written
demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Under
Section 262 of the DGCL, neither a proxy or vote against the Merger, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement, will in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the
taking of the vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting may cause the stockholder to lose or waive his, her
or its appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.
The written demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the record holder of shares, fully and correctly, as such holder’s name appears on the stock
records of MoneyGram. Written demands must reasonably inform MoneyGram of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to
demand appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of our Common Stock. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it
appears on the share certificate or certificates that represent such stockholder’s shares or in the book entry that represents such stockholder’s shares, as
the case may be. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand must be
made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand
must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including one of two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a
stockholder of record. However, the agent must identify the record owner(s) and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is
acting as agent for the record owner(s).
A beneficial owner of shares of our Common Stock held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions as may be
necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of the shares. If the shares are held through a brokerage
firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee, a demand for appraisal of such shares must be
made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as the record stockholder. Any beneficial owner who wishes
to exercise appraisal rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the
record stockholder. The beneficial holder of the shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the record
holder of the shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.
All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to MoneyGram’s corporate secretary at:

Within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation or any MoneyGram stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of
the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, with a copy served on MoneyGram in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of our
Common Stock held by all such stockholders entitled to appraisal. If no such petition is filed by any stockholders entitled to appraisal within that 120-day
period, appraisal rights may be lost or waived for all dissenting stockholders. MoneyGram is under no obligation to, and has no present intention to, file a
petition in the event there are dissenting stockholders, and stockholders should not assume that MoneyGram will file a petition or that it will initiate any
negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of our Common Stock. Accordingly, it is the obligation of MoneyGram’s stockholders to initiate all
necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares of our Common Stock within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, any MoneyGram stockholder who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal
rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted
in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of such dissenting stockholders. Such statement must be mailed by the surviving corporation within 10 days after the receipt of a
written request from the dissenting stockholders or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is
later. Notwithstanding the requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of shares, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been properly made and
not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the statement described
in this paragraph.
Upon the filing of such petition by any such holder of shares, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be
obligated within 20 days after such service to file in the office of the Register in Chancery of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (referred to as
the “Delaware Register in Chancery”) a duly verified list (referred to as the “verified list”) containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who
have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving corporation.
Upon the filing of any such petition, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may order the Delaware Register in Chancery to provide notice of the
time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the
verified list. Such notice will also be published in one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The
forms of notice by mail or publication will be approved by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the costs of these notices are borne by the
surviving corporation.
After notice to the stockholders as required by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing
on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights
thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of our Common Stock and who hold shares
represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal
proceeding, and, if any such stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder.
Even if a stockholder
77Table of Contents
complies with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, because immediately before the Merger the shares of Common Stock will be listed on a
national securities exchange, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
unless (i) the total number of shares of our Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock eligible for
appraisal or (ii) the value of the Merger Consideration for such total number of shares of our Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value",85,86
MONEYGRAM INTERNATIONAL INC_20220421_DEFM14A_20027475_4446252.Pdf,Determination of Fair Value,"Determination of Fair Value
After the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted
in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal
proceeding, the Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (or in certain circumstances described
below, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the Merger to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded
quarterly and will accrue at 5.0% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between effective time of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Despite the foregoing, at any time before the entry of a judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter
as provided in the immediately preceding sentence only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the
shares of our Common Stock as determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. The surviving
corporation is under no obligation to make such a voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of
value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.”
The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of Chancery must consider market value, asset value, the
price negotiated by the parties, the unaffected stock price, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair
value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger [.]” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies
only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated
that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the
product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual
circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder’s exclusive remedy.
Stockholders considering appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of our Common Stock as so determined could be more than, the
same as or less than the per share Merger Consideration such stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger if such
stockholders did not seek appraisal and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
78Table of Contents
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, “fair value” under Section 262 of
the DGCL. Although MoneyGram believes that the per share Merger Consideration is fair, we cannot make any assurances as to the outcome of the
appraisal of fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. MoneyGram does not anticipate offering more than the per share
Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and MoneyGram reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for
purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of a share of our Common Stock is less than the per share Merger Consideration.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of our Common Stock entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders
entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of shares of our Common Stock whose name appears on the verified list and, if such shares are represented by
certificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery, may participate fully in all
proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair
value of the shares of our Common Stock, together with interest, if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value (or, in certain circumstances
described in this proxy statement, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation
in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) by the surviving corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock, forthwith, and, in the case
of holders of shares represented by certificates, upon the surrender to the surviving corporation of such stockholder’s certificates. The Court of
Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such Court may be enforced.
The costs of the action (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may
order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged, pro rata, against the value of all the shares of our
Common Stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.
Any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal rights for shares of our Common Stock in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the
effective time of the Merger, be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions thereon,
except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of shares of our Common Stock as of a date or time prior to the effective time of the
Merger.
At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger; after
this period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal only with the consent of MoneyGram. No appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware deems just. If no petition for
appraisal is filed with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, stockholders’ rights to
appraisal shall cease and all holders of shares of our Common Stock will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Inasmuch as MoneyGram has no
obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention to do so, any holder of shares of our Common Stock who desires such a petition to be filed
is advised to file it on a timely basis. Any stockholder may withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal by delivering to MoneyGram a written
withdrawal of its demand for appraisal and acceptance of the Merger Consideration, except that (a) any such attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days
after the effective time of

the Merger will require written approval of MoneyGram and (b) no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be
dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and such approval may be conditioned upon
such terms as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware deems just. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and accept the terms offered
upon the Merger within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger.
If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares of our Common Stock in favor of the Merger and you must comply with the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to take any required step in connection with the exercise of appraisal rights, it may result in the
termination or waiver of your appraisal rights.
The foregoing is a brief summary of the rights of MoneyGram stockholders to seek appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and does not purport
to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by MoneyGram stockholders desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available to them and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and
Section 262, Section 262 will govern. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss or waiver of a stockholder’s statutory
appraisal rights. In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, MoneyGram’s stockholders who may wish to pursue appraisal rights should
consult their legal and financial advisors.

The total amount of funds necessary to consummate the Merger and the related transactions will be funded by a combination of equity and debt
financing. The Parent and Merger Sub will obtain such funding through the proceeds from one or more debt financing transactions and an equity
financing. The Guarantors have committed to provide equity financing to Parent pursuant to an equity commitment letter (of which MoneyGram is a third-
party beneficiary), in the aggregate amount set forth therein, subject to the terms of such equity commitment letter. The Lenders have committed to
provide debt financing to Merger Sub pursuant to a debt financing commitment letter in the aggregate amount set forth therein, subject to the terms of
such debt commitment letter. The aggregate funds committed to be made available to Parent and Merger Sub under the equity commitment letter and the
debt commitment letter, respectively, will provide in the aggregate sufficient funds to consummate the Merger and the related transactions, including the
aggregate funds needed to (i) pay our stockholders the aggregate Merger Consideration due to them under the Merger Agreement; (ii) make payments
pursuant to the Merger Agreement in respect of outstanding MoneyGram LTI Awards granted under the Company Stock Plan; (iii) repay the outstanding
indebtedness and other obligations of MoneyGram under its existing credit agreement and redeem its existing notes at the required redemption price; and
(iv) pay fees, premiums and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement and in connection with the debt financing and the
repayment of MoneyGram’s existing indebtedness. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement are not conditioned upon
obtaining the financing described above.

In connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub entered into a commitment letter with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Deutsche Bank
AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Barclays Bank PLC, Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the “debt commitment parties”) providing for a senior secured term loan

facility in an aggregate amount up to $700,000,000 and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount up to $150,000,000 (the “debt

In the event Merger Sub is unable to complete a private placement of a junior financing in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000 prior to closing
of the Merger, the debt commitment parties have agreed to provide additional debt financing in the form of an unsecured senior bridge facility in an
aggregate principal amount up to $500,000,000 under certain circumstances.
The commitments of the debt commitment parties under the debt commitment letter are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by the applicable debt
commitment party) of certain conditions precedent, including, without limitation:
•
the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the debt commitment letter) since January 24, 2022;
•
the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any amendment or waiver that would
be materially adverse to the interests of the lenders in their capacity as such without the consent of the debt commitment parties);
•
subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the accuracy in all material respects as of the date of closing of the Merger of certain specified
representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and certain specified representations and warranties in the debt commitment letter;
•
the equity financing contemplated by the equity commitment letter (as defined below) shall have occurred or, substantially concurrently
with the initial funding contemplated by the debt commitment letter, shall occur;
•
the refinancing of certain of MoneyGram’s existing indebtedness shall have occurred or, substantially concurrently with the initial funding
contemplated by the debt commitment letter, shall occur; and
•
other customary conditions precedent set forth in the debt commitment letter.
The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter will terminate at the earliest to occur of (i)
the consummation of the Merger without the funding of the debt financing, (ii) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, February 22, 2023 subject to automatic
extension in the event that the end date under the Merger Agreement is extended by the parties to the Merger Agreement in connection with obtaining
certain required money transfer approvals, as more particularly described in the Merger Agreement, (iii) the funding of the credit facilities and (iv) the

In connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, the Guarantors entered into a commitment letter (the “equity commitment letter”), whereby the
Guarantors committed to provide equity financing of $810,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the equity commitment letter. The
proceeds from the equity financing will be used to finance a portion of the Merger Consideration and LTI Award consideration. Each Guarantor may
assign all or a portion of its equity commitment to any other investor or co-investor, although no assignment of the equity commitment will relieve a
Guarantor of its obligations under the equity commitment letter except to the extent such other investor actually funds the amount required under the
equity commitment letter to Parent.
The commitments of the Guarantors under the equity commitment letter are subject to (i) the satisfaction or waiver by Parent of each of the conditions to
Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger,
81Table of Contents
as set forth in the Merger Agreement, (ii) the substantially concurrent consummation and funding of the debt financing on the terms set forth in the debt

are funded, the Merger will be consummated.
The obligation of the Guarantors to fund the commitments under the equity commitment letter shall, in each case, automatically and immediately terminate
upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the closing of the Merger, provided that the Guarantors shall at or prior thereto have fully funded and paid their
respective commitments under the equity commitment to Parent, directly or indirectly; (b) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance

The following is a summary of certain material United States federal income tax considerations applicable to our stockholders of the receipt of cash in
exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. This summary is based upon the provisions of the Code, applicable United States
Treasury Regulations, judicial authority and administrative rulings and practice, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement. All of these authorities
are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis and to differing interpretations, all of which could result in tax considerations different from those
described below. This discussion assumes that the shares of our Common Stock are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
by their beneficial owners. This discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular
stockholder in light of such stockholder’s unique investment circumstances, or to stockholders subject to special treatment under the United States
federal income tax laws (for example (but not limited to), banks, insurance companies, or other financial institutions; dealers or brokers in securities or
currencies; traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment; tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other
governmental organizations and pension funds; retirement plans or other tax-deferred accounts; S-corporations, partnerships, or other pass-through
entities; mutual funds; real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies; personal holding companies; United States expatriates, including
expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code; controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies; corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; “U.S. holders” (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; stockholders
who hold shares of our Common Stock as part of a hedging, “straddle,” constructive sale, conversion or other risk-reduction strategy or integrated
transaction; holders that own, or have owned, actually, indirectly or constructively, more than 5% of our Common Stock; grantor trusts; or stockholders
who acquired their shares of our Common Stock through the
82Table of Contents
exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements or stockholders who receive cash pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights). In
addition, this discussion is general in nature and does not address any aspect of state, local, alternative minimum, estate, gift or non-United States
taxation that may be applicable to a particular stockholder.
MoneyGram stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the receipt of cash in exchange
for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (including the application and effect of any state, local or non-United States income and other
tax laws).
If a partnership (or an entity or arrangement taxable as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our Common Stock,
the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership
holding our Common Stock, you should consult your own tax advisor as to the particular tax consequences to you of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of our Common Stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any
of the following:
•
a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the
laws of the United States, any state in the United States, or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or
•
an estate that is subject to United States federal income tax on all of its income regardless of source.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or other entity or arrangement taxable as a partnership for United States federal
income tax purposes) of our Common Stock that is not a U.S. holder.

MONEYGRAM INTERNATIONAL INC_20220421_DEFM14A_20027475_4446252.Pdf,U.S. Holders,"U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash in the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for United States federal income tax purposes. Generally, a U.S.
holder of shares of our Common Stock will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received in the Merger and such
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of our Common Stock converted into cash pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss will be determined
separately for each block of shares (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) owned by a U.S. holder. If the shares of our Common
Stock have been held for more than one year at the effective time of the Merger, the gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss, and will be
short-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for one year or less. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. holders may be
subject to reduced tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation.
A 3.8% tax is imposed on the “net investment income” of certain U.S. holders that are individuals, trusts or estates if their income exceeds certain
thresholds. In the case of an individual, the net investment income tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i) an individual’s “net investment income” or (ii)
the amount by which an individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000 (if the individual is married and filing jointly or a surviving
spouse), $125,000 (if the individual is married and filing separately) or $200,000 (in any other case). In the case of an estate or trust, the tax will be imposed
on the lesser of (i) undistributed “net investment income” or
83Table of Contents
(ii) the excess of adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins. For these
purposes, “net investment income” generally will include any gain recognized on the receipt of the cash for shares of our Common Stock in the Merger.
Information returns will be filed with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) in connection with payments to a U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger, unless
the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient. Under the United States federal income tax backup withholding rules, the paying agent generally will be required to
withhold 24% of all payments to which a U.S. holder is entitled in the Merger, unless the U.S. holder (1) is a corporation or comes within other exempt
categories and demonstrates this fact or (2) provides its correct tax identification number (social security number, in the case of an individual, or employer
identification number in the case of other stockholders), certifies under penalties of perjury that the number is correct, certifies as to no loss of exemption
from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Each U.S. holder should complete,
sign and return to the paying agent for the Merger the IRS Form W-9 that each stockholder will receive with the letter of transmittal following completion
of the Merger in order to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, unless an applicable exception exists and is
proved in a manner satisfactory to the paying agent. If a U.S. holder does not provide a correct tax identification number, the U.S. holder may be subject
to penalties imposed by the IRS.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Generally, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules described above may be credited
against a U.S. holder’s United States federal income tax liability, if any, or refunded by the IRS provided that the required information is furnished to the
IRS in a timely manner. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisors as to the qualifications for an exemption from backup withholding and the
procedures for obtaining such exemption.

Any gain realized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax
unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a United States trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so
provides, is also attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case the non-
U.S. holder generally will be taxed at graduated United States federal income tax rates applicable to United States persons (as defined under
the Code), and, if the non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an additional branch profits tax may apply to its
effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year at the rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable
income tax treaty);
•
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder will be subject to a 30% tax on the non-U.S. holder’s gain
realized in the Merger (unless an exception is provided under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital
losses of the non-U.S. holder, if any (provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such
losses); or
•
our Common Stock constitutes a United States real property interest (“USRPI”) by reason of MoneyGram’s status as a United States real
property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and one or more other conditions are satisfied. We believe
MoneyGram currently is not a USRPHC. Because the determination of whether MoneyGram is a USRPHC depends, however, on the fair
market value of its USRPIs relative to the fair market value of our non-U.S. real property interests and our other business assets, there can
be no assurance MoneyGram currently is not a USRPHC or will not become one. Even if we are or were to become a USRPHC, gain arising
from the sale or other taxable disposition of our Common Stock by a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S.

federal income tax if our Common Stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities
market and such non-U.S. holder owned, actually, indirectly or constructively, 5% or less of our Common Stock throughout the shorter of
the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger or the non-U.S. holder’s holding period.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting, and, in certain circumstances, backup withholding may apply to the cash received pursuant to
the Merger, unless the non-U.S. holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or
reason to know that the non-U.S. holder is a United States person as defined under the Code) or such non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an
exemption. To avoid backup withholding, non-U.S. holders generally must submit a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN, “Certificate of Foreign Status of
Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding” or other applicable IRS Form W-8. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Generally, any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules described above may be credited against a non-U.S. holder’s United States federal income tax
liability, if any, or refunded by the IRS provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. Each non-U.S. holder should
consult its own tax advisors as to the qualifications for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such exemption.
The foregoing discussion of certain material United States federal income tax consequences is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal
or tax advice to any stockholder of our Common Stock. You should consult your own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to you
(including the application and effect of any state, local or non-United States income and other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of

MoneyGram board breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, entering into the Merger Agreement through an unfair process and for
inadequate compensation, and that MoneyGram aided and abetted the purported breaches of fiduciary duties. Each plaintiff seeks, among other things,
injunctive relief until the defendants to the applicable lawsuit disclose the alleged omitted material information.

On the closing date of the Merger, MoneyGram and Merger Sub will cause the Merger to be consummated by executing, delivering and filing a certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and other applicable Delaware law
and will make such other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger will become effective at such time as
the certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time on the closing date of the Merger as may be
agreed by Parent and MoneyGram and specified in the certificate of Merger.
The “marketing period” means the first period of 15 consecutive business days following the date on which all conditions precedent to the closing for the

obligations of MoneyGram under the Merger Agreement that, by their terms or nature, cannot be satisfied until the effective time, but subject to the
satisfaction or, where not prohibited, waiver by Parent, of those conditions as of the effective time will have been (and remain) satisfied or are waived, and
such 15 consecutive business day period will not commence unless Parent will have received certain financial information of MoneyGram required under
the terms of the Merger Agreement (“required financial information”) at the commencement of, or prior to, such 15 consecutive business day period (and
throughout the marketing period, certain compliance requirements (“compliance requirements”) with respect to the financial information as specified in
the Merger Agreement have been satisfied; provided that if the compliance requirements at any time fail to be satisfied during the marketing period, then
the marketing period will not be deemed to have commenced and the marketing period will only commence when the compliance requirements are
satisfied), provided that (a) certain dates and periods specified in the Merger Agreement will not be included in the calculation of the marketing period,

satisfied or waived, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that effect (stating the date it believes it completed such delivery), in which case the
marketing period will be deemed to have commenced on the date specified in the letter, unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes either (i)
MoneyGram has not completed delivery of the required financial information or (ii) such other conditions required for the commencement of the marketing
period have not been satisfied or waived, and, within three business days after receipt of such notice by MoneyGram, delivers a written notice to

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares of Common Stock then held by MoneyGram, any wholly owned subsidiary of MoneyGram, Parent, Merger
Sub or any entity of which Merger Sub is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary (such shares, the “cancelled shares”) will be cancelled and retired

In addition, to the extent required by the DGCL, any shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger and as to which the holders thereof have not voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and have properly
demanded appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn such demand (the “dissenting shares”) will not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and such holders will be entitled only to such rights and payments as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder effectively waives, withdraws, fails to properly demand or perfect, or otherwise loses
such holder’s rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, each of such holder’s dissenting shares will thereupon be deemed to have been converted at the
effective time of the Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in this proxy statement, and such holder thereof will cease to have any other rights with respect thereto. For more information regarding
appraisal rights, see the section entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights.”
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the effective

Prior to the effective time of the Merger, Parent will enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to MoneyGram with
MoneyGram’s transfer agent or a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to MoneyGram to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”). At
or immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, Parent or one of its subsidiaries will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock (other than dissenting shares or cancelled shares) and the MoneyGram LTI Awards, cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to make the aggregate payments of the Merger Consideration and LTI Award consideration required, as of the effective time of the

deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of such dissenting shares if the holder
thereof fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its right to dissent under the DGCL. The funds held by the Paying Agent will be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, to the extent such funds are not sufficient to make the payments required to be made at the
effective time of the Merger, Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so as to
ensure that it is maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the Merger (but in any event no later than three business days thereafter), Parent will cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Common Stock (other than dissenting shares or cancelled shares) that immediately prior to
the effective time of the Merger were evidenced by certificates: (i) a form of letter of transmittal and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of such certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for exchange and
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such certificate and such certificate so
surrendered will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of such certificates.
Any holder of record of shares of Common Stock (other than dissenting shares or cancelled shares) that immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger were not evidenced by certificates (“book entry shares”) will not be required to deliver a certificate or, unless reasonably requested by the Paying
Agent, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to such book entry
shares, and as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the Merger, the Paying Agent will pay and deliver to each holder of book entry
shares the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of such book entry shares, and such book entry shares will then be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of book entry shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such book entry shares.

Any person or group of persons (i) who submits an acquisition proposal to MoneyGram prior to the solicitation period end date, and (ii) whose
acquisition proposal our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with MoneyGram’s outside legal and financial advisors)
constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal, will be considered an “exempted person” for purposes of
the no solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement (as described in “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation”); provided, that a person shall
immediately cease to be considered an exempted person for purposes of the Merger Agreement upon the earlier of (a) the time (if any) at which such
acquisition proposal is withdrawn by such person or group, it being understood that a modification of an acquisition proposal submitted by a person or
group will not be deemed to be a withdrawal or termination of an acquisition proposal by such person or group so long as our board of directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with MoneyGram’s outside legal and financial advisors) that, following such modification, the acquisition
proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal and (b) 20 days following the

MoneyGram, any of its subsidiaries or the surviving parent entity in such transaction or (d) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or

account (a) the legal, financial, regulatory or other aspects of such proposal (including any financing risk, antitrust and other regulatory risks, termination
or break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, timing, conditions to consummation and certainty of closing), (b) the likelihood and timing of

than Parent and its directors, officers, employees and representatives to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any non-public information with
respect to MoneyGram or its subsidiaries previously furnished with respect to an acquisition proposal and using reasonable best efforts to cause any
such third-party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of MoneyGram or any of its subsidiaries that was furnished
by or on behalf of MoneyGram and its subsidiaries in connection with such activities, discussions or negotiations conducted with respect to any
acquisition proposal to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information pursuant to the terms of any binding agreement to do so. The
foregoing does not prevent MoneyGram from communicating with a prospective acquirer to request clarification of the terms and conditions of a possible
acquisition proposal so as to determine whether such acquisition proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. Any violation of
these restrictions by any directors, officers, employees of MoneyGram or any of its subsidiaries, or representatives acting on behalf of MoneyGram or
any of its subsidiaries, is deemed to be a breach of these restrictions by MoneyGram.
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, from the solicitation period end date until the time the MoneyGram Stockholder Approval is obtained, if
MoneyGram, any of its subsidiaries or any of their representatives receives an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal that did not result from a
breach of such foregoing restrictions and our board of directors concludes in good faith (after consultation with our outside legal and financial advisors)
that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal, MoneyGram may, and
may permit its subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees and representatives, to:

enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with the person making such acquisition proposal; and
•
furnish non-public information and afford access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and records of
MoneyGram and its subsidiaries to the person making such acquisition proposal.
Prior to MoneyGram providing (or causing to be provided) such information or affording such access to, or entering into or maintaining such discussions
or negotiations with, such person (other than informing such person of the provisions contained in the Merger Agreement or contacting such person
making any acquisition proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof), MoneyGram will have entered into an acceptable confidentiality agreement
with such person. In addition, MoneyGram will provide to Parent any non-public information relating to MoneyGram or any of its subsidiaries that was
not previously provided to Parent or made available to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within one day) after providing (or
causing to be provided) any such information to such person making or who has made such acquisition proposal and will not provide to such person
making any acquisition proposal any non-public information of or relating to Parent, Merger Subs or any of their respective affiliates or representatives.
As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within forty-eight hours after the expiration of the solicitation period end date, MoneyGram will

be an exempted person and (ii) provide Parent with a reasonably detailed summary of the material terms and conditions of any acquisition proposal
received from any exempted person prior to the solicitation period end date (it being understood that, to the extent then known, price per share,
transaction structure, closing conditions, and, to the extent part of the acquisition proposal, financing provisions will be considered material terms of any

Other than in connection with an acquisition proposal, prior to the time the MoneyGram Stockholder Approval is obtained, our board of directors may, in
response to an intervening event, make a change of recommendation if and only if:
•
prior to taking such action, our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with our and our board of directors’ outside legal and
financial advisors, that failure to take such action in light of such intervening event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law;
•
MoneyGram provides Parent prior written notice advising Parent that our board of directors intends to take such action, which notice will specify in
reasonable detail the facts underlying the MoneyGram board of directors’ determination that an intervening event has occurred and the reasons for
such change of recommendation in light of such intervening event;
•
for at least four business days after Parent’s receipt of such notice referred to in the bullet immediately above, MoneyGram has negotiated, and has
caused its financial and legal advisors (and other representatives) to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a manner that the failure to make a change of
recommendation would no longer be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with our board of directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
•
at the end of the period referred to in the bullet immediately above, our board of directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with our
outside legal and financial advisors) that failure to make a change of recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to the bullet immediately
above.
Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement prevents MoneyGram or our board of directors from (i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an acquisition
proposal or (ii) making any disclosure to MoneyGram’s stockholders if our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal advisors) that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law (it
being agreed that this clause (ii) will in no way

eliminate or modify the effect that any such disclosure would otherwise have under the Merger Agreement); provided, that in no event will MoneyGram
or our board of directors make a change of recommendation except as provided above and any public disclosure by MoneyGram or our board of directors
relating to any determination or other action by our board of directors with respect to any acquisition proposal will be deemed to be a change of
recommendation unless our board of directors expressly and concurrently reaffirms the recommendation of our board of directors.
Except as set forth above, during the period commencing with the solicitation period end date and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger, MoneyGram may not terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, MoneyGram will be permitted, without the prior written consent of Parent,
to terminate, waive, amend or modify any standstill agreement or confidentiality agreement or similar agreement to the extent the MoneyGram board of

contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
•
defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings to which it (or with respect to MoneyGram, its subsidiaries) is a

seek to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or seek to have lifted or rescinded, any injunction or restraining
order which would prevent or materially delay the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and of any substantive communication received or given in connection with any legal
proceeding by a private party regarding the Merger;

not, to the extent commercially practicable, independently participate in any meeting (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings) with any
governmental entity in respect of any approval without giving the other party or parties sufficient prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such governmental entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate in such meeting (including substantive telephonic meetings or
virtual meetings) and, in the event such party does not attend such meeting after receiving notice (including substantive telephonic or virtual
meetings), if requested, provide as promptly as practicable a reasonable summary of the substance of such meeting (including substantive
telephonic or virtual meetings); and

use reasonable best efforts to comply with agreed upon (by Parent and MoneyGram) terms and conditions of all such approvals of all such
governmental entities (including in connection with any permitted co-investor who becomes or seeks to become after the date of the Merger

Without limiting any party’s obligation to provide information to any governmental entity, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
materials provided by or on behalf of Parent to MoneyGram or its counsel or MoneyGram to Parent or its counsel may be redacted to the extent necessary
(a) to remove references concerning Parent’s or MoneyGram’s valuation analyses with respect to MoneyGram and its subsidiaries, (b) as necessary, to
comply with contracts in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement or (c) to remove personal, proprietary, privileged and other confidential business
information; provided with respect to (b) and (c), the parties will use reasonable best efforts to minimize the information or materials that cannot be
shared, to utilize customary mechanisms to permit sharing while protecting confidentiality, privilege or compliance (such as confidentiality agreements)
and to seek a waiver or disclosure if requested by the party hereto seeking disclosure.

will have the principal responsibility for determining the strategy to be pursued for obtaining, and directing the effort to obtain, all necessary actions or
non-actions and approvals from governmental entities with respect to the HSR Act, Foreign Regulatory Laws, money transmitter licenses and other
approvals in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including in connection with any permitted co-investor);
provided, however, that MoneyGram’s written consent will be required prior to the taking of any action in connection with obtaining any such approvals
if such action would result in the imposition of a burdensome condition on MoneyGram that is not waived by Parent and not conditioned on, and
effective only as of or after, the closing. MoneyGram may not, and must cause its subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement, commitment, obligation or

extent provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of MoneyGram as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement and permitted by
applicable law, all past and present directors and officers of MoneyGram or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses
if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification thereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding

For a period of six years after the effective time of the Merger, Parent will maintain, or cause the surviving corporation to maintain, for the benefit of the

lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, MoneyGram, at Parent’s expense, may at or prior to the effective time of the Merger, substitute the insurance
coverage for a single premium tail coverage with respect to such insurance that provides coverage for period of six years after the effective time of the
Merger, with terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to such Indemnified Party than the terms and conditions of the

reduce the aggregate net amount of the financing below the required financing amount, including by changing the amount of the fees to be
paid or the original issue discount of the debt financing;
•
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay or prevent the closing of the Merger or (2) make the timely funding of the
financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the financing, less likely to occur in any material respect; or
•
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the commitment letters
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent from MoneyGram will be required for: (1) any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the
debt commitment letters that is limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
debt commitment letter as of the date of the Merger Agreement (including in replacement of a Lender), (2) the implementation of a replacement
commitment facility (as defined in the debt commitment letter entered into as of the date of the Merger Agreement) so long as doing so would not
reasonably be expected to result in any of the outcomes described in the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii), (3) implementation or exercise of any “flex” provisions
provided in the fee letter as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (4) Parent or any subsidiary thereof to issue senior notes or other securities
in lieu of all or a portion of the senior bridge facility referred to in the debt commitment letter as of the date of the Merger Agreement or the issuance of
preferred equity at the closing (in lieu of the senior notes or other debt securities in lieu of a portion of the senior bridge facility) to permitted preferred
purchasers, or (5) permitted co-investors being added to the equity commitment letter or delivering an equity commitment letter of their own in
substantially similar form (except for amount) to the equity commitment letter for a portion of the equity financing; and provided further, notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, in no event in and of itself will a permitted co-investor becoming, or seeking to
become (including in connection with seeking any approval required to become in
104Table of Contents
connection with the Merger), a direct or indirect equity investor in Parent or its affiliates after the date of the Merger Agreement and effective prior to or
as of the closing be deemed to result in the outcomes described in the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii).
The “required financing amount” means the funds necessary to satisfy Parent’s and Merger Sub’s payment obligations under the Merger Agreement at
the effective time of the Merger, including payment in cash of the aggregate Merger Consideration and LTI award consideration payable at the effective
time of the Merger, refinancing of MoneyGram’s indebtedness outstanding under the credit agreement (as defined in “The Merger Agreement—
Treatment of Certain Existing Indebtedness”) and the 2021 first lien notes (as defined in “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Certain Existing
Indebtedness”) (in each case, including all applicable interest, fees and premiums), and to pay all related fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger, in each case, at the effective time of the Merger.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain the financing
on a timely basis (taking into account the marketing period), but in any event no later than the effective time of the Merger, on the terms and conditions
(including, to the extent required, the full exercise of any “flex” provisions in any fee letter) described in the commitment letters, including, but not limited
to, using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the commitment letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii)
negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter and related fee letter
on a timely basis (taking account of the marketing period) on the terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions in the related fee letter)
contemplated by the debt commitment letter and related fee letter (or any other terms acceptable to Parent so long as Parent remains in compliance with
the requirements described in this paragraph); (iii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions contained in the debt commitment letter
and related fee letter and such definitive agreements related thereto within the control of Parent or Merger Sub and in the equity commitment letter on or
prior to the effective time of the Merger; (iv) in the event that all conditions contained in the commitment letters (other than, with respect to the debt
financing, the availability of the cash equity contribution) have been satisfied and Parent is required to consummate the closing pursuant to Merger
Agreement and the marketing period has been completed, consummate the financing at or prior to the closing, including using reasonable best efforts to
cause the lenders to fund the debt financing at the closing; (v) comply with its obligations pursuant to the commitment letters on or prior to effective time
of the Merger; and (vi) enforce its rights pursuant to the commitment letters. Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all
commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the commitment letters as and when they become due.
As set forth in the Merger Agreement, Parent will (i) keep MoneyGram informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the financing; and (ii) provide MoneyGram with copies of all definitive agreements and other documents related to the debt financing.
If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable (other than as a result of a breach by MoneyGram of the Merger Agreement), on the terms and
conditions (including any “flex” and “securities demand” provisions in any fee letter) contemplated in the debt commitment letter and related fee letter,
Parent will promptly notify MoneyGram in writing (but in any event within two business days after obtaining knowledge of the occurrence or discovery
thereof) and Parent and Merger Sub will use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
such event, (i) arrange and obtain the debt financing or such portion of the debt financing from the same or alternative sources (A) on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the debt commitment letter and related fee
letter and (B) containing conditions to draw at closing that would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability thereof that (1) are not
more onerous than those conditions and terms contained in the debt commitment letter and related fee letter, (2) would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the closing or make the closing materially less likely to occur, and (3) in an amount at least
105
Table of Contents
equal to the debt financing or such unavailable portion thereof, but in no event more than the required financing amount if such amount is less, as the
case may be (the “alternate debt financing”); and (ii) obtain one or more new debt financing commitment letters with respect to such alternate debt
financing (the “new debt commitment letters”), which new letters will replace the existing debt commitment letter in whole or in part.
In no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to (A) seek cash equity from any source other than those
counterparty to the equity commitment letter, or in any amount with respect to a Guarantor in excess of such Guarantor’s commitment, (B) pay any fees in
excess of those contemplated by the commitment letters, or (C) agree to economic terms of the alternate debt financing (including any “flex” provisions
relating thereto) that are less favorable in the aggregate than those contemplated by the debt commitment letter or any related fee letter (after giving effect
to any “flex” provisions therein). Parent will promptly provide a copy of any new debt commitment letter (and any fee letter in connection therewith or
other agreements related thereto (with customary redactions)) to MoneyGram.
Subject to, and without limiting or modifying, the provisions described in “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning
on page 109 of this proxy statement below, obtaining the financing is not a condition to Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger
Agreement.

such conditions are capable of being satisfied), (ii) on or after the date the closing should have occurred pursuant to the Merger Agreement
(taking into account the marketing period), MoneyGram has delivered irrevocable written notice to Parent confirming that (a) all the
conditions to Parent’s obligation to complete the transaction have been satisfied or waived by Parent (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the closing; provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied), (b) all the conditions to
MoneyGram’s obligation to complete the transaction have been satisfied or waived by MoneyGram (other than those conditions that by

prior to obtaining the MoneyGram Stockholder Approval, (i) our board of directors authorizes MoneyGram, subject to complying with the
terms of the Merger Agreement, to enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect a transaction constituting a superior proposal, (ii) prior
to or concurrently with such termination of the Merger Agreement pays to Parent in immediately available funds the applicable termination
fee described below in “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” and (iii) MoneyGram enters into such binding definitive
agreement substantially concurrently with or immediately after such termination (MoneyGram’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement
pursuant to this sub-bullet is referred to as the “superior proposal termination right”).
Prior to the time MoneyGram Stockholder Approval is obtained, our board of directors may terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a
binding definitive agreement to effect a transaction constituting a superior proposal (and make a change of recommendation with respect thereto), if and
only if:
•
MoneyGram receives an acquisition proposal (regardless of whether from an exempted person) that did not result from a material breach of certain
of the no solicitation provisions in the Merger Agreement and our board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
MoneyGram’s outside legal and financial advisors) that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal;
•
MoneyGram provides Parent prior written notice of MoneyGram’s intention to terminate the Merger Agreement, which notice must identify the
person making such superior proposal and include the price and material terms and conditions of such superior proposal, including copies of any
written proposals or offers and any proposed agreements related thereto;
•
for at least four business days after Parent’s receipt of such notice referred to in the bullet immediately above, MoneyGram has negotiated, and has
caused its financial and legal advisors (and other representatives) to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that such acquisition proposal ceases to constitute a superior
proposal (provided that any revision to the financial terms or any other material term of such superior proposal will require a new notice referred to
in the bullet immediately above and MoneyGram will be required to comply again with the provisions of this bullet with respect to such new notice,
except that such time period referred to in this bullet will be two business days (rather than four business days)); and
•
at the end of the period (or periods) referred to in the bullet immediately above, our board of directors has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with MoneyGram’s outside legal and financial advisors) that
113
Table of Contents
such acquisition proposal still constitutes a superior proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant
to the bullet immediately above and that a failure to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such superior proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that
MoneyGram provide its stockholders with the opportunity to vote on an advisory, non-binding proposal to approve compensation that will or may
become payable to MoneyGram’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger—Interests of MoneyGram’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
MoneyGram is asking its stockholders to indicate their approval of the various “change of control” payments and other compensation which
MoneyGram’s named executive officers will or may be eligible to receive in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the table entitled
“Golden Parachute Compensation” under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger—Interests of MoneyGram’s Executive Officers and
Directors in the Merger” and the accompanying footnotes.
Accordingly, MoneyGram is seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of MoneyGram approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to
MoneyGram’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K
in the section of this proxy statement entitled ‘The Merger—Interests of MoneyGram’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger’.”
Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger. Stockholders should note that this non-binding proposal regarding Merger-
related compensation is merely an advisory vote that will not be binding on MoneyGram or Parent, their respective boards of directors or compensation
committees. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, if the Merger is consummated, MoneyGram’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms or conditions applicable to such compensation, even if this proposal is not approved.
Approval of this proposal requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal at the special meeting, assuming a quorum is
present. For this proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will be counted as present for the purpose of determining
whether a quorum is present at the special meeting but will have no effect on the approval of the non-binding proposal. The failure to instruct your bank,
broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will also not have any effect on this proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting. If our stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we
could adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including
soliciting proxies from our stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the special
meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in
favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the
discretion of the chairman of the special meeting.
Approval of this proposal requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal at the special meeting, assuming a quorum is
present. For this proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will be counted as present for the purpose of determining
whether a quorum is present at the special meeting but will have no effect on the approval of the proposal. We do not expect to receive any broker non-
votes on this proposal. The failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will also not have any effect on this proposal.

arrangements that provide for the issuance of equity or equity-based awards, the “Company Stock Plan”) whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of which has an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration and therefore is
expected to have no intrinsic value at the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
automatically be cancelled and retired and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, and the Company shall have no further
obligations with respect to such Company Option Award.

by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically become fully vested and be canceled in exchange for the
right to receive, at the Effective Time and in full satisfaction of the Company’s obligations with respect to such Pre-2023 Company Time-Based RSU
Award, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares

(c) Pre-2023 Performance-Vesting RSUs. At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting granted prior to

of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically become vested as to a number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such Pre-2023 Company Performance-Based RSU Award based on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement
at the greater of the target level and the actual level of performance achieved immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be canceled in
consideration for the right to receive, at the Effective Time and in full satisfaction of the Company’s obligations with respect to such Pre-2023 Company
Performance-Based RSU Award, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration
and (ii) such vested number of shares of Common Stock.
(d) Cash-Based Awards. At the Effective Time, each performance-based cash award granted prior to January 1, 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan,
whether vested or unvested, representing the right to receive cash payments, whether subject to performance-based vesting requirements or time-based
vesting requirements (each, a “Pre-2023 Company Performance Cash Award”), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically become fully vested and be canceled in exchange for the right to
receive, at the Effective Time and in full satisfaction of the Company’s obligations with respect to such Pre-2023 Company Performance Cash Award, an
amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the aggregate cash amount payable pursuant to such Pre-2023 Company
Performance Cash Award based on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement at the greater of the target level
and the actual level of performance achieved immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each performance-based cash award granted on or after January 1,
2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, representing the right to receive cash payments, whether subject to performance-
based vesting requirements or time-based vesting requirements, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall continue in accordance
with its terms.
(e) 2023 RSUs. At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units subject to either time-based or performance-based vesting granted in or
following calendar year 2023 pursuant to the Company Stock Plan representing the right to receive shares of Common Stock (including any award
originally subject to performance-based vesting for which the performance period has been completed and performance threshold satisfied and which is
now subject solely to time-based vesting) (each, a “2023 Company RSU”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by Parent and the holder of such 2023 Company RSU, automatically be converted into a cash-settled long-term incentive award (a
“Converted Award”), representing a right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the
number of Shares underlying such 2023 Company RSU (and, with respect to any such 2023 Company RSU, that is subject to performance based vesting,
such number of Shares will be based on achievement of the performance criteria set forth in the applicable award agreement at the greater of the target
level and the actual level of performance achieved immediately prior to the Effective Time), on the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to such
2023 Company RSU immediately before the Effective Time (it being understood that the Merger will not in and of itself constitute a single-trigger
acceleration, vesting or payment event with respect to such Shares). On the date, and to the extent, that the Converted Award becomes vested, such
vested Converted Award shall be paid, subject to any applicable withholding taxes, as soon as practicable thereafter (but in any event not later than the
second regular payroll date thereafter). The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide for the foregoing actions.
(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Pre-2023 Company Time-Based RSU Awards,

Section 2.4(b), (c) or (d), as applicable (the “LTI Award Consideration”) and cancellation of such Company LTI Awards as of the Effective Time. The
Company will ensure that, following the Effective Time, no participant in the Company Stock Plan or otherwise will have any right thereunder to acquire
any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of Section 2.4(b), Section 2.4(c) and
Section 2.4(e) shall apply to all Pre-2023 Company Time-Based RSU Awards, all Pre-2023 Company Performance-Based RSU Awards and all 2023 Company
RSUs except as otherwise agreed to in writing signed prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of a Pre-2023 Company Time-Based RSU Award, a
Pre-2023 Company Performance-Based RSU Award or a 2023 Company RSU.
2.5. Dissenting Shares.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent required by the DGCL, any shares of Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and as to which the holders thereof have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
have properly demanded appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively,
“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1, and such holders shall be
entitled only to such rights and payments as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall effectively waive,
withdraw, not properly demand or perfect or otherwise lose such holder’s rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, each of such holder’s Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1,
without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided herein, and such holder thereof shall cease to have any other rights
with respect thereto. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided
in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence.
(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written notices received by the Company prior to the Effective Time with respect to any intent to
demand or written demands for appraisal with respect to any shares of Common Stock, attempts to withdraw such notices or demands and any other
instruments or notices served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law relating to stockholders’ appraisal rights. Parent shall have the
right to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law
relating to stockholders’ appraisal rights. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an Order of a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, make any payment or other commitment with respect to any such demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal, resolution or settlement of any such demands.
2.6. Paying Agent.
(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Company’s
transfer agent or a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”). At or immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares), Company LTI Awards and Company Warrants, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to
make the aggregate payments required to be made at the Effective Time pursuant to this Article II. With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall
only be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Dissenting Shares if the holder thereof fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its right to dissent under the DGCL. The funds
held by the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, to the extent such funds are not sufficient to
make the payments required to be made at the Effective Time pursuant to this Article II, Parent shall, or shall cause the
A-5
Table of Contents
Surviving Company to, promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments.
(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares) or Company Warrants, in each case, that
immediately prior to the Effective Time were evidenced by certificates (the “Certificates”): (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Warrant Consideration, as applicable.
Upon proper surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.6(g)) for exchange and cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares or the Warrant Consideration in respect of the Company Warrants formerly represented by such Certificate and
such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger
Consideration or Warrant Consideration, as applicable, payable upon the surrender of the Certificates.
(c) Any holder of record of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares) or Company Warrants, in each case, that immediately prior to the
Effective Time were not evidenced by certificates (the “Book Entry Shares”) shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or, unless reasonably requested
by the Paying Agent, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration or Warrant
Consideration, as applicable, with respect to such Book Entry Shares, and as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent
shall pay and deliver to each holder of Book Entry Shares the aggregate Merger Consideration or Warrant Consideration, as applicable, in respect of such
Book Entry Shares, and such Book Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Book Entry Shares
on the Merger Consideration or Warrant Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect of such Book Entry Shares.
(d) If the payment of the Merger Consideration or Warrant Consideration, as applicable, is to be made to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor or the registered holder of Book Entry Shares, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book
Entry Shares shall be properly transferred, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent in advance any applicable stock
transfer or other Taxes or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.
(e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the transfer books of the Company of the Shares or Company Warrants that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such securities are presented for transfer to
the Paying Agent, Surviving Company or Parent they shall be (subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Article II) cancelled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration or the Warrant Consideration, as applicable, as provided in this Article II. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares and Company Warrants, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares and Company Warrants except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
(f) Any portion of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.6(a) (including any interest or other proceeds of any investment
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the Securityholders twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of Parent, to Parent or as
directed by Parent. Any Securityholders who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for
payment of the Merger Consideration, LTI Award Consideration or the Warrant
A-6
Table of Contents
Consideration, as applicable, in respect of the Shares, Company LTI Awards or Company Warrants held by such Securityholder at the Effective Time as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former Securityholder for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent
or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any Claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration or the Warrant Consideration, as
applicable, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
2.7. Withholding. Each of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient of the payment in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.
2.8. Certain Adjustments. Without limiting the obligations of the Company under this Agreement (including Section 5.1), if between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of Shares or the number of Shares issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any issued and
outstanding securities of the Company (including the Company Option Awards, Company LTI Awards and Company Warrants) are changed into a
different number or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration, LTI Award Consideration and any other dependent
items, as applicable, shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration, Warrant Consideration, LTI Award Consideration or other dependent item, as applicable; provided, that in no event will the aggregate
Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration, LTI Award Consideration or other payments required to be made under this Article II increase as a result
of any such adjustment.

customarily redacted; provided, however, that no provisions that, or that could reasonably be expected to, adversely affect the availability of or impose
additional conditions on, the availability of the Debt Financing at the Effective Time may be redacted), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to
provide to Parent and/or Merger Sub, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (the “Debt Financing”
and, together with the Equity Financing, the “Financing”). There are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts, understandings or arrangements to

each of the Guarantors, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each case, except as
enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity, whether applied in a court of Law or a court of equity, and by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors’ rights and remedies generally; (ii) each Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified in any respect and no such amendment or modification is contemplated or pending (other than amendments or modifications to the Debt
Commitment Letter solely (A) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities, (B) in connection with the
implementation of any “market flex” provisions or “securities demand” terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (C) to implement a Replacement

Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the Parent, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
would reasonably be expected to constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent to be satisfied by any Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub, as

and Merger Sub’s payment obligations under this Agreement at the Effective Time, including payment in cash of the aggregate Merger Consideration,
Warrant Consideration and LTI Award Consideration payable at the Effective Time, refinancing of the Company’s indebtedness outstanding under the

expenses required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger, in each case, at the Effective Time (such amount, the “Required
Financing Amount”).

of each of the Guarantors. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of any Guarantor under the Limited Guarantee.
4.10. Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub or any Guarantor is entering into the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in Article III, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the Merger and (iii) that the most
recent financial forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries made available to Parent were prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were, at
the time made, reasonable and after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (a) the aggregate value of the assets of
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will exceed total liabilities (including contingent and unmatured liabilities) of the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) at a fair valuation and at fair saleable value; (b) the Surviving Company will have the
ability to pay its total debts and liabilities (including contingent and unmatured liabilities) as they become due in the usual course of its business; and (c)

business. For purposes of this Section 4.10, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct their business” and “have the
ability to pay its total debts and liabilities (including contingent and unmatured liabilities) as they become due in the usual course of its business” means

obligations as they become due.

more of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries (treating for purposes of the foregoing
all securities that are convertible into equity securities of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries as fully converted), except where such
foreign person or foreign entity is a minority, non-controlling investor in Parent or another entity that is managed and controlled, directly or indirectly, by
Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, as general partner or managing member, and such investment by a “foreign person” or “foreign entity” satisfies the
requirements of 31 C.F.R. § 800.307(a).

properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to provide such access or furnish

practicable. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly advise the Company if at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any
information provided by it or the Guarantors for use in the Proxy Statement is or becomes false, incomplete or misleading in any material respect and to
provide the Company with the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. The Company agrees to advise Parent if at any time prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting any information provided by it in the Proxy Statement is or becomes false, incomplete or misleading in any material
respect and to supplement the Proxy Statement with the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. The Company shall as soon as
reasonably practicable notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and of
any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all such
comments and correspondence. Prior to filing or mailing the definitive Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to comment
on such document or response and shall consider in good faith any such comments reasonably proposed by Parent. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish
to the Company all information concerning themselves, their respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders (including the Guarantors) and
such other matters as may be necessary to comply with applicable Law in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company, Parent

Stockholders Meeting, in each case as promptly as practicable following the date the SEC confirms it has no further comments to the preliminary Proxy
Statement. Except to the extent there has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with and subject to Section 5.4, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of approval of the Merger and secure any other approval of stockholders of the
Company that is required by applicable Law in connection with the Merger; provided, however, that (i) the Company may change the date of, postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (but not to a date later than the End Date (as may be extended under Section 7.1(c))) to the extent that it
has reasonably determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Parent (and its outside counsel), that such postponement or adjournment
is necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company’s stockholders within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (ii) the Company may (and if Parent so requests, the Company shall on
up to two occasions up to ten (10) Business Days each), change the date of, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (but not to a date
later than the Business Day prior to the End Date (as may be extended under Section 7.1(c)), and provided that the Company shall not be required to set a
new record date) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (a) there are insufficient shares of Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (b) at
such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, the obligation of the Company
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and mail the definitive Proxy Statement (and any amendment or
supplement that may be required by Law) to the Company’s stockholders shall not be affected by a Change of Recommendation (as defined below). In
addition to the foregoing, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII.
5.4. No Solicitation.

Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the thirtieth (30th) day thereafter (the “Solicitation Period End Date”), the Company
shall have the right to, and may cause its Subsidiaries and the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective directors, officers, employees and
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the submission of any inquiries, proposals or

any of its affiliates shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, participate in discussions
with, any person (or group that includes any person) that prior to the execution of this Agreement directly or indirectly, whether through its affiliates or
Representatives, (1) accessed the on-line data room hosted on behalf of the Company in connection with evaluating a potential acquisition of the
Company, (2) participated in substantive negotiations with the Company or its Representatives regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal or (3)
submitted a Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company or its Representatives, in each case within 180 days prior to the date of this Agreement (any

communications or solicitations regarding (i) a Company Acquisition Proposal or (ii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with
Section 5.8. The Company will substantially concurrently make available to Parent or its Representatives any non-public information

causing to be provided) any such information pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) and shall not provide to any such person any non-public information of or
relating to Parent, Merger Subs or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives.

efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ respective directors, officers, employees and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) initiate, solicit,

constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (b) engage in, conduct or knowingly facilitate any discussions

relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (c) furnish to any person (other than to Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) any
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any person access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees
of Parent or Merger Sub), in any such case with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or
assist, a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or efforts, or the making, of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (d) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Company Acquisition Proposal (any act described in this clause (d), a “Change of Recommendation”), (e) waive the applicability of all or any portion of
any anti-takeover Laws in respect of any person (other than Parent and its affiliates), (f) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent or other document or Contract related to any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable

otherwise contemplated that the Company) abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations
hereunder, or (g) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Except (1) as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4 or (2) with respect to any
Exempted Person until the date that is twenty (20) days following the Solicitation Period End Date, from the Solicitation Period End Date until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and
will instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ directors, officers, employees and Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives to continue, any and all activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted with any persons other than Parent with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, including immediately revoking or
withdrawing access of any person other than Parent and its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to any data room (virtual or actual)
containing any non-public information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries previously furnished with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal and using reasonable best efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with such activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such
information pursuant to the terms of any binding agreement to do so. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing will not prevent the Company from
communicating with a prospective acquirer to request clarification of the terms and conditions of a possible Company Acquisition Proposal so as to
determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to
A-39

a Company Superior Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of this Section 5.4 by any directors, officers, employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Representatives acting on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.4 by the Company.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 5.4(b), from the Solicitation Period End Date until the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, if the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives receives an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.4 and the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal
and financial advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees and Representatives, to (i)
enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) furnish non-public information
and afford access to the business, employees, officers, Contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
person making such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that (a) prior to providing (or causing to be provided) such information or
affording such access to, or entering into or maintaining such discussions or negotiations with, such person (other than informing such person of the
provisions contained in this Section 5.4 or contacting such person making any Company Acquisition Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof), the Company shall have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person and (b) the Company will provide to Parent any
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to Parent as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but in any event within one (1) day) after providing (or causing to be provided) any such information to such person making or
who has made such Company Acquisition Proposal and shall not provide to such person making any Company Acquisition Proposal any non-public
information of or relating to Parent, Merger Subs or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives.
(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours after the expiration of the Solicitation Period End Date, the
Company shall (i) notify Parent in writing of the identity of each person, if any, that, in accordance with this Agreement, the Company Board has
determined to be an Exempted Person and (ii) provide Parent with a reasonably detailed summary of the material terms and conditions of any Company
Acquisition Proposal received from any Exempted Person prior to the Solicitation Period End Date (it being understood that, to the extent then known,
price per share, transaction structure, closing conditions, and, to the extent part of the Company Acquisition Proposal, financing provisions shall be
considered material terms of any such Company Acquisition Proposal). In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing
promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) after (a) receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry, request, proposal or
offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal) that the Company receives after the Solicitation Period End Date,
which notice shall include the identity of the person making such proposal or offer, a summary of the material terms of all such proposals or offers and
copies of drafts of proposed agreements, term sheets or letters of intent related thereto received by the Company, (b) of any change to the financial or
other material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal received after the Solicitation Period End Date, and the Company shall
otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of developments with respect to, and the status of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal (including by
providing copies of all proposals, offers and drafts of proposed agreements related thereto that have not already been provided pursuant to clauses (a)
and (b) above) and (c) receipt by the Company or its Representatives of any request for non-public information received after the Solicitation Period End
Date relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries’ properties, books or records by any
person in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry, request, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Acquisition Proposal). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or
other agreement or obligation that would prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.

Recommendation with respect thereto), if and only if:
(i) the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether from an Exempted Person) that did not result from a material

extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any revision to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the provisions of this Section 5.4(e) with respect to such new notice, except that such Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days (rather
than four (4) Business Days)); and
(iv) at the end of the period (or periods) referred to in clause (iii) above, the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
the Company’s outside legal and financial advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a Company Superior Proposal after
giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (iii) above and that a failure to terminate this Agreement in
order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(f) Other than in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.4(e) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.4(f)),
prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, make a Change of
Recommendation if and only if (i) prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s and the
Company Board’s outside legal and financial advisors, that failure to take such action in light of such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board
intends to take such action (a “Change of Recommendation Notice”), which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying the Company
Board’s determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and the reasons for such Change of Recommendation in light of such Intervening Event;
(iii) for at least four (4) Business Days after Parent’s receipt of a Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
financial and legal advisors (and other Representatives) to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation would no longer be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (iv) at the end of the period referred to in
clause (iii) above, the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal and financial advisors) that
failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law after giving
effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (iii) above.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal (it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself constitute a Change of Recommendation) or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Company’s stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that the
failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (including any legally
required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or a Company Acquisition Proposal) (it being agreed
that this clause (ii) shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any such disclosure would otherwise have under this Agreement); provided, that in
no event shall the Company or the Company Board make a Change of Recommendation except as provided in Section 5.4(e) or Section 5.4(f) and any
public disclosure by the Company or the Company Board relating to any determination or other action by the Company Board with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms the
Company Recommendation.
(h) Except as set forth in Section 5.4(a), during the period commencing with the Solicitation Period End Date and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision
of any Standstill Agreement or confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party, in each case, with respect to the submission of any Company
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted, without the prior written
consent of Parent, to terminate, waive, amend or modify any Standstill Agreement or confidentiality agreement or similar agreement to the extent the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal and financial advisors, that failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
5.5. Reasonable Best Efforts.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of the other provisions of this Section 5.5 and of this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall use their reasonable best efforts to: (i) consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) prepare as promptly as practicable (and file, submit or effect, or cause to be filed, submitted or effected, as
applicable) all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests and other documents in order to obtain (and to cooperate with the other
parties to obtain) any Approval from any Governmental Entity which is required or advisable to be obtained by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including as may be required under the HSR Act, any Money
Transmitter Requirements or Foreign Regulatory Laws as set forth in Section 3.4(a)(iii) or Section 3.4(a)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (iii)
comply promptly with all Legal Requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect to obtaining Approvals for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings to which it (or with respect to the
Company, its Subsidiaries) is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(v) seek to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or seek to have lifted or rescinded, any injunction or restraining
Order which would prevent or materially delay the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (vi) seek to
resolve any objection or assertion by any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof: (x) make (or cause to be made) an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, which filing shall in any event be made within thirty (30) days following the date hereof,
(y) make such filings and submissions as set forth on Section 5.5(a)(y) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (and, subject to the final three sentences of
this
A-42
Table of Contents
Section 5.5(a), such other filings and submissions not set forth on Section 5.5(a)(y) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) in each case to the extent
required by applicable Money Transmitter Requirements with respect to obtaining Approvals related to Money Transmitter Licenses of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (the “Money Transfer Change of Control Filings”), in each case with respect to a change in control of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that holds a Money Transmitter License, and (z) make (or cause to be made) such filings pursuant to any Foreign Regulatory Laws solely as
set forth on Section 5.5(a)(z) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (“Foreign Regulatory Filings”). With respect to any Money Transfer Change of Control
Filings not set forth on Section 5.5(a)(y) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Foreign Regulatory Filings not set forth on Section 5.5(a)(z) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (including in connection with any Permitted Co-Investor), each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts and cooperate with the other parties hereto (A) in timely making inquiries with Governmental Entities regarding the Money
Transfer Change of Control Filings or Foreign Regulatory Filings (if and to the extent necessary to determine if a filing is required or advisable in
connection with the Merger), (B) in determining if any Money Transfer Change of Control Filings or Foreign Regulatory Filings are not required by
Governmental Entities in connection with the Merger, and (C) if obtaining Approval under such Money Transfer Change of Control Filings or such
Foreign Regulatory Filings would not reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition (as defined below), in timely making all Money
Transfer Change of Control Filings or Foreign Regulatory Filings required to be made by it (except with respect to such jurisdictions where the parties
agree that a Money Transfer Change of Control Filing or any Approval from Governmental Entity that issues, grants or administers Money Transmitter
Licenses or Foreign Regulatory Filing is not required or advisable). The Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, without Parent’s prior
written consent, take any action within its or their control that would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition. Parent will not, without
the Company’s prior written consent, agree to a Burdensome Condition on the Company that is not conditioned on the occurrence of and effective only
as of or after, the Closing and that is not waived when agreed to by Parent as a condition to the Closing.
(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including those set forth elsewhere in this Section 5.5, each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other parties hereto (including in connection
with any Permitted Co-Investor), (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, promptly inform the other party or parties of any
substantive communication (oral and written) received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity with respect to any such
filing or Approval or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including keeping the other parties apprised, on a current basis of the status of
such filing or Approval, including the Money Transfer Change of Control Filings, filings under the HSR Act and any Foreign Regulatory Filings), and of
any substantive communication received or given in connection with any legal proceeding by a private party regarding the Merger, (iii) consult with and
consider in good faith the views of the other party or parties (subject to applicable Legal Requirements relating to the exchange of information) in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party relating to proceedings with respect to any such Approvals or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) to use reasonable best
efforts to, and to cause their respective affiliates and Representatives to, furnish to the other party or parties and to any Governmental Entities such
information and assistance as may be requested in connection with the foregoing, including by responding promptly to and complying with any
reasonable request for additional information or documents under any applicable Legal Requirements, (v) not, to the extent commercially practicable,
independently participate in any meeting (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings) with any Governmental Entity in respect of any Approval
without giving the other party or parties sufficient prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity
to attend and/or participate in such meeting (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings), and, in the event such party does not attend such
meeting after receiving notice (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings), if requested, provide as promptly as practicable a reasonable
summary of the substance of such meeting (including substantive telephonic or virtual meetings), and (vi) to use reasonable best efforts to comply with
agreed-upon (by Parent and the Company) terms and conditions of all such Approvals of all such Governmental Entities (including in connection with
any Permitted Co-Investor who becomes or seeks to become after the date of this Agreement an equity investor in
A-43
Table of Contents
Parent as of the Closing (giving effect to the Merger)). Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from
any Governmental Entity whose consent, non-objection or approval is required or asserted to be required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any consent, non-objection or approval will
not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed or conditioned. Without limiting any party’s obligation to provide
information to any Governmental Entity, notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 to the contrary, materials provided by or on behalf of Parent to the
Company or its counsel or the Company to Parent or its counsel may be redacted to the extent necessary (a) to remove references concerning Parent’s or
the Company’s valuation analyses with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) as necessary to comply with Contracts in effect on the date
hereof or (c) to remove personal, proprietary, privileged and other confidential business information; provided with respect to (b) and (c), the parties will
use reasonable best efforts to minimize the information or materials that cannot be shared, to utilize customary mechanisms to permit sharing while
protecting confidentiality, privilege or compliance (such as confidentiality agreements) and to seek a waiver or disclosure if requested by the party hereto
seeking disclosure.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent after, to the extent permitted by law, consulting in good faith with the Company and
considering in good faith the Company’s views and comments, shall have the principal responsibility for determining the strategy to be pursued for
obtaining, and directing the effort to obtain, all necessary actions or non-actions and Approvals from Governmental Entities with respect to the HSR Act,
Foreign Regulatory Laws, Money Transmitter Licenses and other Approvals in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including in connection with any Permitted Co-Investor); provided, however, that the Company’s written consent shall be required prior to the taking of
any action in connection with obtaining any such Approvals if such action would result in the imposition of a Burdensome Condition on the Company
that is not waived by Parent and not conditioned on, and effective only as of or after, the Closing. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement, commitment, obligation or settlement with any Governmental Entity (including any Governmental Entity
that issues, grants, or administers Money Transmitter Licenses) with respect to any Approvals required hereunder (including the Money Transfer
Change of Control Filings or Foreign Regulatory Filings) without Parent’s prior written consent.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require (or be deemed to
require or interpreted as requiring) Parent or any of its affiliates to agree to or take (nor shall the Company or its Subsidiaries, without Parent’s prior
written consent, take or agree to take or be required to take prior to or after the Closing) any action, make any agreement, settlement, or commitment,
provide any consent for any reason, or suffer any restriction, obligation, liability or other detriment, with respect to obtaining Money Transmitter
Licenses, Approvals in connection with the HSR Act, the Foreign Regulatory Filings or any other Approvals required in connection with the Merger
(including in connection with any Permitted Co-Investor) that when taken, whether in and of itself or collectively with any other obligation or action taken
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, would, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (A) have a
Material Adverse Effect, (B) require the Guarantors, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to incur economic detriment
(including through making payments, losing or forgoing revenue or earnings, divesting assets, incurring liabilities or limitations on operations, or
otherwise) of more than $30,000,000 in the aggregate for all such persons when taken together with all such other economic detriments incurred in
complying with this Agreement, (C) prevent the utilization of the Financing at and after the Closing as contemplated in the Commitment Letters (and the
definitive agreements contemplated thereby) (including with respect to collateral security and ratings), (D) require any information to be provided by, or
any restriction to be borne by, a person that is not delivering an Equity Commitment Letter or who is not a director or officer of Parent, the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including from and after the Closing) or a Managing Director or officer of Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, or any Permitted Co-Investor
that will own, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of the equity interests of the Company, or any person who will serve as a director or executive officer of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (E) require Parent or its affiliates to seek prior approval of any transactions, investments,
mergers or acquisitions from any Governmental Entity for any period of time, other than the Money Transfer Change of
A-44
Table of Contents
Control Filings and Foreign Regulatory Filings contemplated by this Agreement (any such arrangements, conditions or restrictions, a “Burdensome
Condition”). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to (and without the prior
consent of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not), take any action with respect to any Order or any applicable Law or in order to obtain any
Approval which is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. In connection with Parent invoking a Burdensome Condition, the parties and
their respective Representatives shall meet and confer for a reasonable amount of time in context in good faith in order to (i) exchange and review their
respective views and positions as to such Burdensome Condition and (ii) discuss and present to, and engage with, the applicable Governmental Entity
regarding any potential approaches or workarounds that would avoid such Burdensome Condition or mitigate its impact so it is no longer a Burdensome
Condition, (it being understood that this sentence shall not eliminate, limit, delay or impair Parent’s right to invoke a Burdensome Condition if such
potential approaches or workarounds are not acceptable to Parent in its sole and absolute discretion or could otherwise cause Parent to breach its
obligations hereunder) and all such discussions will be treated in all respects as governed by and subject to Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence or
any applicable equivalent state, foreign or local statute.
(e) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.5 but subject in all respects to Section 5.5(d), each party hereto shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents or approvals from any third parties (other than Governmental Entities) not otherwise
contemplated in Section 5.5(a) that are necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the parties
hereto shall fail to obtain any such third party consent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Parent to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and its Subsidiaries resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to result,
after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with
obtaining any such approval or consent from any persons (other than Governmental Entities) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to, or, without the prior written consent of Parent, shall, pay or commit to
pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such person, and (ii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such person
whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.
5.6. Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.
(a) During the 12-month period following the Effective Time (the “Protection Period”), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide to the
Company Employees who are employees of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company at the Effective Time (such Company Employees, “Continuing
Employees”), while such Continuing Employees remain employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, (i) base salary or wages and cash incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable, in each instance, to those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
and (ii) employee benefits (other than any defined benefit pension benefits or supplemental executive retirement plan benefits) that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing.
(b) During the Protection Period, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to assume and honor the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ obligations
under all employment, severance, and bonus agreements, if any, between the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, on the one hand, and a
Continuing Employee, on the other hand, immediately prior to the Effective Time, including but not limited to the MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc.
Severance Plan as in effect as of the Effective Time (the “Company Severance Plan”). Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide the
severance payments and benefits set forth in the Company Severance Plan to any Continuing Employees who are terminated during the Protection Period
and neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall decrease the severance payments and benefits payable under the Company Severance Plan during
the Protection Period.
A-45
Table of Contents
(c) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits (other than for vesting purposes under any equity-
based or incentive compensation Plan)) with respect to each applicable employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Company (the “Parent Plans”), if any, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and vacation entitlement (but
not for accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan or post-retirement welfare benefit plan), service with the Company or any Subsidiary
(or any predecessor entity thereto) shall be treated as service with Parent to the same extent recognized by the Company under a comparable Plan;
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under applicable law, Parent shall not be required to provide credit for such service for benefit
accrual purposes under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent that is a defined benefit pension plan, postretirement welfare plan or
grandfathered plan (or other plan that is no longer open to new participants). Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting
periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations with respect to any Parent Plan. Each Parent
Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods to the same extent waived under the applicable Plan. The Continuing
Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Plan of the Company or any Subsidiary during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Parent Plan during the applicable plan year.
(d) The provisions of this Section 5.6 are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and nothing in this Section 5.6, express or implied, shall confer upon
any Continuing Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.6,
express or implied, shall be deemed an amendment of any Plan.
5.7. Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and permitted by applicable Law, all
past and present directors and officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any losses, Claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification
hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative (in each case whether asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time), arising out of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Party serving as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including in connection with an Indemnified Party serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee, trustee or partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other entity and including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).
(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain or cause the Surviving Company to maintain for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (from the Company’s current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating, as of the Closing Date, as the Company’s current insurance carrier) that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) with terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to such Indemnified
Parties than the terms and conditions of the existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy of the Company; provided that, at Parent’s option, in
lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company, at Parent’s expense, may at or prior to the Effective Time substitute
A-46
Table of Contents
therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to the D&O Insurance that provides coverage for period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, with
terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to such Indemnified Parties than the terms and conditions of the existing
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent be required to expend, in the
aggregate, an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for the existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policy of the Company (the “Insurance Amount”), and if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 5.7(b) for an
amount equal to or less than the Insurance Amount, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as may be available for the Insurance Amount.
(c) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent required, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.
(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 5.7 shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware law or any other applicable Law or pursuant to any employment
agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof.
(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims
under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or
other employees including the Indemnified Parties; it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.7 is not prior to
or in substitution of any such claims under such policies.
(f) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall not permit any amendments to, and the Company shall not adopt any amendments to,
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries that would adversely affect any right of any
Indemnified Party with respect to elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses
under the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect as of the date hereof.
(g) The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and are intended to be, following the Effective Time, for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and personal representatives.
5.8. Publicity. Except with respect to any Change of Recommendation or any other action taken by the Company or the Company Board (or duly
constituted committee of the Company Board) pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.4, so long as this Agreement is in effect, each of Parent and
the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or public statement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however, that a party may, without obtaining the prior consent of the
other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statement as may
upon the advice of outside counsel be required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Without limiting the preceding sentence,
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management
available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and as reasonably requested by the other party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company may make such disclosures and communications via presentations, publicly available conference calls and other forums (a)
in response to inquiries from the press
A-47
Table of Contents
or analysts or (b) to employees, customers, suppliers and investors, in each case to the extent such communications are consistent in substance with
previous public communications that have been reviewed and previously approved by both the Company and Parent; provided that the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts under the circumstances to consult in good faith with Parent prior to making any such disclosures or communications.
5.9. Anti-takeover Laws. If any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
5.10. Stockholder Litigation. Prior to the Effective Time, in the event that any litigation or other Claim of any stockholder related to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is initiated, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and/or the members of the Company Board (or of any equivalent governing body of any Subsidiary of the Company) prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent on a regular basis of any such litigation or other Claim and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall consult with Parent with respect to, and shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate, at Parent’s expense, in the defense or settlement of, any such litigation or Claims, and no such settlement or compromise shall
be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
5.11. NASDAQ Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and the
rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Company of Common Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Common
Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. The Surviving Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Common Stock to no longer be quoted on the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.
5.12. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary, including adopting resolutions, to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Prior to taking the actions required by this
Section 5.12, the Company will provide Parent copies of any resolutions or other documentation with respect to such actions and the Company shall give
good faith consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent.
5.13. Financing.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, without the consent of the Company each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letters prior
to the Effective Time if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the
aggregate net amount of the Financing below the Required Financing Amount, including by changing the amount of the fees to be paid or the original
issue discount of the Debt Financing; (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt
of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay or prevent the Closing of the Merger or (2) make the timely funding
of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
A-48
Table of Contents
Financing, less likely to occur in any material respect; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights

discovery of) (A) of any breach (or threatened breach), default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any breach or default), cancellation, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any oral or written notice or communication from any Lender Related
Party with respect to any (1) actual or threatened breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation (or notice or communications from lenders or
other sources of Debt Financing to Parent or Merger Sub of any such actual or threatened breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation
received by Parent or Merger Sub) by any party to the Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letters or such definitive agreements; or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letters or
any definitive agreements related to the Financing that Parent believes in good faith would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the timely completion
of the Financing; and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as promptly
as reasonably practical after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required
to furnish such information if Parent in good faith reasonably believes that doing so would reasonably be expected to (a) result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege or rights under the attorney work product doctrine, (b) breach or violate any applicable Law or Legal Requirement or (c) violate any
confidentiality obligation with respect to such information.
(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable (other than as a result of a breach by the Company of this Agreement), on the terms and
conditions (including any “flex” and “securities demand” provisions in any Fee Letter) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and related Fee
Letter, Parent will promptly notify the Company in writing (but in any event within two (2) Business Days after obtaining knowledge of the occurrence or
discovery thereof) and Parent and Merger Sub will use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event, (i) arrange and obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from the same or alternative sources (A) on
terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and
related Fee Letter and (B) containing conditions to draw at Closing that would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability thereof that
(1) are not more onerous than those conditions and terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and related Fee Letter, (2) would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing or make the Closing materially less likely to occur, and (3) in an amount at least equal to the Debt
Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, but in no event more than the Required Financing Amount if such amount is less, as the case may be (the
“Alternate Debt Financing”); and (ii) obtain one or more new debt financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the “New
Debt Commitment Letters”), which new letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole or in part; provided that in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to (A) seek cash equity from any source other than those counterparty to the
Equity Commitment Letter, or in any amount with respect to a Guarantor in excess of such Guarantor’s commitment, (B) pay any fees in excess of those
contemplated by the Commitment Letters, or (C) agree to economic terms of the Alternate Debt Financing (including any “flex” provisions relating
thereto) that are less favorable in the aggregate than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any related Fee Letter (after giving effect to
any “flex” provisions therein). Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letter (and any fee letter in connection therewith or
other agreements related thereto (with customary redactions)) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any
reference in this Agreement to the “Commitment Letters” or the “Debt Commitment Letter” will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the
extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect; and
(B) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing” or the “Debt Financing” means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guarantee result in (x) the aggregate amount of committed Equity Financing of Parent being reduced from the
amounts in the Equity Commitment Letter or (y) the aggregate amount of Guaranteed Obligations (as defined in the Limited Guarantee) being reduced
from the amounts set forth in the Limited Guarantee). To the extent that the terms of the proposed equity investment by any Permitted Co-Investor would
(i) result in any Approval from any Governmental Entity

being required in order for the Closing to occur, the receipt of which is not already a condition to Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement (a “New
Approval”) or (ii) require any Permitted Co-Investor, its affiliates or their respective Representatives to cooperate in connection with obtaining any
Approval or New Approval then, in each case, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall negotiate in good faith amendments to Section 5.5 and Article
VI of this Agreement related thereto to add such New Approvals and provide for such cooperation. The Company acknowledges and agrees that adding
or seeking to add any Permitted Co-Investor as an Equity Financing source in accordance with the foregoing, or any failure of any Approval or New
Approval to be obtained in connection therewith, shall not: constitute a failure of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s representations and warranties in this
Agreement to be accurate; constitute a breach of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s covenants or failure to perform its obligations in this Agreement (including
those in Section 5.5 and Section 5.13); be deemed to prevent, impair or delay the Closing, to constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or be or deemed

enforcement and collection costs) in excess of $30 million in the event the Closing does not occur. Subject to the foregoing, (i) Parent acknowledges and
agrees that any Permitted Co-Investor’s participation as an Equity Financing source shall not be a condition to Parent or Merger Sub performing their
obligations under this Agreement and (ii) the Company retains its rights under Section 7.2(c)(i) if the condition set forth in Section 6.2(c) has not been
satisfied or waived prior to the End Date (as may be extended under Section 7.1(c)).

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;
(b) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, if (i) any Governmental Entity which must grant a Required Money Transfer
Approval has denied such approval and such denial has become final and non-appealable or (ii) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final non-appealable Order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) shall not be available to any party if issuance of such final non-
appealable Order is primarily due to the failure of such party to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein in all
material respects as required and as set forth in this Agreement;
(c) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before February 14, 2023 (as
such date may be extended pursuant to the following provisos, the “End Date”); provided, that if any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(c) have
not been satisfied or waived by the party having the benefit of the condition as of February 14, 2023 (the “Initial End Date”) (but all other conditions to
the Closing set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions)), then either the Company or Parent may extend the End Date to May 14, 2023 (the “Extended
End Date”) by delivery of written notice of such extension to the other party on or prior to the Initial End Date, in which case, subject to the second
further proviso below regarding the Marketing Period, the End Date shall be deemed for all purposes to have been extended to the Extended End Date;
provided, further, that the right to terminate this
A-57
Table of Contents
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to (i) the Company if the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date is primarily
due to the failure of the Company to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of the Company in all material respects as required and as set
forth in this Agreement or (ii) Parent, if the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date is primarily due to the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such parties in all material respects as required and as set forth in this Agreement; provided, further,
however, that if (1) as of the Initial End Date all conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived by the party having
the benefit of the condition (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being
capable of being satisfied as of the Initial End Date and at all times through the end of the Marketing Period) and the Marketing Period has not yet ended,
the End Date shall automatically be extended solely for purposes of permitting the Marketing Period to be completed to the third (3rd) Business Day
following the final day of the Marketing Period (but for the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the End Date be extended pursuant to this
clause (1) past April 26, 2023) or (2) as of the Extended End Date all conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived by
the party having the benefit of the condition (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such
conditions being capable of being satisfied as of such extended End Date and at all times through the end of the Marketing Period) and the Marketing
Period has not yet ended, the End Date shall automatically be extended solely for purposes of permitting the Marketing Period to be completed to the
third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period (but for the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the End Date be
extended pursuant to this clause (2) past June 8, 2023); provided further that Parent shall have the right but not an obligation, which right may be
exercised in its sole and absolute discretion, to waive, at the Extended End Date, the failure of the conditions in Section 6.2(c) to be satisfied as of such
Extended End Date, solely to permit the Marketing Period to occur and be completed prior to June 8, 2023) (it being agreed that any such waiver shall not
affect the Company’s right to obtain the Parent Termination fee pursuant to Section 7.2(c)(i) at or after June 8, 2023) if the Closing does not occur after
such waiver as a result of the failure to the conditions in Section 6.2(c) to be satisfied as of June 8, 2023);
(d) by either Parent or the Company (provided, that the terminating party (and, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), by written notice to the other party, if the other party (or, in the case of Parent,
Merger Sub) shall have breached (i) any of the covenants or agreements made by such other party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) herein or (ii)
any of the representations or warranties made by such other party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) herein, and in either case, such breach (a) is not
cured within forty-five (45) days following written notice to the party committing such breach (or the End Date (as may be extended under Section 7.1(c)),
if earlier), or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured and (b) would entitle the non-breaching party not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby under Article VI hereof;
(e) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof);
(f) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, if (i) the Company Board shall have effected a Change
of Recommendation, whether or not permitted under this Agreement, (ii) the Company shall have breached Section 5.3 by failing to call and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting as provided therein or the Company shall have committed a Willful and Material Breach of Section 5.4, (iii) the Company
shall have failed to publicly recommend against any tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes a Company Acquisition Proposal (including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company’s stockholders) within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (iv) to the

7.1(h) (Company Superior Proposal) then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee prior to or concurrent

Table of Contents
case of (a)(ii), a Company Acquisition Proposal, whether or not conditional, shall have been publicly announced or otherwise publicly
communicated and not withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (c) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries enters into an agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal whether or not with a person that made a
Company Acquisition Proposal prior to the date of such termination and such Company Acquisition Proposal is ultimately consummated (whether
or not within twelve (12) months of such termination of this Agreement), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or its
designee on the date of such consummation, provided, however, that solely for the purpose of this clause (ii), all references in the definition of

Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(e) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are integral parts of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties agree that the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but are liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In the
event that a party is required to commence litigation as set forth in Section 8.11 to seek all or a portion of the amounts payable to such party under this
Section 7.2, and such party prevails in the litigation, it shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all amounts that it is otherwise entitled to receive under
this Section 7.2, all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys’ fees and collection costs) which it has incurred in enforcing
its rights hereunder, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date the payment was actually received, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,300,000
(collectively, the “Expense and Interest Payments”); provided that the aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub (or the Guarantors under the Limited
Guarantee) pursuant to all provisions of this Section 7.2 and Section 5.14 shall not exceed $68,800,000 in the aggregate (the “Parent Liability Limitation”).
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any party breaches this Agreement or fails to perform any of its covenants, obligations
or agreements hereunder (whether such breach or failure is a Willful and Material Breach, unintentional or otherwise), the sole and exclusive remedies
(whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the non-breaching party or parties (or any person
A-60

claiming by or through them or with their support) against the Company Related Parties, Parent Related Parties or the Lender Related Parties, as the case
may be, for any losses, damages, costs, expenses, obligations or liabilities arising out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement contained in this Agreement), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any
failure of such transactions to be consummated), the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter and the financings contemplated therein (or
any failure of such financings to be consummated), or the failure of any such transactions to be consummated shall be:
(i) the right prior to the termination of this Agreement to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with the
terms and subject to the limitations of Section 8.12;
(ii) the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 and (A) receive the Parent Termination Fee in the circumstances
under which such fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.2(c) (and, if applicable, any Expense and Interest Payments) or (B) in any circumstance in
which the Parent Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to Section 7.2(c), seek money damages from Parent in the event of Parent’s or Merger
Sub’s Willful and Material Breach of any of their representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement or
fraud; provided, however, that in the circumstances described in this clause (B), in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub have any monetary liability
or obligations in excess of an amount equal to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (and, if applicable, any Expense and Interest Payments);
and
(iii) Parent’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 and (A) receive the Company Termination Fee in the circumstances
under which such fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.2(b) (and, if applicable, any Expense and Interest Payments) or (B) in any circumstance
under which the Company Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to Section 7.2(b), seek money damages from the Company in the event of the
Company’s Willful and Material Breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement
or fraud.
(g) While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.12 to the extent permitted
thereunder prior to the termination of this Agreement and in the alternative the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee in
lieu of specific performance, as applicable, under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the Closing occurring and the Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee, as applicable.
(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company (and the Company shall cause the Company Related Parties to not) seek,
directly or indirectly, to recover against any Parent Related Parties or Lender Related Parties, or compel payment by any Parent Related Parties or Lender
Related Parties of, any damages or other payments whatsoever or bring or maintain against any Parent Related Parties or Lender Related Parties any
actions or other Claims (whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise), in each case in this clause arising out of or
related to this Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or any failure of such transactions to be consummated), the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter
and the financings contemplated therein (or any failure of such financings to be consummated), or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter; provided, that, the foregoing shall not
restrict Claims that the Company may assert: (i) against each of Parent and Merger Sub under, and solely pursuant to the terms and limitations of, this
Agreement and (ii) against any Guarantor under the Limited Guarantee in accordance with and subject to its terms and limitations, and (iii) against any
Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with and subject to its terms and limitations pursuant to an order of specific performance
pursuant to Section 8.12(b).

8.12. Specific Performance.
(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that irreparable harm would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms and that money damages and other legal remedies, even if available, would be an inadequate remedy for such
harm. It is accordingly agreed, subject to Section 8.12(b), that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable
relief prior to a valid and effective termination of this Agreement to prevent or remedy breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any court identified in Section 8.11(a), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court having jurisdiction related to this Agreement as provided in Section 8.11(a), may seek
such an injunction without the necessity of demonstrating damages (or the inadequacy of damages and other legal remedies) or posting a bond or other
security in connection with any such injunction or other equitable relief. Subject to Section 8.12(b), each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability prior to a valid and effective termination of this Agreement
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent, restrain or remedy breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, under this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary including Section 8.12(a), it is acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek
and obtain specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger only
in the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 shall have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, so long as each of such conditions would have been satisfied
on the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 (taking into account the Marketing Period)) on the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 1.2; (ii) since such date, no event shall have occurred nor shall any condition exist that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 to fail to be satisfied on any day after such date, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to complete the Closing
in accordance with Section 1.2 and either of them have failed to do so within three (3) Business Days after the date the Closing was required to occur
pursuant to Section 1.2, (iv) the Debt Financing (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any Alternate Debt Financing that is being used in
accordance with Section 5.13(d)) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters subject only to
the Equity Financing being funded at the Closing and (v) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent that, if specific
performance is granted, the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded and Parent and Merger Sub otherwise comply with their obligations
hereunder, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
successors or permitted assigns be entitled to (w) receive both the Parent Termination Fee (or any monetary damages in lieu thereof) and an order of
specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger, (x) enforce or
A-76
Table of Contents
seek to enforce specifically the remedy of specific performance of the Debt Commitment Letter against any Lender Related Party, (y) be entitled to
specifically enforce (or to bring any Claim in equity seeking to specifically enforce) Parent’s rights under the Equity Commitment Letter to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate Closing other than as expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, or (z) seek to
specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement or to obtain an injunction or injunctions, or to bring any other Claim in equity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, against any person other than against Parent and, in such case and solely with respect to the Claims
described in this clause (z), only under the circumstances expressly set forth in Section 8.12(a) and this Section 8.12(b).
8.13. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid, illegal or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions
of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties. Notwithstanding
anything else in this Section 8.13, in no event will this Agreement be enforced without giving effect to Section 5.18, Section 7.2 (including the Parent
Liability Limitation), Section 8.12(b) and Section 8.15.
8.14. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party, except that (a) Parent and Merger Sub will have
the right to assign all or any portion of their respective rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time to any Lender
pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt
Financing, it being understood that, in each case, such assignment will not affect the obligations of the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter or the
Guarantors pursuant to the Limited Guarantee and (b) Parent and Merger Sub may assign (in whole but not in part) its rights and obligations hereunder to
any wholly owned affiliate or Subsidiary of Parent after providing written notice thereof to the Company at least five (5) Business Days in advance
thereof; provided, however, that no such assignment would reasonably be expected to (x) cause any of the conditions set forth in Article VI not to be
satisfied or to be materially delayed in being satisfied, (y) result in a material breach of any of covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or (z)
materially and adversely affect the rights of the Company hereunder; provided, further, however, that no such assignment shall relieve any party of any
obligation or liability under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
8.15. Non-Recourse. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may only be brought against persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only (x) with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein and (y) by the persons that are party to or are
expressly identified as third party beneficiaries under Section 8.9, but solely with respect to the matters set forth therein. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Transaction Documents to the contrary, the Company
covenants, agrees and acknowledges that (a) no former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates or Representatives (including any Parent Related Party or Lender Related Party), in each case, that is not a party hereto, shall have
any liability hereunder or obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub under this Agreement or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach, termination or
A-77
Table of Contents
failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing
the corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto, and (b) no recourse under this Agreement, any related document or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any related document shall be had against any Parent Related Party and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries or any person acting on its or their behalf shall assert a claim or institute a Claim that is not a Retained Claim (as defined in the
Limited Guarantee). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.15 does not limit or affect any rights or remedies that Parent or Merger Sub may have
against the parties to the Commitment Letters and does not limit or affect any rights or remedies that the Company may have against (i) the Guarantors
under the Limited Guarantee or (ii) the Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letter.

We understand that MoneyGram International, Inc. (“MoneyGram”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), among

which, among other things, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement) Merger Sub will merge with and into MoneyGram (the “Merger”), with
MoneyGram continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger, and each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
MoneyGram (“MoneyGram Common Stock”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash,
without interest (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of MoneyGram Common Stock of the Consideration to be
received by such holders in the Merger.
In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:

reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to MoneyGram;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of MoneyGram
furnished to or discussed with us by the management of MoneyGram, including certain financial forecasts relating to MoneyGram prepared

(iii)

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other
information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the
management of MoneyGram that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in
any material respect. With respect to the MoneyGram Forecasts, we have been advised by MoneyGram, and have assumed, that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of MoneyGram as to the
future financial performance of MoneyGram. We have not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of MoneyGram, nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of MoneyGram. We have not evaluated
the solvency or fair value of MoneyGram or Parent under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have
assumed, at the direction of MoneyGram, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment
of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents,
releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications,
will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on MoneyGram or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. We also have assumed, at the direction of
MoneyGram, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by us.
We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other than the Consideration to the extent expressly
specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Consideration to be received by holders of MoneyGram Common Stock and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration
received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or
view is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the
officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion
or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to MoneyGram or in
which MoneyGram might engage or as to the underlying business decision of MoneyGram to proceed with or effect the Merger. We are not expressing
any opinion with respect to, and have relied, with your consent, upon the assessments of representatives of MoneyGram regarding, legal, regulatory,
accounting, tax and similar matters relating to MoneyGram or the Merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof), as to which we understand that
MoneyGram obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to how
any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter.
We have acted as financial advisor to MoneyGram in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which is payable
upon delivery of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, MoneyGram has agreed to
reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
We and our affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign
exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment

the Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of MoneyGram Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,
