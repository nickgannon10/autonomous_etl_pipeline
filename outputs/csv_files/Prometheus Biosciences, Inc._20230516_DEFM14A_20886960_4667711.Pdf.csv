"Prometheus Biosciences, Inc._20230516_DEFM14A_20886960_4667711.Pdf",QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting (together with any
adjournments or postponements thereof, the “Special Meeting”), the Merger Agreement (as defined below) and the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub (as defined below) will be merged with and into Prometheus (as defined below), with
Prometheus surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck (as defined below) (the “Merger”). Please refer to the “Summary” beginning on
page 13 of this proxy statement and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy
statement and the documents incorporated by reference or referred to in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully and in their entirety.
Except as otherwise specifically noted in this proxy statement or as context otherwise requires, “Prometheus,” “we,” “our,” “us,” the
“Company” and similar words in this proxy statement refer to Prometheus Biosciences, Inc. Throughout this proxy statement we refer to Merck &
Co., Inc. as “Merck” and Splash Merger Sub, Inc. as “Merger Sub.” In addition, throughout this proxy statement we refer to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2023, as it may be amended from time to time, by and among Merck, Merger Sub and Prometheus, as the
“Merger Agreement.”
 
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
 
A:
On April 15, 2023, Prometheus entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Merck, with and into Prometheus, with Prometheus surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck. The board of directors of
Prometheus (the “Board”) is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of
Prometheus common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Company Shares”), in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at
the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
What is the proposed transaction?
 
A:
The proposed transaction is the acquisition of Prometheus by Merck pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement (the “Merger Proposal”) is approved by the holders of a majority of the Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote thereon as of the Record Date (as defined below) and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Prometheus, with Prometheus surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.
As a result of the Merger, Company Shares will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market
(“Nasdaq”). In addition, Company Shares will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
and Prometheus will no longer file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?
 
A:
Upon consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive $200.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), for each
Company Share that you own as of the Effective Time (as defined below), unless you have properly exercised and not failed to perfect, waived,
withdrawn or otherwise lost your right to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the “DGCL”). For example, if you own 100 Company Shares as of the Effective Time, you will receive $20,000.00 in cash in exchange for your
Company Shares (less any applicable withholding taxes). You will not be entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Merck as
a result of the Merger.
 
1Table of Contents
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Company Shares prior to the public announcement that Prometheus
entered into the Merger Agreement? How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Company Shares as of a recent
trading date?
 
A:
The Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 75% over the closing price of the Company Shares on Nasdaq of $114.01 on
April 14, 2023, the last trading day before the public announcement that Prometheus entered into the Merger Agreement. On May 15, 2023, the
last practicable day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of the Company Shares on Nasdaq was $194.43 per share. You
are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for Company Shares.
 
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
 
A:
The Special Meeting will take place virtually via live webcast on June 15, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof. There will not be a physical meeting location. Prometheus stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the
Special Meeting by visiting www.proxydocs.com/RXDX. To attend the Special Meeting, you must pre-register at www.proxydocs.com/RXDX
by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 
•
The Merger Proposal;
 
•
To approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to Prometheus’ named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger (the “Merger Compensation Proposal”); and
 
•
To approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes in person or by proxy to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment
Proposal”).
 
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
Only holders of record of Company Shares as of the close of business on May 15, 2023 (the “Record Date”) will be entitled to notice of, and to
vote at, the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 47,813,238 Company Shares issued and outstanding.
Each issued and outstanding Company Share on that date will entitle its holder to one vote, in person or by proxy, on all matters to be voted
on at the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement?
 
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon as of the Record
Date is required to approve the Merger Proposal.
The failure to grant a proxy to vote your Company Shares by submitting a signed proxy card, granting a proxy electronically over the Internet
or by telephone or to vote at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. If you hold your
Company Shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares on the
Merger Proposal will result in a broker non-vote and will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. Abstentions by you
or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.

Q:
What factors did the Board consider in deciding to enter into the Merger Agreement and recommending the approval of the Merger
Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?
 
A:
In reaching its decision to unanimously approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, and to recommend that our stockholders approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, as well as other alternatives. For a more detailed
description of these factors, see “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 46 of this
proxy statement.
 
Q:
What is a quorum and how many Company Shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
 
A:
A quorum of stockholders is the presence of stockholders holding the minimum number of shares necessary to transact business at the
Special Meeting. The holders of a majority of the voting power of Company Shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, either present in
person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present, then under our amended and
restated bylaws, either (i) a majority in voting power of the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, present at the Special Meeting
in person or represented by proxy, or (ii) the chairperson of the Special Meeting, may each adjourn the meeting, and the meeting may be held
as adjourned without further notice other than an announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken of the time, place, if any,
thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person
and vote at such adjourned meeting.
If you submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or vote at the Special Meeting (regardless of
whether you indicate how you wish to vote), your Company Shares will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If
you hold your Company Shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company
Shares will result in a broker non-vote and such Company Shares will not be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
However, if you hold Company Shares in “street name” and give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at
least one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those Company Shares will be deemed
present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any
proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank,
broker or other nominee will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
 
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to Prometheus’
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?
 
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively (excluding abstentions) at the
Special Meeting by the holders entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Merger Compensation Proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote
at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. If you hold your Company Shares in “street name,” the
failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have
any effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or
 
3
Table of Contents
other nominee are not considered to be votes cast and will have no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal.  
Because the vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Prometheus or Merck. Accordingly, if
the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable
thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Prometheus’ stockholders on the Merger Compensation Proposal.
 
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit
additional proxies?
 
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively (excluding abstentions) at the
Special Meeting by the holders entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote
at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your Company Shares in “street name,” the failure to
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have any effect
on the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee are not considered to be votes cast and will have no
effect on the Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
 
A:
The Board, after considering the various factors described under “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger”
beginning on page 46 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Prometheus and its stockholders and declared it advisable for
Prometheus to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution and delivery by Prometheus of the Merger
Agreement, the performance by Prometheus of its covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated thereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, (iii) directed that the adoption of the
Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Prometheus’ stockholders and (iv) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Prometheus’ stockholders.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Merger Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
What do I need to do now?
 
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, and the documents we
incorporate by reference and refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you, and then sign, date and
return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically on the Internet
or by telephone, so that your Company Shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your Company Shares in “street name,” please
refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your Company Shares. Please do not send your
stock certificates with your proxy card.

Table of Contents
Q:
How do I vote?
 
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your Company Shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. (“Computershare”)), there are four ways to cause your Company Shares to be voted at the Special Meeting:
 
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card and granting your proxy;
 
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card and granting your proxy;
 
•
by completing, dating, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope; or
 
•
by voting virtually at the Special Meeting; to vote your shares at the Special Meeting, you must pre-register at
www.proxydocs.com/RXDX by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting. Company Shares held
directly in your name as a stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website, provided you
have pre-registered for the Special Meeting. Company Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special
Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee, and provided you have pre-registered for the
Special Meeting.
If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted “FOR” each of the Merger
Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to grant a proxy to vote your Company Shares,
and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for granting a proxy to vote your Company Shares, if you grant a proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be
responsible. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are strongly encouraged to grant a proxy to vote your Company Shares.
If your Company Shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your
broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your Company Shares. Without those
instructions, your Company Shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
 
Q:
What is the difference between holding Company Shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 
A:
If your Company Shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those
Company Shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by
or on behalf of Prometheus.
If your Company Shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of such Company Shares
and are considered to hold them in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other
nominee who is considered, with respect to those Company Shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the
right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to
attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your Company Shares at the Special
Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Table of Contents
Q:
Will my Company Shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with Company Shares
I hold as the stockholder of record?
 
A:
No. Because any Company Shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any Company
Shares you hold as the stockholder of record, any Company Shares held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with the
Company Shares you hold as the stockholder of record. Similarly, if you own Company Shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with
your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those
Company Shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Company Shares held by a corporation or business entity must
be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Company Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules
governing the account.
 
Q:
If I hold my Company Shares in “street name,” will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my Company Shares for me on the proposals to
be considered at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
Not without your direction. Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your Company Shares on any “non-routine”
proposal if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other
nominees have the discretion to vote your Company Shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on
how to vote your Company Shares with respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and banks,
brokers and other nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you instruct
your bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your Company Shares.
You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to instruct them, as applicable, to vote your Company
Shares. Without such instructions, a broker non-vote will result, and your Company Shares will not be voted at the Special Meeting. A broker
non-vote will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
 
Q:
What happens if I do not vote?
 
A:
The required vote to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of Company Shares issued and outstanding as of the close of
business on the Record Date, not just the Company Shares that are voted at the Special Meeting. If you do not vote in person or by proxy, it
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
 
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise submitted my vote by proxy?
 
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time by:
 
•
delivering a written notice of revocation of your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at Prometheus Biosciences, Inc., Attention: Corporate
Secretary, 3050 Science Park Road, San Diego, CA 92121 prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special
Meeting;
 
•
signing a new proxy card with a date later than the date of the previously submitted proxy card relating to the same Company Shares
and returning it to us by mail prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting;
 
•
submitting a new proxy by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting;
 
•
submitting a new proxy by Internet prior to the start of the Special Meeting; or

Table of Contents
•
attending the Special Meeting and voting thereat (simply attending the Special Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked).
Please note that if you hold your Company Shares in “street name,” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your
Company Shares, the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you should contact your bank,
broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change or revoke your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the
Special Meeting website, provided you have pre-registered for the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
What is a proxy?
 
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person (a “proxy”) to vote your Company Shares. This written document describing the matters
to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your
Company Shares is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated each of Mark C. McKenna, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief
Executive Officer, and Timothy K. Andrews, General Counsel, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the Company Shares voted?
 
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant a proxy to vote your Company Shares, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or
your proxies, will vote your Company Shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy
card, you may specify whether your Company Shares should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST” or to abstain from voting on all, some or none
of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your Company Shares should be voted on a matter, the Company
Shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal, (ii) “FOR” the Merger Compensation Proposal
and (iii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
 
A:
All stockholders of Prometheus as of the Record Date may attend and vote at the virtual Special Meeting. You will not be able to attend the
Special Meeting physically in person. To vote your Company Shares at the Special Meeting, you must pre-register for the Special Meeting at
www.proxydocs.com/RXDX by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting. For additional information on
how to pre-register for the Special Meeting, please see the section entitled “The Special Meeting—Pre-Registering for the Special Meeting”
beginning on page 28 of this proxy statement.
Company Shares held directly in your name as a stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website,
provided you have pre-registered for the Special Meeting. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special
Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee and provided you have pre-registered for the Special
Meeting.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy or grant a proxy
electronically over the Internet or via telephone to ensure that your Company Shares will be represented at the Special Meeting. If you hold
your Company Shares in “street name,” because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your Company Shares at the Special
Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Table of Contents
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my Company Shares before consummation of the Merger?
 
A:
If you sell or transfer your Company Shares before consummation of the Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the Merger
Consideration in the Merger. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your Company Shares through consummation of the
Merger.
The Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the date the Merger is anticipated to be consummated.
Accordingly, if you sell or transfer your Company Shares after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements
(such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your Company Shares and each of
you notifies Prometheus in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger
is consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your Company Shares, but you will have retained your right to vote these
Company Shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your Company Shares after the Record Date, we encourage
you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or grant a proxy via the Internet or telephone. 
 
Q:
How will I receive the Merger Consideration to which I am entitled?
 
A:
If you hold your Company Shares in certificated form, you will receive a letter of transmittal shortly after the Merger is consummated
instructing you how to surrender your stock certificates, to an exchange agent to be designated by Merck in order to receive the Merger
Consideration to which you are entitled. Please do not send in your stock certificates now. If you hold your Company Shares in book-entry
form but not through the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), you will receive instructions regarding delivery of an “agent’s message” with
respect to such book-entry shares. If your Company Shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive
instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name”
Company Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
 
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now or other evidence of ownership now?
 
A:
No. Please do not send in your stock certificates or other documents evidencing ownership of Company Shares now or with your proxy card.
 
Q:
I do not know where my stock certificate is. How will I get the Merger Consideration for my Company Shares?
 
A:
If the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the consummation of the Merger will include the procedures that
you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your
stock certificate. You may also be required to post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.
 
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be consummated?
 
A:
Consummation of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, adoption of the Merger Agreement and
approval of the Merger by the holders of a majority of the Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon as of the
Record Date, the expiration or termination of the required waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), and certain other conditions.
 
8
Table of Contents
We currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the third quarter of 2023, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to the Merger. However, it is possible, including as a result of factors outside the control of Prometheus and Merck, that the Merger
will be consummated at a later time or not at all.
 
Q:
What effects will the Merger have on Prometheus?
 
A:
The Company Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act, and are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “RXDX.” As a result of the
Merger, Prometheus will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the consummation of the Merger, the Company Shares will cease trading on and be delisted from Nasdaq and will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Prometheus will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC.
 
Q:
Why am I being asked to vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal?
 
A:
In accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing you with the opportunity to cast a non-
binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may be payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
 
Q:
What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Merger Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Merger
Compensation Proposal is on an advisory basis and will not be binding on Prometheus or Merck. Further, the underlying compensation plans
and agreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is
approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the
outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Prometheus’ stockholders on the Merger Compensation Proposal.
 
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
 
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares entitled to vote thereon
as of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, Prometheus stockholders will not receive any payment for
their Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, Prometheus will remain a public company, the Company Shares will
continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Merck a termination fee of $325,364,166 upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement (the “Prometheus Termination Fee”) as described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses” beginning
on page 100 of this proxy statement.
 
Q:
Do any directors or executive officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Prometheus stockholders generally?
 
A:
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive
officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of
these potential interests and considered

Table of Contents
them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted
by our stockholders. For a description of the potential interests of our directors and executive officers in the Merger, see “The Merger—
Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger” beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement.
 
Q:
Who will count the votes obtained at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
The votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting.
 
Q:
Who will solicit votes for and bear the cost and expenses of this proxy solicitation?
 
A:
We will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc., a proxy solicitation firm, to solicit proxies in
connection with the Special Meeting at a cost of approximately $20,000 plus expenses. We will also indemnify the proxy solicitor against losses
arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing
beneficial owners of Company Shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be
solicited by our directors, officers and employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax, over the Internet or other means of communication.
No additional compensation will be paid for such services.
 
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
 
A:
We intend to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days of the Special
Meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on
page 114 of this proxy statement.
 
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Prometheus stockholders of the exchange of Company Shares for cash
pursuant to the Merger?
 
A:
The exchange of the Company Shares for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A
“U.S. Holder” (as defined below under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Company
Shares” beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement) generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Company Shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A “Non-U.S. Holder” (as defined below under “The Merger—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Company Shares” beginning on page 72 of this proxy
statement) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of the Company Shares for cash in the Merger
unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. You should consult your tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of
any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or other tax laws. A more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the Merger is provided under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Company Shares”
beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement.
 
Q:
What will the holders of Prometheus equity awards receive in the Merger?
 
A:
As of the Effective Time, (i) each Prometheus stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to
 
10
Table of Contents
receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such
Prometheus stock option by (B) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration less the applicable per share exercise price of such Prometheus
stock option, less any applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld; (ii) each Prometheus restricted
stock unit (“RSU”) award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such RSU award by (y)
the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld; and (iii) each
Prometheus Company Share subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in
full and be treated the same as all other Company Shares and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any applicable
withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld.
For additional information regarding the treatment of Prometheus equity awards, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards
and the ESPP” beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.
 
Q:
What will happen to the Prometheus 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
 
A:
Except for the offering periods under Prometheus’ 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) that were in effect on April 15, 2023 (the
“Final Offering Periods”), no new offering periods under the ESPP will commence following April 15, 2023, there will be no increase in the
amount of payroll deductions or payroll contributions permitted to be made by the participants under the ESPP during the current offering
periods, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of April 15, 2023, and no individuals will
commence participation in the ESPP following April 15, 2023. If the Effective Time occurs during one or more of the Final Offering Periods, (w)
the final exercise date(s) under the ESPP will be such date as Prometheus determines in its sole discretion (which date must be no later than the
date that is five business days prior to the Effective Time), (x) each ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used
to purchase Company Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of such final exercise date, and (y) as promptly as practicable
following the purchase of Company Shares in accordance with the preceding clause (x), Prometheus will return to each participant the funds, if
any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase.
For additional information regarding the ESPP, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on page 79
of this proxy statement.
 
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for my Company Shares under the DGCL?
 
A:
Yes. As a holder of record or beneficial owner of Company Shares, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions. Under the DGCL, stockholders and beneficial owners of Company
Shares who do not vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Company Shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is consummated, but only if they comply fully with all applicable requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger
Consideration. Any stockholder or beneficial owner intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written demand
for appraisal to Prometheus before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement is taken and must not vote or otherwise submit a proxy
to vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL will
result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your
appraisal rights we encourage you to seek the advice of your own legal counsel. See “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 68
of this proxy statement.

Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if your Company Shares are held in more than one brokerage account or are registered differently, you will
receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or grant a proxy to vote via the Internet or
telephone with respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of your Company Shares are voted.
 
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
 
A:
The SEC permits us to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary
instructions have been received, but only if we provide advance notice and follow certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder
continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial
owners of Company Shares held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding Company Shares, you may have
already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require
additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your
written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

The Special Meeting (page 28)
This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the Special Meeting to
be held virtually via live webcast on June 15, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. Prometheus
stockholders will be able to virtually attend
 
13Table of Contents
and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting www.proxydocs.com/RXDX. To attend the Special Meeting, you must pre-register at
www.proxydocs.com/RXDX by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting.
Company Shares held directly in your name as a stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website,
provided you have pre-registered for the Special Meeting. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting
website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee and provided you have pre-registered for the Special Meeting.
At the Special Meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Merger
Compensation Proposal and (iii) the Adjournment Proposal.
The Merger Proposal (page 103)
You will be asked to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides, among other
things, that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into
Prometheus, with Prometheus surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck and that, at the effective time of the Merger (the
“Effective Time”) and as a result of the Merger, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Company Shares held by Prometheus, Merck, any wholly-owned subsidiary of Prometheus or of Merck, or any stockholder or beneficial owner who
has properly exercised his, her or its appraisal rights) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.
Following the Merger, the Company Shares will no longer be publicly listed and traded on Nasdaq, and existing Prometheus stockholders will
cease to have any ownership interest in Prometheus.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum (page 29)
You are entitled to receive notice and to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned Company Shares as of the close of business on the Record
Date for the Special Meeting.
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or by
proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding Company Shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, will
constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, permitting Prometheus to transact business at the Special Meeting.
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes (page 29)
Each Company Share issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Special Meeting.
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the holders of a majority of the Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote
thereon as of the Record Date to vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. A failure to vote your Company Shares or an abstention from voting for the
Merger Proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. If you hold your Company Shares in “street name,” the
failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares on the Merger Proposal will result in a broker non-vote
and will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
As of the Record Date, there were 47,813,238 Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.

Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger (page 46)
The Board, after considering the various factors more fully described under “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the
Merger” beginning on page 46 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Prometheus and its stockholders and declared it advisable for
Prometheus to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution and delivery by Prometheus of the Merger
Agreement, the performance by Prometheus of its covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger
Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Prometheus’ stockholders and (iv) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Prometheus’ stockholders. The Board unanimously recommends that
Prometheus stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. In addition, the Board unanimously recommends that Prometheus stockholders vote
“FOR” the Merger Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC (page 52)
Prometheus retained Centerview Partners LLC (“Centerview”) as financial advisor to the Board in connection with the proposed Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In connection with this engagement, the Board requested that Centerview evaluate
the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Shares (other than any Company Shares (i) held by Prometheus as treasury
stock, (ii) owned by Merck or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (iii) the
Dissenting Company Shares, together with any Company Shares held by any affiliate of Prometheus or Merck, the “Excluded Shares”) of the
Merger Consideration proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. On April 15, 2023, Centerview rendered to the Board
its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 15, 2023 that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by
Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Merger Consideration proposed to be paid to the holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion, dated April 15, 2023, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B and is
incorporated herein by reference. Centerview’s financial advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the
Board (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes of its consideration of the Merger and
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and Centerview’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as
of the date thereof, to the holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Centerview’s opinion did not address any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger and
does not constitute a recommendation to any Prometheus stockholder or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote
with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to the Merger or any other matter. In connection with Centerview’s services as the
financial advisor to the Board, Prometheus has agreed to pay Centerview an aggregate fee of $70.5 million, $2.0 million of which was payable upon
the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which Centerview advised the Board that it was prepared to render its opinion and (ii) the rendering of the
opinion and $68.5 million of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger. 
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion.

Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (page 57)
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to the Board that, as of April 15, 2023 and based upon and subject to the
factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $200.00 in cash per Company Share to be paid to the holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of
Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of Company Shares.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated April 15, 2023, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided advisory
services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Company Shares should vote
with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between Prometheus and Goldman Sachs, Prometheus has agreed
to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of approximately $70.5 million, $1 million of which became payable upon the announcement of the Merger,
and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger.
Certain Effects of the Merger on Prometheus (page 38)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Prometheus, with
Prometheus surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “surviving corporation” to refer
to Prometheus as the surviving corporation following the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of
the surviving corporation. The Effective Time will occur, if it occurs, upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (or at such later date and time as we and Merck may agree in writing and specify in such certificate of merger). Throughout this proxy
statement, we use the term “Closing Date” to refer to the date on which the closing of the Merger occurs.
Effect on Prometheus if the Merger Is Not Consummated (page 38)
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares entitled to vote thereon
as of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, Prometheus stockholders will not receive any payment for their
Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, Prometheus will remain a public company, the Company Shares will continue to be
listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified
circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Prometheus may be required to pay Merck a termination fee, as described under “The
Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses” beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement. Additionally, a reverse termination fee
may be payable by Merck to Prometheus in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, as described under
“The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses” beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be consummated, the price of
the Company Shares may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the Company Shares would return to the
price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Merger Consideration (page 39)
In the Merger, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than as described herein) will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically, without any action by the holders
 
16
Table of Contents
of such Company Shares, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and each holder of a share represented by a certificate
(“Certificates”) or non-certificated and represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Company Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As
described further under “The Merger Agreement—Payment for Company Shares” beginning on page 80 of this proxy statement, prior to the Closing
Date, Merck will deposit or cause to be deposited cash in an amount necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration with an exchange agent
designated by Merck that is reasonably acceptable to Prometheus (the “paying agent”) (which amount will not include any amounts payable to the
holders of Prometheus equity awards). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates will receive a letter of transmittal
instructing them to send their Certificates to the exchange agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration for each Company Share represented
by such Certificates.
Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by Prometheus, Merck, Merger Sub, or by
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Prometheus, Merck or Merger Sub (“Canceled Company Shares”) will automatically be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor at the Effective Time.
Further, any Company Shares that are issued and outstanding and held by Prometheus stockholders (or held in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of a beneficial owner who beneficially owns such Company Shares) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who are entitled to
demand and who shall have properly and validly demanded their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in compliance in all
respects with Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”) (collectively, “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262. See “The
Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement for more information.
After the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
you will no longer have any rights as a Prometheus stockholder as a result of the Merger (except that any holder of Dissenting Company Shares will
have those rights granted under Section 262), nor will you be entitled to receive any shares in Merck or the surviving corporation.
Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP (page 79)
Under the Merger Agreement, each Prometheus stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Prometheus stock option by (ii) an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration less the applicable per share exercise price of such Prometheus stock option.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each Prometheus RSU award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of
Company Shares underlying such Prometheus RSU award by (ii) the Merger Consideration.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each Company Share issued under Prometheus’ 2021 Incentive Award Plan or 2017 Equity Incentive
Plan that is subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Prometheus Restricted
Share”) will vest in full and be treated the same as all other Company Shares and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
All amounts that become due in respect of outstanding Prometheus equity or equity-based awards described herein will be less any required
withholding taxes and without interest.

Table of Contents
Except for the Final Offering Periods under the ESPP, no new offering periods under the ESPP will commence following April 15, 2023, there will
be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions or payroll contributions permitted to be made by the participants under the ESPP during the
current offering periods, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of April 15, 2023, and no individuals
will commence participation in the ESPP following April 15, 2023. If the Effective Time occurs during one or more of the Final Offering Periods, (w) the
final exercise date(s) under the ESPP will be such date as Prometheus determines in its sole discretion (which date must be no later than the date that
is five business days prior to the Effective Time), (x) each ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase
Company Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of such final exercise date, which shares, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, will be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and (y) as promptly as
practicable following the purchase of Company Shares in accordance with the preceding clause (x), Prometheus will return to each participant the
funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase. If the Effective Time occurs after the end of both of the Final Offering
Periods, (x) all amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the ESPP at the end of each of the Final Offering Periods shall be used to
purchase whole Company Shares under the terms of the ESPP for such offering period, which shares, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, will be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and (y) as promptly as
practicable following the purchase of Company Shares in accordance with the preceding clause (x), Prometheus will return to each participant the
funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase.
Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger (page 64)
In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, our stockholders should be aware that members of the
Board and Prometheus’ executive officers may have various interests in the Merger that may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of
Prometheus stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of these potential interests and considered them at the time they
approved the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that the Prometheus stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These
potential interests include, but may not be limited to:
 
•
each member of the Board and each of Prometheus’ executive officers holds outstanding Prometheus equity awards. All such equity
awards outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement will be afforded the treatment described above under “—Treatment of
Prometheus Equity Awards and the ESPP”;
 
•
each of Prometheus’ executive officers is party to a preexisting employment letter agreement that provides for severance payments and
benefits upon a qualifying termination, and in Mr. McKenna’s case, enhanced severance payments and benefits in connection with a
change in control (including the Merger);
 
•
if an executive officer experiences a qualifying termination prior to payment of fiscal year 2023 bonuses, the executive officer will receive
his or her 2023 bonus, paid at two-hundred percent (200%) of target (which will be prorated if such termination occurs prior to
December 31, 2023); and
 
•
continued indemnification in favor of the current and former directors and officers of Prometheus, as well as certain obligations related
to maintenance of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
For additional information on the potential interests of members of the Board and Prometheus’ executive officers in the Merger, see “The
Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger” beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement.

Table of Contents
Financing of the Merger (page 68)
The consummation of the Merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Merck. Merck and Merger Sub have represented in the
Merger Agreement that they have available or, with respect to Merger Sub, will have available as of the Effective Time, sufficient funds for the
satisfaction of all of their obligations under the Merger Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses required to be paid by Merck or Merger
Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Appraisal Rights (page 68)
If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their Company
Shares under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of
their Company Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your
Company Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are
otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of
such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their Company Shares following
petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of
their Company Shares determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights.
Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult
their legal and financial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record of Company Shares and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds or beneficially owns, as applicable, such Company
Shares through the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to the Merger in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn,
lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand
for appraisal of such Company Shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the
holder of record of the Company Shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial
ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at
which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Prometheus and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Company Shares (page 72)
The receipt of cash for Company Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt
of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s Company Shares in the Merger generally will result in such U.S. Holder’s recognition of
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted
tax basis in the Company Shares surrendered in the Merger. A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect
to the exchange of Company Shares for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. Stockholders
should refer to the discussion under “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of Company Shares”
beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement and consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the
Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or
other tax laws.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 75)
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the
HSR Act has expired or been terminated. Prometheus and Merck filed their respective HSR Act notifications on April 21, 2023. We currently do not
expect that any other clearance, approval or consent would be required under any other applicable antitrust law in connection with the Merger.
Litigation Related to the Merger (page 77)
On May 9, 2023, two lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Prometheus and the
members of the Board: O’Dell v. Prometheus Biosciences, Inc., Case No. 23-cv-3862, and Wang v. Prometheus Biosciences, Inc., Case No. 23-cv-
03875. The lawsuits allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by Prometheus on April 28, 2023 with the SEC in connection with the Merger
omits material information with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, rendering it false and misleading in violation of
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief, rescission, declaratory relief and unspecified
monetary damages. Prometheus believes these lawsuits are wholly without merit. Additional lawsuits regarding the Merger may be filed.
No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change (page 90)
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and
the Effective Time, Prometheus will not, and will cause its directors and officers not to, nor will it authorize or knowingly permit any of its other
representatives to, and will direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
 
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined and described under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and
Agreements—No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change” beginning on page 90
of this proxy statement);
 
•
furnish to any person (other than Merck, Merger Sub or any designees or representatives of Merck or Merger Sub), or any
representative thereof, any information, or afford to any person (other than Merck, Merger Sub or any designees or representatives of
Merck or Merger Sub) access to the business,
 
20
Table of Contents
properties, assets, books, records or other information, or to any personnel, of Prometheus or any of its subsidiaries, in any such case
with the intent to facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
 
•
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any person, or any representative thereof, with respect to any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (except to notify any person of
Prometheus’ obligations relating to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement);
 
•
enter into any merger agreement, purchase agreement, letter of intent or similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined and described under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and
Agreements—No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change” beginning on page 90
of this proxy statement) entered into in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement);
 
•
approve any transaction under, or any third party becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL; or
 
•
approve, authorize, agree or publicly announce any intention to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if before obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares
entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date in favor of the Merger Proposal (the “Prometheus Stockholder Approval”), Prometheus or any of its
representatives has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any person or group of persons that did not result from a material breach
of Prometheus’ obligations related to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement, then if the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined and described under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation;
Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change” beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement) and that the failure
to take action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Prometheus may, subject to certain
requirements:
 
•
enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—
No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change” beginning on page 90 of this proxy
statement), as required by the Merger Agreement, with such person or group of persons;
 
•
engage in discussions to clarify the terms and conditions of, or furnish information with respect to Prometheus to the person or group
of persons making such Acquisition Proposal; and
 
•
participate and engage in discussions or negotiations with the person or group of persons making such Acquisition Proposal regarding
such Acquisition Proposal.
Before obtaining the Prometheus Stockholder Approval, the Board, in response to (i) the receipt of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from a material breach of Prometheus’ covenants and agreements related to non-
solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement, or (ii) the occurrence of an Intervening Event (as defined and described under “The Merger
Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change”
beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement), may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (as defined under “The Merger Agreement—
Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change” beginning on
page 90 of this proxy statement) or, in the case of clause (i) above and subject to compliance with certain
 
21
Table of Contents
procedures specified in the Merger Agreement, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such applicable Acquisition Proposal and terminate
the Merger Agreement.
However, the Board is not permitted to take the actions described in the paragraph immediately above unless, among other things, (i) the
Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) in the case of receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the Board
(or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, that an Intervening Event has occurred, (iii) Prometheus provides
written notice to Merck at least three (3) business days prior to effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating the Merger
Agreement of its intent to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor, (iv) Prometheus is, and causes its representatives to be, reasonably
available to negotiate with Merck in good faith (to the extent Merck desires to negotiate) during such three business day period to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as would obviate the basis for a Company Board Recommendation Change or the
termination of the Merger Agreement, and (v) no earlier than the end of such three business day period, the Board (or a committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), after considering any amendments to the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement proposed by Merck in a binding written offer irrevocably made by Merck during such three business day
period, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law (and, in the
case of receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal). In the event of any
change to the financial terms (including any change to the amount or form of consideration payable) or other revision to the terms or conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, Prometheus must provide written notice to Merck at least two business days prior to effecting a Company Board
Recommendation Change or terminating the Merger Agreement of its intent to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor and, if requested by
Merck, negotiate with Merck in good faith (to the extent Merck desires to negotiate) during such period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement as would obviate the basis for a Company Board Recommendation Change or the termination of the Merger
Agreement.

Board Recommendation Change, approving or recommending a Superior Proposal, or terminating the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement for a Superior Proposal, see “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition
Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change” beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement.

its obligations related to non-solicitation and as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation;
Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change” beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement
and (ii) Prometheus pays to Merck the termination fee as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee;
Certain Expenses” beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement).
Termination Fee; Certain Expenses (page 100)
Under certain circumstances, including due to a change in the Company Board Recommendation and the entry by Prometheus into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, Prometheus will be required to pay Merck the Prometheus Termination Fee equal to $325,364,166. In
addition, in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including due to a failure to effect the Merger
prior to the Termination Date because of an inability to obtain the necessary competition approvals or due to the entry of a final, non-appealable
antitrust law or order permanently restraining, enjoining, preventing, or prohibiting the Merger, Merck will be required to pay Prometheus a
termination fee equal to $650,728,333 (the “Merck Termination Fee”). For more information, please see “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee;
Certain Expenses” beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement.
Generally, if Merck actually receives the termination fee in circumstances in which it is payable by Prometheus, Prometheus will have no further
liability to Merck or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement except in certain limited circumstances. Similarly, if Prometheus actually receives the
termination fee in circumstances in which it is payable by Merck, Merck will have no further liability to Prometheus under the Merger Agreement
except in certain limited circumstances.
Expenses Generally (page 101)
Except as otherwise described in this proxy statement, including under “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses”
beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement, whether or not the Merger is

the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

future.
Delisting and Deregistration of Company Shares (page 77)
If the Merger is consummated, following the Effective Time, the Company Shares will cease trading on Nasdaq and will be deregistered under
the Exchange Act. As such, we would no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2023, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to notice of and to
vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournments or postponements thereof. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be
available in our offices located at 3050 Science Park Road, San Diego, CA 92121, during regular business hours for a period of at least 10 days before the
Special Meeting.
As of the Record Date, there were 47,813,238 Company Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special Meeting.
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the presence at
the Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding Company Shares entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting will constitute a quorum for Prometheus to transact business at the Special Meeting. In general, Company Shares that were
issued and outstanding as of the Record Date and are represented by a properly signed and returned proxy card will be counted as Company Shares
present and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. Company Shares represented by proxies received but marked
“ABSTAIN” will be included in the calculation of the number of Company Shares considered to be present at the Special Meeting for purposes of
determining a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of Company Shares considered to be present at the Special
Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. However, if a beneficial owner of Company Shares held in street name gives voting instructions to the
bank, broker or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those
Company Shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting and for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as
instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal.
In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting would be adjourned to a later date to solicit
additional proxies, and a quorum will have to be established at such adjourned date.

If a Prometheus stockholder fails to vote, it will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but it will have
no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
If a Prometheus stockholder abstains from voting, it will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will
not be considered to be a vote cast on, and will have no effect on, the Merger Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
If you hold your Company Shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares
will result in a broker non-vote, and each broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on
the Merger Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

Voting at the Special Meeting
You can vote at the virtual Special Meeting, which will be held on June 15, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at www.proxypush.com/RXDX (unless
the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed).
You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by returning the proxy card in advance by mail, over
the Internet or by telephone. Although Prometheus offers four different voting methods, Prometheus encourages you to vote over the Internet or by
phone as Prometheus believes they are the most cost-effective methods. We also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning
to attend the Special Meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed.
Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy
To ensure that your Company Shares are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you submit your proxy or provide voting instructions
for your Company Shares held in “street name” to your bank, broker or other nominee promptly, even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting.
Company Shares Held by Record Holders
If you are a stockholder of record and your Company Shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you may submit
your proxy using one of the methods described below.
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting a proxy. You
can grant a proxy by telephone by calling the toll-free number 866-447-1752, until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special
Meeting, or via the Internet, until the start of the Special Meeting, by accessing the Internet address as specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your
Company Shares will be voted as you direct, and in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as described
below. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically over the
Internet or by telephone.

Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting, your Company Shares will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.
Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All Company Shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Special
Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without
indicating how you wish to vote, such Company Shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” each of the Merger Proposal,
the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record as of the close of
business on the Record Date, unless you attend the Special Meeting, your Company Shares will not be considered present at the Special Meeting for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, and your failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and
will have no effect on the vote regarding the Merger Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Company Shares Held in “Street Name”
If your Company Shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, your bank, broker or other nominee will send you
instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your Company Shares. You may cause your Company Shares to be voted through your bank,
broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or by the Internet or telephone
through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions provided to you by them if such a service is available, or by attending the
Special Meeting and voting using your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control number, by contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to
obtain a control number so that you may vote.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote your Company Shares on “routine” matters if
you fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Company Shares with respect to such matters. The Merger Proposal, the
Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal described in this proxy statement are “non-routine” matters, and your bank, broker or
other nominee therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Accordingly, if you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other
nominee’s voting form, do not provide voting instructions via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if applicable, or do
not attend the Special Meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, such actions will result in a “broker non-
vote.” Broker non-votes, if any, will not be considered present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the
Special Meeting, will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and will have no effect on the Merger Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. However, if a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in street name gives voting instructions to the
bank, broker or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but gives no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those
shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting and for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with
respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. For Company Shares held in
“street name,” only Company Shares affirmatively voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal
will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.

of revocation must be received by our Corporate Secretary prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2023, the day preceding the Special Meeting.
If you hold your Company Shares in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to
change your vote or submit new voting instructions. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting with your control number, or, if you did not
obtain a control number, by contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number. Any adjournment or postponement of the Special
Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow Prometheus stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any
time prior to their use at the Special Meeting, as adjourned or postponed.

If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their Company Shares
under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their Company
Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your Company Shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the
Merger Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262.
 
33Table of Contents
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their Company Shares following petition to, and
an appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their Company Shares
determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the
procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the
provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to
exercise such rights.
A holder of record of Company Shares and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds or beneficially owns, as applicable, such Company Shares
through the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to the Merger in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or
waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal
of such Company Shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of
the Company Shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement
that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents
to receive notices given by Prometheus and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”
beginning on page 68 of this proxy statement), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its Company Shares exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

This proxy statement, and the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement, as well as information included in oral statements or other
written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf, contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical
facts. Forward-looking statements can usually be identified by the use of terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,”
“evolve,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “looking ahead,” “project,” “may,” “might,” “opinion,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “should,” “will,”
“would” and similar words or expressions. Stockholders are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and the following
factors:
 
•
the inability to consummate the Merger within the anticipated time period, or at all, due to any reason, including the failure to obtain the
Prometheus Stockholder Approval or the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the
termination or expiration of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act;
 
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement,
including the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances requiring us to pay Merck the Prometheus Termination
Fee;
 
•
risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current plans and operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key employees;
 
•
the effect of the announcement, pendency or consummation of the Merger on our business relationships (including, without limitation,
suppliers and other business partners), operating results and business generally;
 
•
potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger that could affect
Prometheus’ financial performance;
 
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
 
•
risks related to diverting the attention of our management and employees from ongoing business operations;
 
•
the inability to obtain the Prometheus Stockholder Approval with respect to the Merger;
 
•
the risk that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not consummated;
 
•
the effect of the restrictions placed on our business activities and the limitations on our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger during
the pendency of the Merger, pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
 
•
the nature, cost and outcome of any litigation and other legal proceedings, including any such proceedings related to the Merger and
instituted against us and others;
 
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are unable to solicit other Acquisition Proposals during the pendency of the
Merger;
 
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to our stockholders that are treated as U.S. Holders for United
States federal income tax purposes;
 
•
Prometheus’ ability to implement its business strategy, including the fact that our stockholders would forego the opportunity to realize the
potential long-term value of the successful execution of our current strategy as an independent public company; and
 
36Table of Contents
•
the risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the parties to the proposed Merger.
Consequently, no forward-looking statements may be guaranteed and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments
anticipated by such forward-looking statements will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or
effects on, Prometheus or its businesses or operations. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary
materially from the forward-looking statements. The foregoing review of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ from expectations
should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with statements that are included herein and elsewhere, including the risk
factors included in Prometheus’ most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, factors and matters described or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement and other reports filed with the SEC.
Any forward-looking statement made in this proxy statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Prometheus can give no assurance
that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Prometheus undertakes no
obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be
made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If Prometheus does
update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-
looking statements.

If the Merger Agreement is adopted by Prometheus stockholders and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Prometheus, with Prometheus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Merck.
At the Effective Time, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The Company Shares are listed and trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “RXDX.” As a result of the Merger, Prometheus will cease to be a publicly
traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck. Prior to the Effective Time, we will reasonably cooperate with Merck to delist the
Company Shares from Nasdaq and deregister the Company Shares under the Exchange Act, provided that such delisting and termination will not be
effective until after the Effective Time. Upon such delisting and deregistration, we will no longer be a publicly traded company and will no longer be
required to file periodic reports with the SEC, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations. If the Merger is consummated, you
will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation or Merck.",48,48

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares entitled to vote thereon as of
the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, Prometheus stockholders will not receive any payment for their Company
Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, Prometheus will remain a public company, the Company Shares will continue to be listed and traded
on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be consummated, the price of the
Company Shares may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the Company Shares would return to the price at
which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of
your Company Shares. If the Merger is not consummated, the Board will continue to evaluate and review our business operations, assets, operating
results, financial condition, prospects and business strategy, among other things, and make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to
seek to enhance stockholder value. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares
entitled to vote thereon as of the Record Date or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other
transaction acceptable to Prometheus will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, under specified circumstances, Prometheus may be required to pay Merck a termination
fee, and under other specified circumstances, Merck may be required to pay Prometheus a termination fee, as described under “The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fee; Certain Expenses” beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement.

therefor at the Effective Time.
“Dissenting Company Shares” refers to each Company Share issued and outstanding and held by a stockholder of Prometheus as of immediately

After the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you
will no longer have any rights as a Prometheus stockholder as a result of the Merger (except that any holder of Dissenting Company Shares will have
those rights granted under Section 262), nor will you be entitled to receive any shares in Merck or the surviving corporation.
Each of the paying agent, the surviving corporation, Merger Sub, and Merck will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to the Merger Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld therefrom under applicable tax laws. If the paying agent,
the surviving corporation, Merger Sub, or Merck, as the case may be, so deducts and withholds amounts and timely and properly remits such amounts to
the applicable governmental authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

The terms of the Merger Agreement were the result of extensive negotiations between Prometheus, Merck and their respective affiliates and
representatives. The following is a brief description of the background of the Merger and related transactions.
The Board, together with members of senior management of Prometheus, regularly reviews and assesses the performance, future growth prospects,
business plans and the overall strategic direction of Prometheus, and considers a variety of strategic alternatives that may be available to Prometheus,
including continuing to pursue its strategy as a standalone company or pursuing potential strategic or financing transactions with third parties, in each
case, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value.
As part of that review, on May 19, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs, financial advisor to Prometheus, and Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham”), legal advisor to Prometheus, in attendance, during which representatives
of Goldman Sachs presented to the Board regarding the current environment of biopharmaceutical capital markets and M&A transactions and
considerations associated therewith, including the current regulatory environment, as well as potential financing windows for Prometheus.

Also in May 2022, members of Prometheus management met with representatives of Centerview to discuss market conditions, industry
transactions, and potential strategic opportunities.
On August 11, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham in
attendance, during which representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed current biopharmaceutical capital markets and M&A considerations, including
recently announced transactions, and reviewed process and timeline considerations related to strategic partnering and financing opportunities for
Prometheus. After the discussion, the Board authorized Prometheus to (i) explore potential strategic partnering and financing opportunities and (ii) taking
into account a number of factors, including its familiarity with Prometheus, its reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking firm, and its
substantial experience with respect to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, engage Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor in connection
with this review of strategic alternatives.
On September 27, 2022, Prometheus entered into an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs to explore potential strategic opportunities.
From October 2022 to early December 2022, Prometheus management, with the assistance of representatives of Goldman Sachs, identified potential
parties for a partnership with respect to PRA023, including to co-develop and co-commercialize PRA023 worldwide, and, at the direction of Prometheus
management, representatives of Goldman Sachs conducted outreach to seventeen parties, comprised of large and mid-cap pharmaceutical companies,
including Merck, Party V, Party W, Party X, Party Y and Party Z, to discuss such opportunities. All but one of the parties contacted expressed interest in
exploring a partnership with Prometheus and of those sixteen potential counterparties, each either had an existing non-disclosure agreement in place with
Prometheus from a prior business opportunity or entered into a new non-disclosure agreement in connection with this outreach. Of the sixteen non-
disclosure agreements, ten included a standstill provision, none of which included a “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision with respect thereto. Each of the
sixteen parties was given access to a virtual data room enabling them to conduct due diligence regarding Prometheus and Prometheus management gave
management presentations to each of the parties. Members of Prometheus management also responded to due diligence requests from the parties.
On November 10, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Latham in
attendance, during which Goldman Sachs presented on and discussed with the Board strategic opportunities that might become available to Prometheus
following the planned release of results of its ARTEMIS-UC Phase 2 and APOLLO-CD Phase 2a studies and in the context of the broader financial
markets.
On November 30, 2022, members of Prometheus management met with representatives of Centerview to discuss market conditions, industry
transactions, and potential strategic opportunities.
On December 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Latham in attendance, to discuss
Prometheus’ ARTEMIS-UC Phase 2 and APOLLO-CD Phase 2a study results. Members of Prometheus management presented to the Board regarding the
positive trial results and discussed the expected market reaction to the trial results announcement in the context of a potential financing. Taking into
account the positive trial results and cash runway considerations, the Board then determined it was in the best interests of Prometheus and its
stockholders to prepare for a potential equity financing, and the Board authorized the creation of a pricing committee of the Board, composed of Mark
McKenna, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at Prometheus, Joseph Papa and Martin Hendrix, both members of the Board, and delegated
to the pricing committee the authority to determine and approve the aggregate number of shares to be sold and the price per share for a common stock
equity capital raise.
On December 7, 2022, Prometheus publicly announced (i) positive top line results for PRA023 in both its ARTEMIS-UC Phase 2 study and its
APOLLO-CD Phase 2a study and its intention to advance PRA023 into
 
40
Table of Contents
Phase 3 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease indications and (ii) a proposed $250 million public offering of common stock, with Goldman Sachs,
among others, acting as joint bookrunning manager for the offering. The price of a Company Share closed at $36.06 on December 6, 2022 and $95.80 on
December 7, 2022 and opened at $103.06 on December 8, 2023.
On December 8, 2022, after approval of the pricing committee of the Board, Prometheus announced the pricing of an upsized common stock offering
for gross proceeds, after exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, of $550 million at a price of $110.00 per share. The offering closed on
December 13, 2022.
Following the announcement of positive trial results and the successful common stock offering, Prometheus management, in consultation with the
Board and separately with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview, determined to pause any near-term partnership discussions, and between
December 10, 2022 and December 11, 2022, Mr. McKenna contacted each of the previously interested parties to inform them that Prometheus was no
longer moving forward with a formal process for potential partnership opportunities and would be shutting down access to the virtual data room.
From December 2022 until late March 2023, members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview had regular
communications with a number of the previously contacted parties, including Merck, Party V, Party W, Party X, Party Y and Party Z, in order to respond to
questions and provide regular updates regarding Prometheus’ business, and members of senior Prometheus management met in person at the J.P. Morgan
Annual Healthcare Conference in January 2023 with representatives of Merck, Party V, Party W, Party X and Party Y and subsequently met with Party Z.
Throughout these meetings, representatives of Merck, Party V, Party W, Party X, Party Y and Party Z confirmed that they remained interested in a
potential strategic transaction with Prometheus but did not make any proposals with respect to a transaction. Over the course of these meetings and
upon request, interested parties had their access to the virtual data room restored, with Merck receiving access on January 12, 2023, Party W receiving
access on January 23, 2023 and Party X receiving access on March 14, 2023.
As part of the communications described in the immediately preceding paragraph, on January 19, 2023, Sunil Patel, Senior Vice President and Head
of Corporate Development & Licensing at Merck, called Mr. McKenna to express continued interest in Prometheus and requested access to certain
diligence materials which were subsequently provided by Prometheus to Merck. On February 9, 2023, Mr. Patel again spoke with Mr. McKenna and
expressed Merck’s significant interest in a potential strategic transaction between the two companies.
On March 6, 2023, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke to a representative of Party V who advised that Party V was stopping further evaluation
of a potential strategic transaction with Prometheus.
On March 7, 2023, Mr. McKenna met with a representative of Party Z, who indicated that Party Z was unlikely to move forward with a potential
acquisition of Prometheus. On the same day, members of the senior management of Prometheus met with representatives of Merck and further discussed
Merck’s interest in the transaction.
On March 27, 2023, the Board held a meeting with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Centerview and Latham in
attendance. During the meeting, representatives of Centerview gave a presentation on Centerview’s experience with M&A in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries and their view with respect to the M&A environment in general, including specific considerations for Prometheus. The Board
also discussed with its advisors potential capital raise opportunities in 2023.
On March 31, 2023, Mr. Patel and Rob Davis, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at Merck, called Mr. McKenna to inform him that
Merck would submit an offer to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares at $150.00 per share and expressed that Merck wished to move quickly
towards executing transaction documents. Later that day, Merck submitted a written non-binding indication of interest to acquire all outstanding
Company Shares at $150.00 per share in cash (the “March 31 Offer”), with a targeted signing date of April 21, 2023. During these discussions with Merck
and in connection with all other discussions
 
41
Table of Contents
with Merck and all other potential bidders, there was no discussion between representatives of Prometheus and representatives of any other party with
respect to post-closing employment or compensation for members of Prometheus management.
Later on March 31, 2023, the Board met, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham
in attendance, to review and discuss the March 31 Offer. Representatives from Latham reviewed with the Board certain legal aspects involved in a sale
transaction, including the Board’s fiduciary duties in assessing the March 31 Offer and a potential sale process. The Board, together with Prometheus
management and its financial and legal advisors discussed, among other things, (i) Prometheus’ standalone prospects, including projected capital needs
to advance its Phase 3 trials and its upcoming end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), (ii) the price proposed
by Merck in the March 31 Offer, (iii) closing certainty and regulatory considerations with respect to the March 31 Offer, (iv) other potential bidders with
the ability to consummate a transaction at or above the value of the March 31 Offer, including the closing certainty and regulatory considerations of
potentially transacting with any of Party W, Party X or Party Y, and (v) Prometheus’ response to the March 31 Offer. At the conclusion of the discussion,
taking into account the topics discussed and the advice of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview, the Board
authorized Prometheus management to reach out to Party W, Party X and Party Y to inform them that an offer to acquire Prometheus had been received
and to gauge their level of interest in submitting an offer to acquire Prometheus on an expedited timeline. The Board selected these parties because of
their prior interest in Prometheus, their perceived ability to move quickly to enter into and consummate a potential transaction based on the progress of
each of their diligence review of Prometheus, and the Board’s belief that they would be capable of making the most competitive offers due to their size
and financial capabilities. In addition, the Board discussed and ultimately determined to formally approve the engagement of Centerview as financial
advisor due to its familiarity with Prometheus, its reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking firm and its substantial experience in
transactions similar to the Merger.
Also on March 31, 2023, Mr. McKenna, at the direction of the Board, spoke to representatives of Party W, Party X, and Party Y to inform them that
an offer to acquire Prometheus had been received.
On April 2, 2023, the Board met again, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham in
attendance, to further discuss the March 31 Offer. Representatives of Prometheus management, Centerview and Goldman Sachs reviewed and discussed
with the Board Prometheus management’s preliminary Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, including the material assumptions included therein,
and then representatives of each of Centerview and Goldman Sachs presented to the Board regarding selected precedent transactions, public market
perspectives and their preliminary illustrative financial analyses. For a detailed discussion regarding the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,
please see “The Merger—Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement. Following the Board’s
consideration of the financial analyses and the preliminary Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, the Board directed management and its advisors
to continue to engage with each of Merck, Party W, Party X and Party Y and to communicate to Merck that it would need to improve its offer. Following
the meeting, Mr. McKenna reached out to Mr. Patel to inform him that Prometheus was willing to provide Merck access to additional diligence materials,
but that Merck would need to significantly increase its offer price before Prometheus would be willing to enter into a potential strategic transaction.
Later in the day on April 2, 2023, at the direction of the Board, Mr. McKenna spoke with representatives of Party X to encourage Party X to submit
an offer quickly if it was interested in pursuing a potential transaction with Prometheus.
On April 3, 2023, Prometheus executed an engagement letter with Centerview. Also on April 3, 2023, at the direction of the Board, Mr. McKenna
spoke with representatives of Party W to encourage Party W to submit an offer quickly if it was interested in pursuing a potential transaction with
Prometheus.

On April 4, 2023, Mr. McKenna spoke with representatives of Party Y regarding various diligence items, including Prometheus’ drug candidates and
the overall business potential. At this meeting, Mr. McKenna encouraged Party Y to submit an offer quickly if it was interested in pursuing a potential
transaction with Prometheus and, following the meeting, Party Y’s access to the virtual data room was restored.
On April 5, 2023, Mr. McKenna met in person with representatives of Party X who conveyed that they remained very interested in a potential
strategic transaction with Prometheus and indicated that an acquisition proposal would be submitted to Prometheus early the week of April 10.
On April 6, 2023, Mr. McKenna had calls with representatives of Party W to further discuss their interest in a potential transaction. During the call,
representatives of Party W confirmed that they intended to submit a formal offer.
Also on April 6, 2023, representatives of Prometheus management held a meeting with representatives of Party X. During the meeting,
representatives of Party X conveyed to Prometheus management that they had made significant progress on their diligence review and were focused on
submitting a formal offer.
On April 7, 2023, Prometheus received in advance of a scheduled meeting with the FDA on April 13, 2023 initial feedback from the FDA regarding
conclusions from the Phase 2 clinical trials for PRA023 and its future clinical development.
Also on April 7, 2023, representatives of Goldman Sachs had calls with representatives of Party W and Party X during which Goldman Sachs, at the
direction of the Board, expressed to the bidders that they would need to make competitive offers quickly and highlighted that Prometheus was focused
on all aspects of an offer, including price and the level of closing certainty, including with respect to required regulatory approvals. Following these
conversations, Party X confirmed that they intended to make an offer.
From April 6, 2023 through April 14, 2023, at Merck’s and Party X’s request, members of Prometheus management held numerous diligence calls
with representatives of Merck and Party X on topics including intellectual property, tax, clinical results and feedback, human resources, license
agreements, finance and accounting, commercial launch and legal due diligence.
On April 8, 2023, Mr. McKenna spoke with representatives of Party W during which they confirmed that they intended to submit an offer on April
12, 2023 and requested in-person meetings on April 13 and April 14, 2023.
On April 10, 2023, Mr. McKenna spoke with representatives of Party W, Party X and Party Y to further discuss their interest in a potential
transaction, to respond to certain diligence questions and to encourage each of them to make a bid expeditiously.
Also on April 10, 2023, the Board met, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham in
attendance, to discuss the status of discussions with Merck, Party W, Party X and Party Y, including the indication from Party X that they would not be
able to submit an offer without obtaining approval from their board of directors and the lack of indication that Party Y was likely to make a bid. During the
meeting, representatives of Latham again discussed with the Board their fiduciary obligations in connection with considering and approving a sale
transaction. Following discussion on these topics, the Board reviewed the financial advisor relationships disclosure of each of Centerview and Goldman
Sachs with respect to each of Merck, Party W and Party X. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Board authorized Prometheus management and the
financial advisors to continue discussions with each party and directed them to seek the highest potential value for Prometheus stockholders.
On April 12, 2023, Party W submitted a non-binding letter of interest to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares for $167.50 per share, in
cash (the “April 12 Offer”), and requested to meet in person with Prometheus management to discuss the terms of the April 12 Offer and a potential
transaction.

Table of Contents
On April 13 and 14, 2023, representatives of Prometheus management provided an initial draft of the Merger Agreement for review to each of
Merck, Party W and Party X, which initial draft, among other things, (1) included seller-friendly provisions with respect to representations, warranties and
covenants, (2) proposed a “hell or high water” standard for regulatory efforts with no reverse termination fee, (3) proposed a termination fee of 2.0% of
the enterprise value of the potential transaction and (4) did not propose an outside date for a potential transaction.
On April 13, 2023, members of Prometheus management attended an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the results and conclusions
of the Phase 2 clinical trials for PRA023 and its future clinical development, which meeting was productive. Later in the day, Prometheus management met
with representatives of Party W in person to discuss their April 12 Offer and Party W’s continued interest in a potential acquisition of Prometheus.
Also on April 13, 2023, at the direction of Prometheus management, representatives of Centerview contacted representatives of Merck and Party X
to inform them that Prometheus had received another proposal to acquire Prometheus at a significantly higher value than the March 31 Offer. Later in the
day, representatives of Merck informed representatives of Centerview that Merck had substantially completed its diligence review and would only
continue to engage with Prometheus regarding a potential acquisition if Prometheus provided specific guidance on the terms at which Prometheus would
be willing to enter into exclusivity with Merck and move quickly to enter into definitive transaction documents. Representatives of Merck and Mr.
McKenna then discussed a path to negotiate transaction documents by April 15, 2023, a transaction price of $200.00 per Company Share and Merck’s
desire for exclusivity. Mr. McKenna agreed to discuss these topics with the Board.
On April 14, 2023, members of Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview held diligence calls with
representatives of Party W and its financial advisors.
Also on April 14, 2023, the Board met, with members of Prometheus management and representatives of Latham in attendance, to discuss the April
12 Offer and Mr. McKenna’s conversation with representatives of Merck on April 13, 2023. The Board discussed and considered, among other things, (i)
the offer price in the April 12 Offer, (ii) closing certainty and any regulatory approvals that would be required in connection with a potential transaction
and, in the Board’s estimation, the significantly increased antitrust risk associated with a transaction involving Party W, (iii) the merits of exclusivity and a
$200.00 per Company Share transaction and (iv) whether other parties could provide superior offers to what Merck may agree to on the timeline
discussed. The Board also discussed the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information prepared by Prometheus management. Following these
discussions, the Board approved the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and directed Prometheus management to inform Merck that
Prometheus would agree to a transaction at $200.00 per Company Share, in cash, and that Prometheus was not willing to enter into an exclusivity
agreement, but that Prometheus would be willing to move rapidly to negotiate transaction documents at such a price.
Later in the day on April 14, 2023, Mr. McKenna called Mr. Patel to inform him that the Board was willing to proceed to negotiate definitive
transaction agreements with Merck on an expedited but non-exclusive basis with a purchase price of $200.00 per Company Share in cash. Mr. Patel
subsequently confirmed that Merck was willing to enter into a transaction at $200.00 per Company Share in cash, however, $200.00 per Company Share
represented Merck’s “best and final” time-limited offer.
Later in the day on April 14, 2023, representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”), outside legal counsel to Merck,
provided representatives of Latham a revised draft of the Merger Agreement. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Latham met with Prometheus
management to discuss the key issues in the revised Merger Agreement, including, among other things, (i) the request that specified Prometheus
stockholders execute agreements to vote in favor of the transaction at signing, (ii) the efforts required by Merck to obtain required regulatory approvals,
(iii) whether to request from Merck a reverse break fee in connection with the potential failure to obtain required regulatory approvals and the size of any
such reverse break fee, (iv) the size of the Prometheus termination fee, which Merck had proposed at 4.25% of the equity value of the potential
transaction, (v) the structure of the transaction as a one-step merger as proposed by Merck or a tender offer structure as proposed in the initial draft of
the Merger Agreement, and (vi) the appropriate Termination Date. Following discussion, Prometheus management, after consulting with members of the
Board, authorized
 
44
Table of Contents
Latham to revise the Merger Agreement and return an updated draft to Paul Weiss that, among other things, (a) rejected Merck’s request to obtain voting
agreements from certain Prometheus stockholders, (b) accepted the efforts covenant proposed by Merck, but added a reverse break fee in connection
with a failure to obtain regulatory approvals, (c) reduced the size of the Prometheus termination fee from 4.25% to 3.0% of the equity value of the potential
transaction, (d) accepted the Merck proposal to structure the transaction as a one-step merger rather than a tender offer, and (e) proposed a Termination
Date of 9 months following the execution of the Merger Agreement by the parties.
Later in the evening on April 14, 2023, representatives of Latham and Paul Weiss held a call to discuss the material open issues in the Merger
Agreement and early in the morning on April 15, 2023, Latham sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Paul Weiss reflecting the terms approved
by Prometheus management, as well as initial drafts of certain related transaction documents.
On April 15, 2023, Mr. McKenna spoke to a senior representative of Party X and informed him that a transaction with another party could be
executed later that day. The representative of Party X reiterated Party X’s interest in Prometheus. Party X did not make an offer to acquire Prometheus.
Throughout the day on April 15, 2023, Paul Weiss and Latham traded additional drafts of the Merger Agreement and related ancillary materials and
negotiated the material open points.
Later on April 15, 2023, the Board convened along with Prometheus management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham.
Members of Prometheus management reviewed with the Board the negotiations and discussions leading up to the meeting, including the timeline
required by Merck to execute definitive transaction documents, the April 12 Offer, the Board’s assessment, after consultation with its advisors, of the
closing certainty of a sale transaction with each of Merck and Party W, and the fact that Party X had not made an offer. Latham then reviewed the
proposed final terms of the Merger Agreement with the Board as negotiated with Merck and presented to the Board regarding their fiduciary obligations
under Delaware law in connection with considering and approving a sale transaction. Representatives of Centerview and Goldman Sachs then reviewed
with the Board Centerview’s and Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses of the Merger Consideration, and the Board discussed with its advisors and
Prometheus management, among other things, the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Merger Consideration. At the request of the Board,
representatives of Centerview and Goldman Sachs then rendered to the Board oral opinions, which were subsequently confirmed by delivery of written
opinions dated April 15, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered,
and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken in preparing their opinions, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company
Shares (other than as specified in such opinions) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a
detailed discussion of Centerview’s opinion, please see below under the caption “—Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC.” For a detailed discussion of
Goldman Sachs’ opinion, please see below under the caption “—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.” Executive management for Prometheus also
informed the Board that, based upon, among other things, their views of Prometheus’ prospects on a standalone basis, their consideration of all the
alternatives available to Prometheus and the information and advice provided by Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Latham, it was Prometheus executive
management’s recommendation that the Board approve the transaction as proposed by Merck upon the terms negotiated by the parties and as set forth
in the Merger Agreement. The Board then discussed the various reasons to approve the Merger and certain countervailing factors. For a detailed
description of the various reasons considered by the Board, see “The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning
on page 46 of this proxy statement. After further discussion, including on the process that led to the proposed Merger, the alternatives available to
Prometheus, including remaining as a public company, and the risks and benefits associated with the proposed transaction, the Board unanimously (i)
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of Prometheus and its stockholders, and declared it advisable for Prometheus to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable
the execution and delivery by Prometheus of the Merger Agreement, the performance by Prometheus of its covenants and agreements contained in the
Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement upon the terms and subject
to the

conditions contained therein, (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders and (iv)
resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement at
such meeting of Prometheus’ stockholders.
Immediately following the conclusion of the Board meeting, Latham and Paul Weiss finalized all transaction documents and Prometheus, Merck,
and Merger Sub executed the Merger Agreement.
On April 16, 2023, Merck and Prometheus issued a joint press release announcing the entry into the Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of the Board
The Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Prometheus and its stockholders, and declared it advisable for Prometheus to enter into the Merger
Agreement; (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution and delivery by Prometheus of the Merger Agreement, the performance by Prometheus of
its covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby upon the terms
and subject to the conditions contained therein; (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a special meeting of

The Board unanimously recommends that Prometheus stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Merger Compensation

Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Board consulted with members of Prometheus’ senior
management, representatives of Prometheus’ legal advisor, Latham & Watkins LLP, and representatives of Prometheus’ financial advisors, Centerview and
Goldman Sachs. In the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board reviewed, evaluated and considered a significant amount of
information and numerous factors and benefits, including those listed below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which the
Board viewed as supporting its (i) determination that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Prometheus and its stockholders and its direction that Prometheus enter into the Merger Agreement; (ii)
approval and declaration that it is advisable for Prometheus to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement; (iii) direction that the adoption of the Merger
Agreement be submitted to a vote of Prometheus’ stockholders at the Special Meeting; and (iv) resolution, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Prometheus’ stockholders:
 
•
Premium to Market Price. The Board considered the relationship of the Merger Consideration to the price of the Company Shares
immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement and the recent historical market price and volatility of the Company Shares,
including the fact that the Merger Consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 75% to the $114.01 closing price per Company
Share on Nasdaq on April 14, 2023, the last trading day prior to the date on which the Merger Agreement was executed; (ii) a premium of
approximately 75% to the trailing volume-weighted average price per share of $114.33 for the thirty (30) trading day period ended April 14,
2023; (iii) a premium of approximately 58% to the 52-week high closing trading price per share of $126.29 for the 52-week period ended April
14, 2023; (iv) a premium of approximately 82% to the price per share of $110.00 at which Prometheus last raised capital on December 8, 2022;
and (v) a premium of approximately 953% to the price per share of $19.00 at which Prometheus issued Company Shares in its initial public
offering on March 16, 2021. The Board believed that the Merger
 
46Table of Contents
Consideration represents the highest value reasonably available for the Company Shares for the foreseeable future, taking into account the
Board’s familiarity with the business strategy, assets and prospects of Prometheus and the recent historical market price of the Company
Shares.
 
•
Certainty of Value. The Board considered the all-cash nature of the Merger Consideration to be received by Prometheus’ stockholders in
the Merger, which would provide liquidity and certainty of value to our stockholders while avoiding exposure to Prometheus’ clinical,
regulatory, commercialization and other business risks. Taking into account the business, operations, prospects, strategic and short and
long term operating plans, assets, liabilities and financial condition of Prometheus, the Board weighed the certainty of realizing compelling
value for Company Shares by virtue of the Merger against the uncertain prospect that the trading value of Company Shares would
approach the Merger Consideration in the foreseeable future and the risks and uncertainties associated with our business generally,
including those described below and those discussed in Prometheus’ public filings with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement.
 
•
Possible Strategic Alternatives. The Board considered the process conducted by Prometheus, with the assistance of representatives of
Centerview and Goldman Sachs, to identify whether other potential parties might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of Prometheus,
taking into account the expected interest of such parties generally, their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size, their
ability to provide deal certainty, and their ability to move expeditiously and efficiently to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an
acquisition of Prometheus and consummate such transaction. After a thorough review of strategic alternatives and discussions with
management and Prometheus’ financial and legal advisors, the Board determined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to
Prometheus stockholders than the potential value that might result from other strategic options available, including, but not limited to,
remaining a standalone public company.
 
•
Full and Fair Value. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration of $200.00 per Company Share represents full and fair value for our
Company Shares, taking into account the Board’s familiarity with the business strategy, assets and prospects of Prometheus on a
standalone basis and the relative certainty of the cash consideration payable in the Merger as compared to the risks and uncertainties of
continuing on a standalone basis as an independent public company.
 
•
Highest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The Board believed that the Merger Consideration of $200.00 per Company Share represents the
highest value reasonably obtainable for our Company Shares for the foreseeable future, taking into account the business, operations,
prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Prometheus. The Board also considered the progress and
the outcome of Prometheus’ negotiations with Merck, including the increase in the consideration offered by Merck from the time of its initial
expression of interest to the end of the negotiations, a number of changes in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement from the
version initially proposed by Merck that were favorable to Prometheus, Merck’s communications that its offer would be withdrawn if an
agreement was not reached expeditiously, and the fact that a number of other strategic parties that had been contacted with respect to a
potential acquisition of Prometheus had determined not to engage with Prometheus, had determined that they would not be capable of
entering into a strategic transaction with Prometheus at such time, or had otherwise failed to submit a proposal that the Board considered
compelling relative to the terms of the Merger and the Merger Consideration of $200.00 per Company Share. Further, the Board believed,
based on these negotiations, that the Merger Consideration was the highest price per share that Merck was willing to pay and that the
Merger Agreement contained the most favorable terms to Prometheus to which Merck was willing to agree.
 
•
Product Commercialization and Development Risks. The Board considered the fact that Prometheus has limited marketing, sales and
distribution experience and capabilities, and, if Prometheus’ product candidates receive regulatory approval, Prometheus would need to
develop or access such capabilities
 
47
Table of Contents
within the United States and globally, which it may fail to do successfully or at reasonable cost, along with the risks related to market
acceptance and other factors affecting the revenues and profitability of product candidates generally.
 
•
Likelihood of Consummation. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the likelihood of consummation, based upon the scope of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger,
the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, the remedies available to Prometheus under the Merger Agreement in the
event of various breaches by Merck, including specific performance, and Merck’s reputation in the biopharmaceutical industry and its
financial capacity to complete an acquisition of this size, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction with Merck
could be completed relatively expeditiously and in an orderly manner.
 
•
Centerview’s and Goldman Sachs’ Respective Opinions and Related Analyses. The Board considered the opinions of Centerview and
Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board on April 15, 2023, which were subsequently confirmed by delivery of written opinions dated such
date that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview and Goldman Sachs in preparing their respective opinions, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Shares (other than as specified in such opinions) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the captions “Opinion of
Centerview Partners LLC” and “Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.”
 
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which was the product of arm’s-
length negotiations with the assistance of Prometheus’ advisors, including the structure of the transaction, the all-cash form of the Merger
Consideration, the limited scope of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, and the customary nature of the representations,
warranties, and the covenants and agreements of the parties. For the reasons noted below, the Board believed that the provisions of the
Merger Agreement were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Prometheus and our stockholders. In particular:
 
•
No Financing Condition. The Board considered the representation of Merck that Merck would have available sufficient funds for the
satisfaction of all of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses required to be paid by
Merck or Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and that the consummation of the Merger is not subject to a
financing condition.
 
•
No Solicitation Covenants and Fiduciary Outs. The Board considered the non-solicitation covenants and “fiduciary out” provisions
of the Merger Agreement, which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof and limitations set forth therein, permit Prometheus to
furnish information to, and to engage in discussions with, third parties that make unsolicited Acquisition Proposals meeting certain
criteria, permit the Board to change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances
and permit Prometheus to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal,
subject to, among other things, payment of a termination fee to Merck. The Board further considered its ability to change its
recommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement in response to an Intervening Event if the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable law. The Board further considered
the fact that the Prometheus Termination Fee, in the opinion of the Board, (i) is reasonable in light of the overall terms of the Merger
Agreement and the benefits of the Merger, (ii) is consistent with the amount of such fees payable in comparable transactions on a
relative basis, (iii) would not be a substantial impediment or preclude another party from making a competing proposal to acquire
Prometheus, and (iv) fair in light of the Merck Termination Fee in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to
effect the Merger prior to the
 
48
Table of Contents
Termination Date because of an inability to obtain the necessary competition approvals or due to the entry of a final, non-appealable
antitrust law or order permanently restraining, enjoining, preventing, or prohibiting or making illegal the Merger.
 
•
Termination Date. The Board considered the fact that the Termination Date under the Merger Agreement, on which either party,
subject to certain exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement, allows for sufficient time to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, but also prevents the Merger Agreement from being extended for an unreasonable amount
of time, which could adversely impact operations.
 
•
Enforcement. The Board considered Prometheus’ ability to obtain specific enforcement of the obligations of Merck and Merger Sub
under the Merger Agreement, thereby ensuring that Prometheus has an appropriate remedy in the event Merck and Merger Sub were
to decline to comply with their obligations under the Merger Agreement.
 
•
Stockholder Approval; Appraisal Rights. The Board considered that the adoption of the Merger Agreement would be subject to the
approval of our stockholders, that stockholders would be free to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and that
stockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law
will be entitled to such appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.
 
•
Conditions to Closing; Interim Operations. The Board considered the fact that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
minimize, to the extent reasonably practical, the risk that a condition to consummation of the Merger would not be satisfied and also
provide reasonable flexibility to operate Prometheus’ business during the pendency of the Merger.
The Board, in consultation with members of Prometheus’ senior management, also assessed Prometheus’ prospects for substantially increasing
stockholder value as a standalone company in excess of the Merger Consideration given the risks and uncertainties in Prometheus’ business, including,
but not limited to, the following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance) and those discussed in Prometheus’ public filings with the SEC
(see “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement):
 
•
Prometheus’ approach to the discovery and development of precision medicines based on Prometheus’ Prometheus360TM platform is
unproven, and Prometheus does not know whether it will be able to develop any therapeutics or diagnostic products of commercial value,
or if competing technological approaches will limit the commercial value of its product candidates and diagnostic candidates or render
Prometheus360 obsolete.
 
•
Prometheus’ Enroll360TM platform is also unproven, and Prometheus does not know whether enrolling and profiling patients into Enroll360
will translate into any improvement over traditionally slow enrollment rates or ability to enroll patients into future biomarker-guided clinical
trials who are more likely to respond to Prometheus’ therapeutic candidates.
 
•
Prometheus is early in its development efforts and all of its development programs are in the clinical, preclinical or discovery stage and if
Prometheus is unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize product candidates and related
diagnostic candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, Prometheus’ business will be materially harmed.
 
•
Preclinical and clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and the results of preclinical
studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results and Prometheus’ product candidates may not have favorable
results in clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all.
 
•
Any difficulties or delays in the commencement or completion, or termination or suspension, of Prometheus’ ongoing or planned clinical
trials, including as a result of Prometheus never having
 
49
Table of Contents
completed a Phase 3 registrational program, could result in increased costs to Prometheus, delay or limit Prometheus’ ability to generate
revenue and adversely affect Prometheus’ commercial prospects.
 
•
Prometheus’ limited operating history, the fact that Prometheus has incurred significant operating losses since its inception and expects to
incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and the fact that Prometheus may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve
and maintain profitability.
 
•
In the near term, Prometheus’ ability to generate revenue will depend primarily on collaboration revenue.
 
•
Prometheus has entered into, and may in the future seek to enter into, collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements and may not
be successful in doing so, and even if successful, Prometheus may relinquish valuable rights and may not realize the benefits of such
relationships.
 
•
Prometheus relies on third parties to conduct many of its preclinical studies and clinical trials and to manufacture its product candidates,
and these third parties may not perform satisfactorily.
 
•
Prometheus faces significant competition, and if Prometheus’ competitors develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than
Prometheus does or their technologies or product candidates are more effective, Prometheus’ ability to develop and successfully
commercialize products may be adversely affected.
 
•
If Prometheus is unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for its therapeutic and diagnostic programs, products and other proprietary
technologies it may develop, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, Prometheus’ competitors could
develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to Prometheus’, and Prometheus’ ability to successfully
commercialize its therapeutic and diagnostic programs, products and other proprietary technologies it may develop may be adversely
affected.
 
•
Prometheus may not be able to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.
 
•
Prometheus depends on intellectual property licensed from third parties, and its licensors may not always act in Prometheus’ best interests.
 
•
If Prometheus fails to comply with its obligations under its intellectual property licenses, if the licenses are terminated or if disputes
regarding these licenses arise, Prometheus could lose significant rights that are important to its business.
 
•
Prometheus will require substantial additional financing to achieve its goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on
acceptable terms, or at all, could force Prometheus to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its development programs, commercialization efforts or
other operations.
 
•
The current state of the U.S. and global economies, including the recent downward trend in the biopharmaceutical financial markets,
increased volatility resulting from escalating political and global trade tensions, and the current and potential impact in both the near term
and long term on the biopharmaceutical industry and the future commercialization efforts required with respect to Prometheus’ therapeutic
and diagnostic products or product candidates that may become approved for sale, including the numerous risks, costs and uncertainties
associated with research, development and commercialization of Prometheus’ pipeline programs.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board, in consultation with members of Prometheus’ senior management and representatives of Prometheus’
outside financial and legal advisors, also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (which are not listed in any relative
order of importance):
 
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Earnings or Growth. The Board considered that the nature of the Merger as a cash transaction
means that, if the Merger is consummated, our stockholders will not participate in future earnings or growth of Prometheus and will not
benefit from any appreciation in the value of Prometheus’ business, the success of any of Prometheus’ product candidates or any
appreciation in the shares of the surviving corporation.
 
50
Table of Contents
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, might not be consummated, and that consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions that may not be within our control, including receipt of the necessary regulatory clearances and approvals and that no
Company Material Adverse Effect with respect to Prometheus has occurred that is continuing. The Board considered the fact that there can
be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied and, as a result, it is possible that
the Merger may not be consummated even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by our stockholders. The Board considered the fact that if
the Merger is not consummated (i) Prometheus will have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility of
disruption to our operations, diversion of management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our
business relationships, (ii) the trading price of the Company Shares may be adversely affected, and (iii) the market’s perceptions of our
prospects could be adversely affected.
 
•
Interim Operating Covenants. The Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger,
which may delay or prevent Prometheus from undertaking potential business opportunities that may arise, may have a material adverse
effect on our ability to respond to changing market and business conditions in a timely manner (or at all), or may negatively affect our ability
to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. The Board also considered that the focus and resources of Prometheus’ management may
become diverted from other important business opportunities and operational matters while working to consummate the Merger, which
could adversely affect our business.
 
•
No Solicitation Covenants and Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that, subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement
precludes Prometheus and its representatives from soliciting, or entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations relating to,
alternative acquisition proposals, and requires Prometheus to pay to Merck the Prometheus Termination Fee if the Merger Agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, including a termination of the Merger Agreement by Prometheus to enter into a definitive
agreement for a Superior Proposal, as described in “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee; Certain Expenses” beginning on page 100 of
this proxy statement. The Board also considered, but did not consider preclusive, the fact that the right afforded to Merck under the Merger
Agreement to propose amendments or modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in response to a Superior
Proposal may discourage other parties that might otherwise have an interest in a business combination with, or an acquisition of,
Prometheus. The Board also considered that the amount of the termination fee, as compared to termination fees in transactions of a similar
size, in the opinion of the Board, was reasonable and would not likely deter competing bids. The Board also recognized that the provisions
in the Merger Agreement relating to non-solicitation and the termination fee were required by Merck as conditions to entering into the
Merger Agreement.
 
•
Effect of Transaction Announcement. The Board considered the potential effect of the announcement of the Merger Agreement, including
effects on our stock price and operations, including our relationships with suppliers, distributors, vendors, collaborators and employees,
and our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well
as the possibility of a suit, action or proceeding in respect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
•
Transaction Costs. The Board considered the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and
expenses in connection with the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.
 
•
Taxable Transaction. The Board considered that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to our stockholders that are
treated as U.S. Holders (as defined in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Holders of
Company Shares” beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement) for United States federal income tax purposes.
 
51
Table of Contents
•
Interests of Directors and Executive Officers. The Board considered the possibility that Prometheus’ directors and executive officers may
have interests in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Prometheus’
stockholders generally. See “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger” beginning on
page 64 of this proxy statement.
After considering the foregoing potentially negative factors, the Board concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger substantially
outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive, but includes the
material reasons and factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions and recommendation in relation to the Merger, the Merger Agreement
and the transactions proposed thereby. In light of the variety of reasons and factors considered and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not
find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons or factors considered in reaching their
determinations and recommendations. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including thorough discussions
with, and questioning of, members of our senior management and representatives of our outside financial advisors and legal counsel. Individual directors
may have given differing weights to different factors or may have had different reasons for their ultimate determination. In addition, the Board did not
reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. Instead, the Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors
and reasons described above and determined in its business judgment that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits of the Merger to the stockholders of
Prometheus outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain
information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 36 of this proxy statement.",56,62

On April 15, 2023, Centerview rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated such date, that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the
review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion, dated April 15, 2023, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered,
and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated herein
by reference. The summary of the written opinion of Centerview set forth below is qualified in its entirety to the full text of Centerview’s written opinion
attached as Annex B. Centerview’s financial advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Board (in their
capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes of its consideration of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and Centerview’s opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date thereof, to
the holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Centerview’s opinion did not address any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any Prometheus stockholder or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the
Merger or otherwise act with respect to the Merger or any other matter.  
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion.
 
52Table of Contents
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Centerview reviewed, among other things:
 
•
a draft of the Merger Agreement dated April 15, 2023 (the “Draft Merger Agreement”);
 
•
Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Prometheus for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021;
 
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Prometheus;
 
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Prometheus;
 
•
certain other communications from Prometheus to its stockholders; and
 
•
certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of Prometheus,
including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to the Company prepared by management of the Company and
furnished to Centerview by the Company for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, which are referred to in this summary of Centerview’s
opinion as the “Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, and are described further below under the section entitled “—Certain
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, and which are collectively referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the
“Internal Data.”
Centerview also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of Prometheus regarding their assessment
of the Internal Data. In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data for Prometheus. Centerview also compared certain
of the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Centerview
deemed relevant, and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as Centerview deemed
appropriate.
Centerview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by Centerview for purposes of its opinion and, with
Prometheus’ consent, Centerview relied upon such information as being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview assumed, at Prometheus’
direction, that the Internal Data (including, without limitation, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information) were reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Prometheus as to the matters covered thereby and Centerview
relied, at Prometheus’ direction, on the Internal Data for purposes of Centerview’s analysis and opinion. Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to
the Internal Data or the assumptions on which it was based. In addition, at Prometheus’ direction, Centerview did not make any independent evaluation
or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of Prometheus and was not asked to conduct, and
did not conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of Prometheus. Centerview assumed, at Prometheus’ direction, that the final executed
Merger Agreement would not differ in any respect material to Centerview’s analysis or opinion from the Draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Centerview.
Centerview also assumed, at Prometheus’ direction, that the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and in
accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term,
condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the
necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction, condition or
other change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion. Centerview did not evaluate and
did not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of Prometheus, or the ability of Prometheus to pay its obligations when they come due, or as
to the impact of the Merger on such matters, under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Centerview is not
a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisor, and Centerview expressed no opinion as to any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.

Centerview’s opinion expressed no view as to, and did not address, Prometheus’ underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the
Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to Prometheus or in
which Prometheus might engage. Centerview’s opinion was limited to and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of
Centerview’s written opinion, to the holders of the Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. For purposes of its opinion, Centerview was not asked to, and Centerview did not, express any view on, and its
opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the
Merger, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into in connection with or otherwise contemplated
by the Merger, including, without limitation, the fairness of the Merger or any other term or aspect of the Merger to, or any consideration to be received
in connection therewith by, or the impact of the Merger on, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Prometheus or
any other party. In addition, Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect
of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Prometheus or any party, or class of such persons in
connection with the Merger, whether relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Centerview’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, currency, market and
other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to Centerview as of, the date of Centerview’s written opinion, and
Centerview does not have any obligation or responsibility to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events
occurring after the date of Centerview’s written opinion. Centerview’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Prometheus stockholder or
any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to the Merger or any
other matter. Centerview’s financial advisory services and its written opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Board (in their
capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes of its consideration of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The issuance of Centerview’s opinion was approved by the Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion
Committee.
Summary of Centerview Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Board in connection with Centerview’s opinion, dated
April 15, 2023. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by,
and underlying the opinion of, Centerview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to
those financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so the
reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized below should not be taken to be Centerview’s view of the actual
value of Prometheus. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the tables below without considering all financial analyses or
factors or the full narrative description of such analyses or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview’s financial analyses and its opinion. In performing its analyses,
Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Prometheus or any other parties to the Merger. None of Prometheus, Merck, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other
person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below.
In addition, analyses relating to the value of Prometheus do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which Prometheus may actually be
 
54
Table of Contents
sold. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it
existed on or before April 14, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger) and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis 
Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Prometheus based on the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. A discounted
cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or set of assets by calculating the “present value” of
estimated future cash flows of the asset or set of assets. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by
discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the
opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of per Company Share equity values by (a) discounting to present value as of March 31,
2023 using discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 13.5% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of Prometheus’ weighted average cost of capital) and using a
mid-year convention: (i) the forecasted risk-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows of Prometheus over the period beginning April 1, 2023 and
ending on December 31, 2044, utilized by Centerview as set forth in Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, (ii) an implied terminal value of
Prometheus, calculated by Centerview by assuming that unlevered free cash flows would decline in perpetuity after December 31, 2044 at a rate of free
cash flow decline of 50% year over year (except for platform, overhead general and administrative and unallocated research and development), (iii) tax
savings from usage of Prometheus’ estimated federal net operating losses of approximately $164 million as of December 31, 2022 and future losses, as
reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, (b) adding to the foregoing results Prometheus’ net estimated cash and cash equivalents of
$715 million as of March 31, 2023, as provided by Prometheus management, and (c) subtracting from the foregoing results the present value of the impact
of assumed equity raises of $500 million in 2025 and $400 million in 2026, as set forth in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. Centerview
divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding Company Shares (determined using the treasury stock method
and taking into account the dilutive impact of outstanding in-the-money options and restricted stock units) as of April 13, 2023, based on the Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information, resulting in a range of implied equity values per Company Share of $128.60 to $152.35 rounded to the nearest $0.05.
Centerview then compared the results of the above analysis to the $200.00 per Company Share value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Other Factors
Centerview noted for the Board certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
 
•
Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of the Company Shares during the 52-week
period ended April 14, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger), which reflected low and high stock closing
prices for Prometheus during such period of approximately $22.39 to $126.29 per Company Share, rounded to the nearest $0.01.
 
•
Analyst Price Target Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for the Company Shares in recently published, publicly available
Wall Street research analyst reports as of April 14, 2023 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger), which
indicated low and high stock price targets for Prometheus ranging from $138.00 to $225.00 per Company Share.
 
55
Table of Contents
•
Premiums Paid Analysis. Centerview performed an analysis of premiums paid in selected transactions involving publicly traded
biopharmaceutical companies for which premium data were available. The premiums in this analysis were calculated by comparing the per
share acquisition price in each transaction (excluding any contingent consideration) to the closing price of the target company’s common
stock for the date one day prior to the date on which the trading price of the target’s common stock was perceived to be affected by a
potential transaction. Based on such analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment,
Centerview applied a range of 50% to 80% to Prometheus’ closing stock price on April 14, 2023 (the last trading day before the public
announcement of the Merger) of $114.01, which resulted in an implied price range of approximately $171.00 to $205.20 per Company Share,

General
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or
analysis that it considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of the analyses.
Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in its evaluation of the Merger.
Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or Prometheus Management with respect
to the Merger Consideration or as to whether the Board would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration
for the transaction was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Prometheus and Merck and was approved by the Board. Centerview
provided advice to Prometheus during these negotiations. Centerview did not, however recommend any specific amount of consideration to Prometheus
or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction.
Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory
and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, except for Centerview’s current engagement, Centerview had not
been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Prometheus, and Centerview did not receive any compensation from Prometheus during
such period. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview provided financial advisory services unrelated to Prometheus, to Merck,
including in connection with Merck’s spin-off of Organon & Co. in 2021 and other strategic matters, and Centerview received between $15 million and $25
million in aggregate compensation from Merck during such period. Centerview may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to
Prometheus or Merck or their respective affiliates in the future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview’s and its
affiliates’ directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview’s affiliates or related investment funds and
(iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time
acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or
investments in, Prometheus, Merck or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the Merger.
The Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger based on Centerview’s familiarity with Prometheus, their
reputation as an internationally recognized investment banking firm and their substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Centerview is
an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger.
In connection with Centerview’s services as the financial advisor to the Board, Prometheus has agreed to pay Centerview an aggregate fee of $70.5
million, $2.0 million of which was payable upon the earlier to occur of

(i) the date on which Centerview advised the Board that it was prepared to render its opinion and (ii) the rendering of the opinion and $68.5 million of
which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Prometheus has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview’s expenses
arising, and to indemnify Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview’s engagement.

Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of April 15, 2023, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, the $200.00 in cash per Company Share to be paid to the holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of Company Shares pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of Company Shares.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated April 15, 2023, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services
and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger and other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Company Shares should vote with respect to the
Merger, or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:
 
•
the Merger Agreement;
 
•
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Prometheus for the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2022;
 
•
Prometheus’ Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein dated March 11, 2021 relating to Prometheus’
initial public offering, dated February 19, 2021;
 
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Prometheus;
 
•
certain other communications from Prometheus to its stockholders;
 
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Prometheus; and
 
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company and certain forecasts related to the expected utilization by the Company of
certain net operating loss carryforwards, in each case, as prepared by the management of Prometheus and approved for our use by
Prometheus (referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the “Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, and which are
summarized in the section entitled “The Merger—Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 61 of this
proxy statement).
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Prometheus regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale
for, and the potential benefits of, the Merger and the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Prometheus;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Company Shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for Prometheus with
similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations in the biopharma industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as
Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Prometheus’ consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information
 
57Table of Contents
provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs
assumed with Prometheus’ consent that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Prometheus. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of
the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Prometheus and it was not furnished
with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of
any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Prometheus to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the
Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Prometheus; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of Company
Shares, as of the date of the opinion, of the $200.00 in cash per Company Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or Merger or any term or aspect
of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including, the
fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other
constituencies of Prometheus; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or
employees of Prometheus, or class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $200.00 in cash per Company Share to be paid
to the holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs is not expressing
any opinion as to the prices at which the Company Shares will trade at any time or, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock
markets on Prometheus, Merck or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of Prometheus or Merck or the ability of
Prometheus or Merck to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs
assumes no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its
opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and opinion are provided for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration
of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
holder of Company Shares should vote with respect to such Merger or any other matter. The opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of
Goldman Sachs.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board in connection with rendering the opinion
described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs,
nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Except as otherwise noted,
the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before April 14, 2023, the
last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Summary of Financial Analyses
Implied Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia described below based on the consideration to be paid to
holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
 
58
Table of Contents
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the consideration to be paid to holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of
Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement relative to:
 
•
$114.01, the closing price per Company Share as of April 14, 2023 (which is referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the
“Unaffected Share Price”);
 
•
$129.60, the highest intra-day trading price of Company Shares over the 52-week period ended April 14, 2023 (which is referred to in this
section of the proxy statement as the “52-week High”); and
 
•
$114.33, the volume weighted average price (which is referred to in this section of the proxy statement as “VWAP”) of Company Shares over
the 30-trading-day time period ended April 14, 2023 (which is referred to in this section of the proxy statement as the “30-day VWAP”).
The results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative
discounted cash flow analysis on Prometheus to derive a range of illustrative present values per Company Share. Using the mid-year convention for
discounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting estimates of Prometheus’ weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”),
Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2023 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Prometheus for the second, third and fourth
quarters of fiscal year 2023 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2044 as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and (ii) a
range of illustrative terminal values for Prometheus, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 2.0% to a terminal
year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by Prometheus, as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. In addition,
using a mid-year convention and discount rate of 11.5% to 13.5%, reflecting an estimate of Prometheus’ WACC, Goldman Sachs discounted to present
value as of March 31, 2023 the estimated benefits of Prometheus’ net operating losses (“NOLs”) for the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year
2023 through fiscal year 2044 as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by
Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and market
expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the
Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Prometheus’ target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-
term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Prometheus, as well as certain financial
metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Prometheus by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman
Sachs then added to the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived, the amount of Prometheus’ net cash balance as of March 31, 2023, and the net
present value of the $500 million in financing with a 6% gross spread expected in 2025 and $400 million in financing with a 6% gross spread expected in
2026, as set forth in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information and in each case, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the
management of Prometheus, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Prometheus. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity
values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding Company Shares, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management
of Prometheus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per Company Share ranging from $129.78 to $161.59.

Premia Paid Analysis—Undisturbed Closing Stock Price. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the
acquisition premia for select transactions announced in the 10 years preceding April 14, 2023 involving a public company in the biopharmaceutical
industry based in the United States as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were between $5 billion and $15 billion. For the
entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in
the 23 transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median
premium of 62% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 48% and 75th percentile premium of 77% across the period.
Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 48% to 77% to the undisturbed closing price per Company Share
of $114.01 as of April 14, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity values per Company Share of $168.51 to $201.57.
Premia Paid Analysis—52-Week Intraday High Stock Price. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the
acquisition premia for select transactions announced in the 10 years preceding April 14, 2023 involving a public company in the biopharmaceutical
industry based in the United States as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were between $5 billion and $15 billion. For the
entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in
the 23 transactions relative to the target’s 52-week intraday high price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median
premium of 28% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 19% and 75th percentile premium of 56% across the period.
Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 19% to 56% to the 52-week intraday high per Company Share of
$129.60 as of April 14, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity values per Company Share of $154.28 to $202.51.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis
of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to Prometheus or Merck or the contemplated transaction.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a financial point
of view of the $200.00 in cash per Company Share to be paid to the holders (other than Merck and its affiliates) of Company Shares pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Prometheus, Merck, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes
responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Prometheus and Merck and was approved by the Board.
Goldman Sachs provided advice to Prometheus during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of
consideration to Prometheus or the Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described herein, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in making its
determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not
 
60
Table of Contents
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates
and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at
any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default
swaps and other financial instruments of Prometheus, Merck any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be
involved in the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Prometheus in connection with, and
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain
financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Prometheus and its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has
received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as acted as bookrunner to Prometheus in connection to a follow-on equity raise in
December 2022. During the two-year period ended April 15, 2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting
services provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking to Prometheus and/or its affiliates of approximately $13 million. Goldman Sachs also has
provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Merck and its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment
Banking has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Merck in connection to its acquisition of Acceleron
Pharma Inc. in November 2021, as joint bookrunner to Merck with respect to its offering of certain notes in December 2021, as joint lead arranger and joint
bookrunner to Organon & Co., a subsidiary of Merck, with respect to its offering of certain term loans and other secured and unsecured debt in June
2021, and as letter of credit issuer to Organon & Co. in connection to a revolving credit facility in June 2021. During the two-year period ended April 15,
2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking
to Merck and/or its affiliates of approximately $32 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services
to Prometheus, Merck and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking may receive compensation.
The Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 27, 2022 (as amended), Prometheus engaged Goldman
Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated transaction. The engagement letter between Prometheus and Goldman Sachs
provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $70.5 million, $1
million of which became payable at announcement of the Merger, and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In
addition, Prometheus has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify
Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities that may arise out of its engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities
laws.

We do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to our future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty,
unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates and the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future
periods. However, Prometheus’ management regularly prepares and reviews with the Board estimates regarding the success and timing of the
development of, regulatory filings and approvals for and the commercialization of our products and product candidates. In connection with our strategic
planning process and the Board’s evaluation of the Merger, as described further in the section captioned “The Merger—Background of the Merger”
beginning on page 39 of this proxy statement, Prometheus’ management prepared and reviewed with the Board certain unaudited prospective financial
information of Prometheus as an independent company for the fiscal years 2023 through 2044, as prepared and used as described below (referred to as
the “Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”).
 
61Table of Contents
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and was provided to the Board
for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating the Merger. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was also provided to, approved
by Prometheus for use by, and relied upon by, Centerview and Goldman Sachs, Prometheus’ financial advisors, for the purposes of Centerview’s and
Goldman Sachs’s financial analyses and fairness opinions in connection with the Merger (as described in more detail in the sections captioned “The
Merger—Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC” and “The Merger—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” beginning on pages 52 and 57 of this proxy
statement, respectively), and were the only financial projections with respect to the Company used by Centerview and Goldman Sachs in performing such
financial analyses. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not provided to Merck or any other prospective bidder. The Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information includes estimates of Prometheus’ financial performance on a risk-adjusted basis. With Prometheus’ consent,
Centerview and Goldman Sachs each assumed that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best then available estimates and judgments of our management as to our future financial performance, and relied on Prometheus’ assessments as to the
validity of, and risks associated with, our products and product candidates.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed based on Prometheus’ management’s knowledge of and assumptions with respect
to Prometheus’ business, including with respect to the commercialization of Prometheus’ PRA023 pipeline drug candidate for the treatment of immune-
mediated diseases including ulcerative colitis (“UC”), Crohn’s Disease, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease and Prometheus’
PRA052 pipeline drug candidate for the treatment of UC. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was developed without giving effect to the
Merger, including any impact of the negotiation or execution of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, the expenses that have already or may be incurred
in connection with completing the Merger or any changes to Prometheus’ operations or strategy that may be implemented during the pendency of or
following the consummation of the Merger. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also does not consider the effect of any failure of the
Merger to be completed and it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In addition, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information was not prepared
with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to
prospective financial information. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled,
reviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, (2) expressed any opinion or
any other form of assurance on such information or the achievability of the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information or (3) assumed any
responsibility for the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.
Because the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it is susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as
well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information also covers
multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
is not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not fact
and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of our future results.
Although the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates
as to future events. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to achieve our goals for the
development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates, including on the timeline assumed for purposes of the
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information reflects assumptions and uncertainties that are subject to
change. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information not to be achieved are described in
 
62
Table of Contents
various risk factors described in the section captioned “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 36 of this
proxy statement, and in our other filings with the SEC, including those listed under the section captioned “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 114 of this proxy statement. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there
can be no assurance that the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those
contained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, whether or not the Merger is consummated. The Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information also reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information may
differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and does not consider any events or circumstances after the date that it was prepared, including the
announcement of the entry into the Merger Agreement. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information has not been updated or revised to reflect
information or results after the date it was prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws, we do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that
such information was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events. Prometheus has or may report results of operations for periods included in
the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information that were or will be completed following the preparation of the Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information. Stockholders and investors are urged to refer to Prometheus’ periodic filings with the SEC for information on Prometheus’ actual historical
results.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information are “non-GAAP financial measures.” These are
financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a
substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are
limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.
In certain circumstances, including those applicable to the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, financial measures included in forecasts
provided to a financial advisor and a board of directors in connection with a business combination transaction are excluded from the definition of “non-
GAAP financial measures” under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not subject to SEC
rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP
financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Board, Centerview or Goldman Sachs.
Accordingly, no reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement.
The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information in this proxy statement, neither we nor any of our representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding our ultimate
performance as compared to the information contained in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information. The inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, Prometheus or any other person considered, or now considers, the
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results. Further, the inclusion of the Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Prometheus that the information presented is material. The
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information that was
provided to the Board, Centerview, and Goldman Sachs. The Unaudited Prospective Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement in order
to influence any Prometheus stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights
with respect to their shares.
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
Various judgments and assumptions were made when preparing the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, including, among others (1)
revenue estimates based on various assumptions, including with respect

to addressable patient population, United States and EU commercial launch years, market penetration, time to peak sales, peak sales, inflationary factors
and pricing and exclusivity, and potential outcomes with respect thereto for the commercialization of the PRA023, PRA052 and other potential pipeline
drug candidates, (2) the probability of success in obtaining regulatory approval of Prometheus’ drug candidates, (3) the entry into partnerships for the
development and commercialization of certain product candidates outside of the United States and EU with various upfront, milestone and royalty
payments assumptions, (4) assumptions with respect to cost of goods sold and estimated sales, marketing and distribution expenses, with certain of such
assumptions estimated on a product-by-product basis, (5) estimated royalty and milestone expenses payable by and to Prometheus based on the terms of
Prometheus’ existing and future potential partner relationships, (6) variable research and development expenses estimated based on the phase of each
product’s development and launch, (7) estimated benefits of Prometheus’ net operating losses of approximately $164 million as of December 31, 2022 and
estimated future losses, (8) the impact of $500 million in financing expected in 2025 and $400 million in financing expected in 2026, and (9) corporate
general and administrative expenses generally.
The following table presents estimates of Prometheus’ net revenue, gross profit, EBIT, net income and unlevered free cash flow, in each case, for
the fiscal years 2023 through 2044, as reflected in the Unaudited Prospective Financial Information, as approved by Prometheus management.

Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Prometheus in the Merger",71,74

Members of the Board and Prometheus’ executive officers may have various interests in the Merger that may be in addition to, or different from, the
interests of Prometheus stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of these potential interests and considered them at the time they
approved the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that Prometheus stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These potential
interests are described below.
Treatment of Equity Awards
Each of our directors and executive officers hold outstanding Prometheus equity awards. The Prometheus equity awards held by our directors and
executive officers immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated
 
64Table of Contents
in the Merger in the same manner as Prometheus equity awards held by employees generally. At the Effective Time, outstanding Prometheus equity
awards held by our directors and executive officers will be treated as follows:
 
•
Each Prometheus stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate
number of Company Shares underlying such Prometheus stock option by (ii) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration less the
applicable per share exercise price of such Prometheus stock option; and
 
•
Each Prometheus RSU award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such
Prometheus RSU award by (ii) the Merger Consideration.
The following table sets forth, for each of Prometheus’ directors and executive officers, (i) the number and value of Company Shares subject to
vested Prometheus stock options, (ii) the number and value of Company Shares subject to unvested Prometheus stock options, (iii) the number and value
of unvested Prometheus RSUs (which, in the case of each of Prometheus’ non-employee directors, reflects the Prometheus RSUs to be granted to such
director as his or her annual award on May 19, 2023) and (iv) the total value of Company Shares subject to Prometheus stock options and unvested
RSUs, in each case, held by such director or executive officer as of May 9, 2023. All such amounts actually payable to each of Prometheus’ directors and
executive officers will be less any required withholding taxes and without interest. No director or executive officer held any Prometheus Restricted Shares
as of May 9, 2023. Except as noted above, these amounts do not attempt to forecast any additional equity award grants, issuances or forfeitures that may
occur prior to the Effective Time following the date of this proxy statement. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, the actual amounts to be received by Prometheus’ directors and executive officers may materially differ from the
amounts set forth below. This table also does not include any outstanding rights to purchase shares under the ESPP held by our executive officers. For
additional information regarding the ESPP, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on page 79 of this proxy
statement.

For purposes of this table, the value of each Prometheus stock option is equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Company
Shares underlying the vested or unvested portion, as applicable, of such Prometheus stock option by (B) the excess of (i) $200.00 over (ii) the
exercise price of such Prometheus stock option.

The actual number of Prometheus RSUs to be granted to each director on May 19, 2023 will be determined by dividing the aggregate total dollar
value of each director’s annual cash retainer and, if applicable, additional committee retainers ($420,000 for Ms. Adams, $410,000 for Mr. Hassan,
$400,000 for Dr. Hendrix, $400,000 for Mr. Laur, $440,000 for Mr. Papa, $400,000 for Dr. Swain, and $400,000 for

RSUs to be granted pursuant to such awards, determined by dividing the aggregate total dollar value of each director’s annual cash retainer and, if
applicable, additional committee retainers (as set forth above) by the closing price of the Company Shares on May 8, 2023 ($194.22).

For purposes of this table, the value of each Company Share underlying the Prometheus RSU awards is equal to $200.00.

Change in Control Severance Benefits in Executive Officer Employment Arrangements
Each of Prometheus’ executive officers has entered into an employment letter agreement with Prometheus, pursuant to which the executive officer is
entitled to severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment, including after a change in control (which will include the Merger).
Employment Letter Agreement with Mr. McKenna
Prometheus previously entered into an employment letter agreement with Mr. McKenna, which governs the terms of his employment with us as our
President and Chief Executive Officer. In the event Prometheus terminates Mr. McKenna without “cause” or he resigns for “good reason” within 24
months following a change in control, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a release of claims and his continued compliance with post-
termination obligations, Mr. McKenna will be entitled to (i) continuation of his base salary for 18 months, (ii) his target bonus, payable in a lump sum, (iii)
payment of the COBRA premiums for him and his eligible dependents for the 18 months following his termination of service, and (iv) accelerated vesting
of any unvested time-based vesting equity awards. In addition, pursuant to his employment letter agreement, Mr. McKenna is also eligible to receive a
gross-up payment for any excise taxes payable under Section 280G and 4999 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) as a
result of a change in control transaction (plus an additional amount necessary to put him in the same after-tax position as if no excise tax had been
imposed).
For purposes of Mr. McKenna’s employment letter agreement, “cause” means his (i) conviction of a felony, plea of guilty or no contest to a felony,
or confession of guilt to a felony; (ii) act or omission which constitutes willful misconduct or gross negligence that results in loss, damage or injury to us
or our prospects, including, but not limited to (a) dishonesty or a breach of fiduciary duty to us or our stockholders, or (b) theft, fraud, embezzlement or
other illegal conduct; (iii) continued failure, refusal or unwillingness to perform, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board determined in good faith, any
material duty or responsibility assigned to him, which failure of performance continues for a period of more than 30 days after written notice thereof has
been provided by our board of directors, setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such failure of performance; or (iv) the material breach of any of
the provisions of his employment letter agreement or any other written agreement between him and us.
For purposes of Mr. McKenna’s employment letter agreement, “good reason” means a resignation that occurs following the occurrence of any of
the following without his written consent: (i) a material change in the geographic location at which he must perform his duties (with a relocation outside a
35-mile radius of his principal place of employment prior to such relocation considered material for this purpose); (ii) a material reduction of his base
compensation, target bonus and/or benefits; (iii) any action or inaction that constitutes a
material breach of his employment letter agreement by us; or (iv) a material reduction in his authority, duties or responsibilities (including a requirement to
report to any person or entity other than the Board, or following a change in control, the board of directors (or similar governing body) of the ultimate
parent company of the surviving entity in such change in control that has at least one class of publicly traded securities listed on a national stock
exchange).

Table of Contents
Employment Letter Agreements with Dr. Marshall and Mr. Stenhouse
Prometheus previously entered into employment letter agreements with each of Dr. Marshall and Mr. Stenhouse, which govern the terms of their
employment with us as our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, respectively. In the event Prometheus terminates Dr. Marshall or Mr.
Stenhouse without “cause” or they resign for “good reason,” Dr. Marshall and Mr. Stenhouse will be entitled to (i) continuation of their base salary for 12
months, (ii) their target bonus, payable in a lump sum, (iii) payment of the COBRA premiums for them and their eligible dependents for the 12 months
following their termination of service, and (iv) accelerated vesting of any unvested time-based vesting equity awards. For purposes of Dr. Marshall and
Mr. Stenhouse’s employment letter agreements, the terms “cause” and, for Dr. Marshall, “good reason” generally have the same meanings as given to
such terms in Mr. McKenna’s employment letter agreement described above, except that for Dr. Marshall, the parenthetical in clause (iv) of the definition
instead reads “(including a requirement to report to any person or entity other than the president and chief executive officer of [Prometheus], or following
a change in control, the chief executive officer of the ultimate parent company of the surviving entity in such change in control that has at least one class
of publicly traded securities listed on a national stock exchange).” For purposes of Mr. Stenhouse’s employment letter agreement “good reason” means a
resignation that occurs following the occurrence of any of the following without his written consent: (i) a material reduction of his base compensation,
target bonus and/or benefits; (ii) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach of his employment letter agreement by us; or (iii) a material
reduction in his authority, duties or responsibilities. Dr. Marshall and Mr. Stenhouse’s entitlement to these severance benefits are subject to their
execution and non-revocation of a release of claims and their continued compliance with post-termination obligations.
2023 Bonus Awards
Those employees of Prometheus (including executive officers) who are eligible to receive an annual cash bonus under an employment letter
agreement or under the Annual Incentive Plan will receive such bonus for the year ending December 31, 2023 at two hundred percent (200%) of the target
level of performance as set forth in the applicable employment letter agreements or the Annual Incentive Plan, as applicable; provided, however, that if an
employee’s employment is terminated prior to the payment of the 2023 bonus awards under circumstances that would give rise to severance under
Prometheus’ Severance Plan, such employee (including executive officers) will be entitled to receive his or her 2023 bonus, prorated for the portion of
2023 that elapsed prior to the date of termination if such termination occurs prior to December 31, 2023. For fiscal year 2023, Mr. McKenna has a target
bonus of 80% of his base salary ($650,000) and each of Dr. Marshall and Mr. Stenhouse has a target bonus of 40% of their base salaries ($480,000).
Transaction and Retention Bonus Pool
The Board has approved a cash transaction and retention bonus pool (the “Retention Pool”) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $10.0 million,
pursuant to which certain employees of Prometheus (including executive officers) may be allocated awards to recognize and reward extraordinary efforts
related to the consummation of the Merger, which will be payable no earlier than the closing of the Merger. As of the date of this proxy statement, no
awards under the Retention Pool have been allocated to any Prometheus employees (including any executive officers).
New Merck Arrangements
Certain of Prometheus’ executive officers may continue to provide employment or other services to Merck after the Effective Time and may enter
into new agreements, arrangements or understandings with Merck to set forth the terms and compensation of such post-Effective Time service. As of the
date of this proxy statement, no such agreements, arrangements or understandings with Merck exist.
280G Mitigation Actions
If the Effective Time is not reasonably anticipated to occur by December 31, 2023, under the Merger Agreement, Prometheus may, in consultation
with Merck, implement strategies before the Effective Time to
 
67
Table of Contents
mitigate the possible impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Pursuant to his employment letter agreement, Mr. McKenna is entitled to receive a
gross-up payment equal to any excise taxes imposed under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (plus any taxes resulting from such additional payment)
as a result of any compensatory payments made to him in connection with a change in control transaction (including the Merger).
Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance
Directors and officers of Prometheus are also entitled to indemnification and covered by insurance in certain circumstances. For a detailed
description of these requirements, please see “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—Indemnification of Directors and Officers;
Insurance” beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement.
Financing of the Merger",74,78
"Prometheus Biosciences, Inc._20230516_DEFM14A_20886960_4667711.Pdf",Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
The Merger Agreement is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Merck. We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to
consummate the Merger and the related transactions, not including fees and expenses, will be approximately $10.8 billion, including the estimated funds
needed to (i) pay our stockholders the Merger Consideration due to them under the Merger Agreement and (ii) make payments in respect of outstanding
equity awards of Prometheus pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
We understand that Merck expects to fund amounts needed for the acquisition of Prometheus under the Merger Agreement through the use of
cash on hand, commercial paper or existing or new credit facilities. Merck and Merger Sub have represented in the Merger Agreement that they have
available or, with respect to Merger Sub, will have available as of the Effective Time, sufficient funds for the satisfaction of all of their obligations under
the Merger Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses required to be paid by Merck or Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement.

"Prometheus Biosciences, Inc._20230516_DEFM14A_20886960_4667711.Pdf",Closing and Effective Time of the Merger,"Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the Merger will take place by electronic exchange of signatures and documents at 9:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified
by the parties, which shall be not later than the second business day after the satisfaction (or waiver, if permitted by applicable law) of the last to be
satisfied of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the closing of the
Merger, but subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permitted by applicable law) of those conditions), and in any event no later than one business day
thereafter, or at such other location, date and time as Prometheus and Merck shall mutually agree upon in writing.
On the Closing Date, Merck, Prometheus and Merger Sub will cause the Merger to be consummated under the DGCL by filing a certificate of merger
in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the DGCL with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and will take such further
actions as may be required to make the Merger effective on the Closing Date. The Merger will become effective at the time and day of the filing of such
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time and day as may be agreed in writing by Prometheus and Merck
and specified in the certificate of merger).
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek appraisal of their Company Shares
under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their Company
Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your Company Shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less
 
68Table of Contents
than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as
“appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be the “fair value” of their Company Shares following petition to, and
an appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their Company Shares
determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the
procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the
provisions of Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to
exercise such rights.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires to
exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting
to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons seek to
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
under the Merger Agreement.
A holder of record of Company Shares and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds or beneficially owns, as applicable, such Company Shares
through the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to the Merger in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise withdrawn, lost or
waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal
of such Company Shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of
the Company Shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement
that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents
to receive notices given by Prometheus and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or
its Company Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Section 262 requires that where a proposed merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation must notify
stockholders that appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20) days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include
either a copy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed
without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes Prometheus’ notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection
with the Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review
the text of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the
loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.
If you elect to demand appraisal of your Company Shares, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: you must deliver to Prometheus a
written demand for appraisal of your Company Shares prior to the
 
69
Table of Contents
Special Meeting, which must (i) reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of record of Company Shares who intends to demand appraisal of his,
her or its Company Shares (and, for beneficial owners only, such demand is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial
ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such
beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Prometheus and to be set forth on the Chancery List) and (ii) that you intend to demand the
appraisal of your shares. In addition, as described above, you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
you must hold or beneficially own, as applicable, your Company Shares continuously through the effective date; and you must comply with the other
applicable requirements of Section 262.
A Prometheus stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail or deliver his, her or its written demand for appraisal to the following
address:
Prometheus Biosciences, Inc.
3050 Science Park Road
San Diego, CA 92121
Attention: Corporate Secretary
Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the Merger has become effective to each
stockholder of any class or series of stock of Prometheus who is entitled to appraisal rights that the Merger was approved and that appraisal rights are
available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation and any person who has properly and
timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of the
Company Shares held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of Prometheus or the surviving corporation to
file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume that Prometheus and the surviving corporation will not file such
a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of Company Shares. Accordingly, persons who desire to have their Company Shares
appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in
Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will
cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.
At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a
named party may withdraw the demand and accept the Merger Consideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person’s Company Shares by
delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more
than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the
person within sixty (60) days after the effective date, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with such approval conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just.
If the surviving corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Delaware Court of
Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the person will be entitled to receive only the fair value of such person’s Company
Shares determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the
Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
In addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions
of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
 
70
Table of Contents
surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of Company Shares not consented in writing or otherwise voted in favor of the
Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the surviving corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such
Company Shares. Such statement must be given within ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or
within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.
Upon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving
corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their Company Shares and with whom the surviving
corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such Company Shares (the “Chancery List”). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving
corporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine which
persons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the
persons who have demanded an appraisal of their Company Shares and who hold Company Shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates
of Company Shares to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any person fails to comply with
such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the Delaware Court of Chancery
may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name
appears on the Chancery List and may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262.
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court of Chancery shall determine the fair
value of Company Shares taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion,
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date
the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the
period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving
corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only on the sum of (x)
the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the Company Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (y)
interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.
When the fair value of the Company Shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest
thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.
Although Prometheus believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and persons should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or
lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger
Consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal

proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of the relevant Company Shares is less than the Merger Consideration.
In determining “fair value”, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value
by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court
has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of
the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of
the merged corporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Delaware Court of Chancery
may consider in determining “fair value” and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction price should be given “considerable weight.”
Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede &
Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of
value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware
Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of
proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys’ and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her
or its attorneys’ and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the
proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all Company Shares entitled to appraisal not
dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.
Determinations by the Delaware Court of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Any person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any purpose any Company Shares
subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such Company Shares, except for dividends or distributions payable
to Prometheus stockholders of record at a date prior to the Effective Time.
To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will
govern.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.",78,82

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to holders of
Company Shares whose Company Shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code,
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable
authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with

holders that hold their Company Shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment
purposes). This summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger. This summary does not describe any of the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax
jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., state, gift or alternative minimum tax, the Medicare
net investment income surtax, or any withholding considerations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including regulations issued
thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith)). In addition, this summary does not address the
U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of Company Shares that exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL. For purposes of this discussion, a
“holder” means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder or both, as the context may require.
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to
holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to:
 
•
holders that may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations,
governmental organizations, S corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as pass-through entities or
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any investor therein, insurance companies, mutual funds, brokers or dealers in stocks,
securities, commodities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies”
or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 
•
holders holding their Company Shares as part of a hedging, straddle or other risk reducing transaction or as part of a conversion transaction
or other integrated investment;
 
•
holders deemed to sell their Company Shares under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;
 
•
holders that received their Company Shares in compensatory transactions;
 
•
holders that hold their Company Shares through individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts;
 
•
holders that own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Merck or the surviving corporation;
 
•
U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 
•
holders that are required to report income no later than when such income is reported in an “applicable financial statement”; or
 
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of the Company Shares (by vote or value).
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of
Company Shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Company Shares and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the particular tax
consequences to them of the Merger.
We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the
following summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any
challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

TAX ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING
UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR OTHER TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this proxy statement, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Company Shares who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 
•
An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 
•
A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or
the District of Columbia;
 
•
An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 
•
A trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons
as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a
United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Company Shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the
amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the Company Shares. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain
or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such Company Shares is more than one year at the time of the consummation of the Merger. A reduced tax
rate on capital gains generally will apply to long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals. There are limitations on the
rate on capital gains generally will apply to long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals. There are limitations on the
deductibility of capital losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Company Shares at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must
determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Company Shares.
Payments made to a U.S. Holder in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and
backup withholding at a rate of 24%. To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. Holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should
complete and return to the exchange agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal certifying that such holder is a United
States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such holder is not subject to
backup withholding. Certain types of U.S. Holders (including, with respect to certain types of payments, corporations) generally are not subject to
backup withholding or information reporting rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger under the backup
withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this proxy statement, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Company Shares that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an
entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
74
Table of Contents
Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences that may be
relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such
gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate specified under an applicable
tax treaty);
 
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition, and
certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate
specified under an applicable tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same
taxable year (if any) provided the Non-U.S. Holder timely files U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses; or
 
•
Company Shares held by such Non-U.S. Holder constitute a United States real property interest (a “USRPI”) by reason of Prometheus’
status as a “United States real property holding corporation” within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code (a “USRPHC”), at any
time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time or the period that the Non-U.S. Holder held the
applicable Company Shares.
With respect to the third bullet point above, Prometheus believes it is not a USRPHC. Because the determination of whether Prometheus is a
USRPHC depends, however, on the fair market value of its USRPIs relative to the fair market value of its non-U.S. real property interests and other
business assets, there can be no assurance Prometheus is not a USRPHC. Even if Prometheus is a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable
disposition of Prometheus common stock by a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if Prometheus common stock is “regularly
traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market and such Non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and
constructively, 5% or less of Prometheus common stock throughout the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable
disposition or the Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period.
Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.
Payments made to Non-U.S. Holders in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS
and backup withholding at a rate of 24%. Non-U.S. Holders generally can avoid information reporting and backup withholding by providing the exchange
agent with the applicable and properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8 certifying the holder’s non-U.S. status or by otherwise establishing an
exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange
agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Merger cannot be consummated until
Prometheus and Merck each file a notification and report form with the
 
75Table of Contents
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period thereunder has
expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period
following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. Prometheus and Merck filed their
respective HSR Act notifications on April 21, 2023. The waiting period under the HSR Act is set to expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 22, 2023.
The DOJ or the FTC may extend the 30 day waiting period by issuing a Request for Additional Information and documentary materials (a “Second
Request”). If either agency issues a Second Request, the waiting period will be extended until 30 days after the parties substantially comply with the
request.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under applicable antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or
hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, and
notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under its applicable antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under applicable antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.
General
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Prometheus, Merck and Merger Sub have agreed to take any and all actions reasonably necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust laws as soon as practicable (and in
any event by the date that is at least five (5) business days before the Effective Time), and to avoid any impediment to the consummation of the Merger
under any antitrust laws, including (1) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, conduct
of business restrictions, a sale or disposition of such assets or businesses as are required to be divested or a license or grant of commercialization rights
to businesses, product lines, fields of use, divisions, business arrangements, contracts, assets or interests therein of Prometheus, (2) amending any
venture or other arrangement of Prometheus and (3) cooperating with each other and using their respective reasonable best efforts to oppose, contest
and resist fully and vigorously any legal proceeding, including by defending through litigation, pursing vigorously all available avenues of administrative
and judicial appeal and seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order that may result from such legal proceedings, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, in each case, as may be required in order to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Termination Date) and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; provided, however, that (x) Merck and its affiliates shall not be obligated to take the foregoing actions
contemplated by this sentence (A) with respect to Merck, its affiliates or their respective assets, categories of assets, businesses, relationships,
contractual rights, obligations or arrangements, and any intellectual property rights thereto or embodied therein or any venture or other arrangement; nor
(B) with respect to Prometheus, to the extent such actions would have any more than an immaterial effect on the business, operations or financial
condition of Prometheus and (y) Prometheus may not take any of the foregoing actions without Merck’s prior written consent. Further, and for the
avoidance of doubt, without the written consent of Prometheus, Merck will not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act (by pull and refile, or
otherwise) or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or any other governmental authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement without the written consent of Prometheus, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

contributions under the ESPP will be used to purchase whole Company Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of such final exercise date,

to receive the Merger Consideration; or (B) after the end of the Final Offering Period, all amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the ESPP

loses or forfeits the right to appraisal of the fair value of such Dissenting Company Shares under Section 262, such Dissenting Company Shares will

Prometheus, for payment to and for the sole benefit of holders of Company Shares pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, cash in an
amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which Prometheus stockholders are entitled under the Merger Agreement (which such amount
does not include the Option Consideration or RSU Consideration).
 
80Table of Contents
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event not later than the third business day thereafter), Merck or the surviving
corporation will cause the paying agent to mail to each person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares
represented by Certificates, which Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to
the Merger Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form reasonably acceptable to Merck and Prometheus, which (A) will specify that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the paying agent, (B) will have a customary
release of all claims against Merck, Merger Sub and Prometheus arising out of or related to such holder’s ownership of Company Shares and (C) will
otherwise be in such form as Merck and the paying agent reasonably agree on and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the forms of which letter of transmittal and instructions are subject
to the reasonable approval of Prometheus prior to the Effective Time.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the paying agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed in
writing by Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of the
Company Shares represented by such Certificates as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for
each such Company Share represented by such Certificate (subject to any required tax withholdings), and any Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be
canceled.
No holder of non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) will be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the
case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, an executed letter of
transmittal to the paying agent, to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will upon the Effective Time, in accordance with
The Depository Trust Company’s customary procedures (including receipt by the paying agent of an “agent’s message” (or such other evidence of
transfer or surrender as the paying agent may reasonably request)) and such other procedures as agreed by Prometheus, Merck, the paying agent and
The Depository Trust Company, be entitled to receive, and Merck will cause the paying agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its
nominee, for the benefit of the holder of such Book-Entry Shares held through it immediately prior to the Effective Time, as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration for each such Book-Entry Share (subject to any required tax
withholdings) and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder will forthwith be canceled.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five business days after the Effective Time), the surviving corporation
will cause the paying agent to mail to each person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held
through The Depository Trust Company (A) a letter of transmittal and (B) instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, the forms of which letter of transmittal and instructions are subject to the reasonable approval of Prometheus prior to the Effective Time.
Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, the holder of such
Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, for each such Book-
Entry Share (subject to any required tax withholdings), and such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered will forthwith be canceled.
Until paid or surrendered as contemplated, each Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Company Shares,
which will be deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, or Canceled
Company Shares.

terms) any material contract or waive, release or assign any material rights or material claims thereunder;
 
•
enter into any contract that by its terms would purport to bind Merck or its affiliates (other than, following the closing of the Merger,
Prometheus);
 
•
unless mandated by any governmental authority, (A) make any material change to, discontinue, terminate or suspend any ongoing research
program relating to a PRA023, PRA052 and PRA578 (and any complementary or companion diagnostics therefor) and any other ongoing
material research program, or (B) commence, alone or with any third party, any research program that has not been disclosed to Merck prior
to the date of the Merger Agreement; or
 
•
offer, agree or commit, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.
In furtherance and not in limitation of any other provision of the Merger Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Prometheus shall
keep Merck informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments (including the occurrence of any serious adverse event and any
material governmental inquiries or investigations), discussions or negotiations relating to the Company Products between or with the FDA or the
European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Prometheus (i) (A)
shall promptly inform Merck, as reasonably in advance as practicable under the circumstances, of any material meetings, filings, submissions or
correspondence to be made by or on behalf of Prometheus between or with the FDA or the EMA relating to any Company Product, and shall provide
Merck with copies of any such filings, submissions or correspondence and (B) shall not carry out or agree to carry out any of the foregoing activities or
communications without prior consultation with Merck, and (ii) (A) shall promptly inform Merck of any material change to any research program protocol,
adding any new research programs, making any material change to a manufacturing plan or process, making any material change to a development
timeline or initiating, or making any material change to any Company Product and (B) shall not carry out or agree to carry out any such change without
prior consultation with Merck.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Merger Agreement is intended to give Merck or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the business or operations of Prometheus at any time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Prometheus shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, complete control and supervision over its business and operations.

Special Meeting and Related Actions
Unless the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Prometheus must, as promptly as practicable after the date of the Merger
Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Prometheus
Stockholder Approval. Prometheus is permitted to postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting if, and only if, (i) Prometheus is unable to obtain a quorum
 
88Table of Contents
of its stockholders at such time, to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to obtain a quorum of its stockholders and Prometheus will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable, (ii) the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that such delay is required by (A) applicable law to comply with comments made by the SEC with respect to this proxy statement or (B) to
allow for the dissemination of any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement that is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable law or
(iii) Prometheus is required to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any legal proceeding commenced after the date of the Merger
Agreement against Prometheus (and/or any of its directors in their capacity as such) by any Prometheus stockholders relating to the Merger Agreement
or transactions contemplated thereby. Except to the extent a Company Board Recommendation Change (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change”
beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement) has been effected, the Board will include the Company Board Recommendation in the proxy statement and
Prometheus will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit votes of the Prometheus stockholders in favor of obtaining Prometheus Stockholder Approval.
Subject to Prometheus’ right to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and to terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Prometheus’ obligations related to the Special Meeting will not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Prometheus or any other person of any Acquisition Proposal or by any event constituting or that could constitute an Intervening
Event.
Access and Information
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and the
Effective Time, Prometheus will (i) afford Merck and its representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of Prometheus (provided, however, that (A) Prometheus may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable law (including any COVID-19 measures) requires Prometheus to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii) granting such access would violate any obligations of Prometheus with respect to confidentiality
to any third party or otherwise breach, contravene or violate, constitute a default under or give a third party the right to terminate or accelerate an
obligation under any then-effective contract to which Prometheus is a party, (iii) access to such documents or information would reasonably be expected
to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information or
(iv) such documents or information relate to the evaluation or negotiation of the Merger Agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby or, subject to
the terms of the Merger Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal, and (B) in each case, access may be limited to the extent Prometheus
reasonably determines, in light of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 measures, that such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of
Prometheus. In the event that Prometheus does not provide access or information in reliance on any of the foregoing provisos in clause (A), it shall use
its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Merck in a way that would not violate any applicable law, contract or obligation
or waive such a privilege and, with respect to access limited in respect of COVID-19 or COVID-19 measures, Prometheus shall use its reasonable best
efforts to communicate the applicable information to Merck in a way that Prometheus reasonably determines would not jeopardize the health and safety
of any Prometheus employee).
Any investigations conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by the Merger Agreement (A) must be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Prometheus or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of Prometheus,
(B) will be subject to Prometheus’ reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and (C) shall not include the right to perform invasive testing
without Prometheus’ prior written consent, in its sole discretion.
The terms and conditions of the confidentiality agreement between Merck and Prometheus apply to any information obtained by Merck or any of
its representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents
Nothing in the Merger Agreement will be construed to require Prometheus or its representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals,
opinions or other information.
No Solicitation; Prometheus Acquisition Proposals; Company Board Recommendation Change
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and the
Effective Time, Prometheus will not, and will cause its directors and officers not to, nor will it authorize or knowingly permit any of its other
representatives to, and will direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
 
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
 
•
furnish to any person (other than Merck, Merger Sub or any designees or representatives of Merck or Merger Sub), or any representative
thereof, any information, or afford to any person (other than Merck, Merger Sub or any designees or representatives of Merck or Merger
Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other information, or to any personnel, of Prometheus or any of its
subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
 
•
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any person, or any representative thereof, with respect to any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (except to notify any person of
Prometheus’ obligations relating to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement);
 
•
enter into any merger agreement, purchase agreement, letter of intent or similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement);
 
•
approve any transaction under, or any third party becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL; or
 
•
approve, authorize, agree or publicly announce any intention to do any of the foregoing.
In addition, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms and
the Effective Time, Prometheus must, and must cause its directors and officers to, and must direct its other representatives to, cease and cause to be
terminated, and must not authorize or knowingly permit any of its other representatives to continue, any and all discussions or negotiations with any
person (other than Merck, Merger Sub and their representatives), or any representative thereof, conducted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement
with respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the limitations in the preceding paragraphs or any other provision in the Merger Agreement, Prometheus and its representatives
may (i) participate in discussions only to the extent necessary to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by any
person solely to determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) inform a person that
has made or is considering making an Acquisition Proposal of Prometheus’ obligations relating to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and the
Effective Time, Prometheus must, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within one business day following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, or
request for information or inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (i) provide Merck with written
notice of such Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry, proposal or offer, and
 
90
Table of Contents
(ii) communicate to Merck the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry, proposal or offer (including
any subsequent amendment thereto) and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry, proposal or offer.
Prometheus must keep Merck reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis with respect to the status of any discussions or negotiations regarding,
and of any changes to the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, request for information or inquiry, proposal or offer, and
must, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one business day of receipt thereof), provide Merck with unredacted copies of all writings or
media containing any material terms or conditions of any such proposals and any proposed transaction agreements (including all schedules, exhibits and
attachments thereto) relating to any such Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry, proposal or offer and any financing commitments relating
thereto.
Notwithstanding the limitations in the preceding paragraphs or any other provision in the Merger Agreement, if at any time prior to the Prometheus
Stockholder Approval, Prometheus or any of its representatives has received a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal from any person or group of
persons that did not result from a material breach of Prometheus’ obligations relating to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement, then if the
Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Prometheus and any of its representatives may enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
with such person or group of persons, engage in discussions to clarify the terms and conditions of, or furnish information with respect to Prometheus to,
the person or group of persons making such Acquisition Proposal (provided that Prometheus must concurrently provide or make available to Merck any
information concerning Prometheus that is provided to such person or group of persons and which was not previously provided or made available to
Merck and Prometheus must have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person or group of persons) and participate and
engage in discussions or negotiations with the person or group of persons making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal.
Within one business day of such determination of the Board, and in any event, prior to or substantially concurrently with Prometheus first taking any of
the actions described in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, Prometheus must provide written notice to Merck
of the determination of the Board (or a committee thereof) relating to such Acquisition Proposal.
Subject to limited exceptions as described herein, neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to Merck or Merger Sub the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) publicly approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the proxy statement when disseminated to Prometheus stockholders, (iv) if any Acquisition Proposal is
structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for the outstanding Company Shares and is commenced pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act
(other than by Merck or an affiliate of Merck), fail to recommend, within ten business days after such commencement, against acceptance by Prometheus
stockholders of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), a
“Company Board Recommendation Change”); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Board or
any committee thereof to Prometheus stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or the taking and disclosure to Prometheus
stockholders of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or any substantially similar communication to either of the foregoing will not be deemed a Company Board Recommendation Change or
prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement (provided that any such disclosure by Prometheus shall state that the Company Board
Recommendation continues to be in effect unless, prior to the time of such public disclosure, a Company Board Recommendation Change has been made
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement).
Notwithstanding the limitations in the preceding paragraphs or any other provision in the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Prometheus Stockholder Approval, the Board (or a committee thereof) may (i) in response to the receipt of a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal
received after the date of
 
91
Table of Contents
the Merger Agreement that did not result from a material breach of Prometheus’ obligations relating to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger
Agreement, or the occurrence of an Intervening Event, effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, or (ii) in response to a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal received after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result in a material breach of Prometheus’ obligations relating to non-
solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such applicable Acquisition Proposal and terminate the
Merger Agreement, provided that (a) the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (b) in the case of receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, that an Intervening Event has occurred, (c)
Prometheus provides written notice to Merck at least three business days prior to effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating
the Merger Agreement of its intent to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor (a “Change of Recommendation Notice”), (d) prior to effecting
such Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating the Merger Agreement, Prometheus must, and must cause its representatives to, be
reasonably available to negotiate with Merck in good faith (to the extent Merck desires to negotiate) during such three business day period to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as would obviate the basis for a Company Board Recommendation Change or the
termination of the Merger Agreement and (e) no earlier than the end of such three business day period, the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, after considering any amendments to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement proposed by Merck in a binding written offer irrevocably made by Merck during such three business day period, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law (and, in the case of receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal). Following delivery of a Change of Recommendation
Notice in the case of a Superior Proposal, in the event of any change to the financial terms (including any change to the amount or form of consideration
payable) or other revision to the terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, Prometheus must provide a new Change of Recommendation Notice
to Merck, and any Company Board Recommendation Change or termination of the Merger Agreement following delivery of such new Change of
Recommendation Notice must again be subject to clause (c) and clause (d) of the immediately preceding sentence for a period of two business days.
Notwithstanding the limitations in the preceding paragraphs or any other provision in the Merger Agreement, nothing in the Merger Agreement
prohibits Prometheus or the Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to Prometheus stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to
Prometheus stockholders if the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure
to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Prometheus stockholders under applicable law,
provided that any such disclosure by Prometheus states that the Company Board Recommendation continues to be in effect unless, prior to the time of
such public disclosure, a Company Board Recommendation Change has been made in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement:
 
•
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means any confidentiality agreement containing provisions limiting the disclosure and use of non-
public information of or with respect to Prometheus that (i) contains confidentiality provisions that are not, in the aggregate, materially less
favorable to Prometheus than the terms of the confidentiality agreement Prometheus entered into with an affiliate of Merck, and does not
contain any exclusivity provision or other term that would restrict, in any manner, Prometheus’ ability to comply with the terms of the
Merger Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill provisions that would restrict
 
92
Table of Contents
the making of or amendment or modification to Acquisition Proposals, or (ii) was entered into prior to the date of the Merger Agreement.
 
•
“Acquisition Proposal” means any indication of interest, offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Merck or Merger Sub) to
engage in an Acquisition Transaction.
 
•
“Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement) resulting in: (a) any acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder) of more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of Prometheus or any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person or group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) beneficially owning more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of Prometheus; (b) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar transaction involving Prometheus (i) pursuant to which any person or “group”
(as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Prometheus stockholders (as a group) immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction, would hold Company Shares representing more than 25% of the voting power of the surviving entity or
(ii) as a result of which Prometheus stockholders (as a group) immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction would hold
Company Shares representing less than 75% of the voting power of the surviving entity after giving effect to the consummation of such
transaction; (c) any sale, license or disposition of tangible or intangible assets or businesses that constitute or represent more than 25% of
the total revenue, net income, EBITDA or total assets (measured on a fair market value basis as of the date thereof) of Prometheus; or (d)
any liquidation or dissolution of Prometheus; provided, however, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby shall not be
deemed an Acquisition Transaction in any case.
 
•
“Intervening Event” means an effect that (a) was not known to the Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement or, if known, the material
consequences of which were not reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (b) does not relate to an
Acquisition Proposal, provided that in no event shall any change in the price or trading volume of Company Shares or any other securities
of Prometheus constitute an Intervening Event (provided that the underlying cause of such changes may constitute or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been an Intervening Event).
 
•
“Superior Proposal” means a written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of Prometheus’ obligations
relating to non-solicitation as set forth in the Merger Agreement for a transaction or series of related transactions contemplated by clauses
(a), (b) or (c) of the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” on terms that the Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory, timing and other
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, to be more favorable to Prometheus stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the Merger
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Merck in response to such proposal); provided, however, that for
purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition Proposal” in this definition of a “Superior Proposal,” all references to (a) “more than 25%” in
the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” shall be deemed to be references to “a majority” and (b) “less than 75%” shall be deemed to be
references to “less than a majority.”
The Merger Agreement provides that nothing will prevent Prometheus from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) issuing “stop, look and listen” communications or similar
communications of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. However, the Board may only make an Adverse Recommendation
Change as otherwise permitted in the Merger Agreement.

Employee Matters
For the 18-month period following the Effective Time, Merck will provide, or will cause the surviving corporation to provide, to each continuing
employee (during such employee’s employment) with:
 
•
base salary or base wages and an annual target cash bonus opportunity (excluding retention and change in control bonuses) that, in each
case, is no less than those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
 
•
severance pay no less favorable than the severance benefits provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
and
 
•
other benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those offered by Prometheus to the continuing employees as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any equity or equity-based and change in control or transaction-based compensation or
benefits or post-employment health or welfare benefits).
With respect to certain employee benefit plans maintained by Merck or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, in which any continuing employee will
participate on or after the Effective Time, Merck is required to, and to cause the surviving corporation to, recognize all service with Prometheus rendered
prior to the Effective Time by such continuing employee for purposes of vesting, eligibility and entitlement to benefits under the terms of such employee
benefit plan. However, Merck is not required to recognize service with Prometheus rendered prior to the Effective Time for purposes of benefit accrual
(other than for purposes of severance or vacation) or to the extent that doing so would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition, Merck is required
to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) ensure that each continuing employee is immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
Merck employee benefit plan, compensation plan, or severance arrangement to the extent the Merck plans replace coverage under a comparable
Prometheus plan in which such continuing employee participates immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) waive, or cause to be waived, all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, and actively-at-work or similar requirements to the same extent such
limitations are waived under any comparable plan of Prometheus applicable to such continuing employee prior to the Effective Time, (iii) recognize, for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by a continuing
employee in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, and (iv) ensure that the accounts of such continuing employees under any new Merck
plan that is a flexible spending plan are credited with any unused balance in the account of such continuing employee under the prior Prometheus plan.
Prior to the Effective Time, Prometheus will take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to terminate Prometheus’ equity incentive plans,
effective as of, and contingent upon, the closing of the Merger.
Efforts to Consummate the Merger
Each of Prometheus and Merck must use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including (i) to cause the conditions to the other party’s obligation to
close to be satisfied as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (ii) subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, obtaining, as promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and maintaining all necessary actions or non-actions and consents from governmental authorities and
making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with governmental authorities, that are necessary to consummate the Merger, (iii) resisting,
contesting, appealing and removing any legal proceeding and vacating, lifting, reversing or overturning any order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, restricts or restrains the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and (iv) upon writing request of Merck and Merger Sub, obtaining all necessary or appropriate consents under material contracts to which
Prometheus is a party in connection with the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and (v) reasonably
cooperate with the other party or parties with respect to any of the foregoing.
 
94
Table of Contents
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Prometheus, Merck and Merger Sub have agreed to take any and all actions reasonably necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust laws as soon as practicable (and in
any event by the date that is at least five (5) business days before the Effective Time), and to avoid any impediment to the consummation of the Merger
under any antitrust laws, including (1) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, conduct
of business restrictions, a sale or disposition of such assets or businesses as are required to be divested or a license or grant of commercialization rights
to businesses, product lines, fields of use, divisions, business arrangements, contracts, assets or interests therein of Prometheus, (2) amending any
venture or other arrangement of Prometheus and (3) cooperating with each other and using their respective reasonable best efforts to oppose, contest
and resist fully and vigorously any legal proceeding, including by defending through litigation, pursing vigorously all available avenues of administrative
and judicial appeal and seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order that may result from such legal proceedings, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, in each case, as may be required in order to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Termination Date) and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; provided, however, that (x) Merck and its affiliates shall not be obligated to take the foregoing actions
contemplated by this sentence (A) with respect to Merck, its affiliates or their respective assets, categories of assets, businesses, relationships,
contractual rights, obligations or arrangements, and any intellectual property rights thereto or embodied therein or any venture or other arrangement; nor
(B) with respect to Prometheus, to the extent such actions would have any more than an immaterial effect on the business, operations or financial
condition of Prometheus and (y) Prometheus may not take any of the foregoing actions without Merck’s prior written consent. Further, and for the
avoidance of doubt, without the written consent of Prometheus, Merck will not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act (by pull and refile, or
otherwise) or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or any other governmental authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement without the written consent of Prometheus, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of Merck and Prometheus must (among other things) (i) keep the other party reasonably apprised
with respect to any substantive oral communications with any governmental authority regarding the Merger and cooperate in the filing of any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other written communications explaining or defending the Merger, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument and/or responding to requests or objections made by any governmental authority, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any
substantive communication from any governmental regarding any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in connection with any
filings or investigations with, by or before any governmental authority relating to the Merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
including any proceedings initiated by a private party, and (iii) provide the other party a reasonable advance opportunity to review all written
communication with a governmental authority regarding the Merger, and give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such substantive
meetings and substantive conference calls.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance
Merck and the surviving corporation must (and Merck is required to cause the surviving corporation to) (i) honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of Prometheus under (a) certain indemnification agreements entered into between Prometheus, on the one hand, and any of its current and
former officers and directors and any person who becomes a director or officer of Prometheus, on the other hand and (b) certain indemnification
agreements entered into between Prometheus or any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise,
on the one hand, and any person serving or who served as a director,
 
95
Table of Contents
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of any of the foregoing at the request of Prometheus, in each case, prior to the Effective Time, on the other hand ((a)
and (b) collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”), and (c) the indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any threatened or actual action, suit, claim, proceeding, investigation, arbitration or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each an “Indemnified Proceeding”) to the extent such Indemnified Proceeding arises directly or indirectly
out of or pertains or relates directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent of Prometheus or other affiliates (including as a fiduciary with respect to any employment benefit plan) or by reason of
the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of Prometheus or its affiliates or at the request of
Prometheus as such (including as a fiduciary with respect to any employee benefit plan) of another person (regardless, in each case, of whether such
action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or (iii) the enforcement of any of the rights of such Indemnified Person (or his or her heirs or legal representatives) under the Merger
Agreement. In addition, for six years after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation is required to (and Merck shall cause the surviving corporation to)
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than the corresponding provisions in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company as of the date of the Merger Agreement, and during such six-year period, such provisions cannot be repealed, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner adverse to such Indemnified Persons, except as required by applicable law.
For six years after the Effective Time and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Merck and the surviving corporation shall (and Merck
shall cause the surviving corporation to) advance, prior to the final disposition of any Indemnified Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought
under the Merger Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’

undertaking by such Indemnified Person, to the extent required by law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification under the Merger Agreement.
For six years after the Effective Time, Merck is required to, and shall cause the surviving corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the directors and
officers of Prometheus, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (“D&O Insurance”) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event provides coverage not
less favorable to the insured persons than. Prometheus’ equivalent insurance policies in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement. However, in no
event will the surviving corporation be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium amount
paid by Prometheus prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by Prometheus prior to the Effective Time. The surviving corporation will (and Merck shall cause the
surviving corporation to) maintain the D&O Insurance “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder
for six years after the Effective Time.
If any Indemnified Person notifies the surviving corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) has been made against such Indemnified Person, the indemnification
provisions of the Merger

Agreement shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
In the event that Merck or the surviving corporation (or any of its successor or assigns) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is
not the continuing entity of such consolidation or merger, or engages in any division transaction or transfers, coneys or otherwise disposes of all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Merck and the surviving corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in the indemnification section of the Merger Agreement.

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Prometheus is required to submit a proposal to
Prometheus stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive
officers of Prometheus that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. This
compensation is summarized in the table set forth below, including the footnotes to the table. This proposal is commonly known as a “say-on-golden
parachute proposal,” and we refer to it as the “Merger Compensation Proposal.”
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information
about compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, assuming
the Merger is consummated on the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy statement, May 9, 2023.
Please note that the amounts indicated below are estimates based on the material assumptions described in the assumptions and notes to the table
below, which may or may not actually occur. Some of these assumptions are based on information currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts,
if any, that may become payable to a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. For purposes of this
disclosure, “single-trigger” refers to payments and benefits that arise solely as a result of the completion of the Merger and “double-trigger” refers to
payments and benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and a qualifying termination of employment.
Furthermore, for purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed:
 
•
a Closing Date of May 9, 2023 (which is the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy statement);
 
•
the employment of each named executive officer is terminated by Prometheus without “cause” or by the named executive officer for “good
reason” (each, a “qualifying termination”), in either case, immediately following the consummation of the Merger;
 
•
the named executive officer’s base salary and target bonus will remain unchanged from those applicable as of May 9, 2023, which target
bonus amount is 80% of base salary, in the case of Mr. McKenna, and 40% of base salary for the other named executive officers;
 
•
each named executive officer’s outstanding Prometheus equity awards are those that are outstanding and unvested as of May 9, 2023;
 
•
each named executive officer will receive reimbursement or payment of COBRA premiums, as applicable, for the maximum eligible period;
 
•
a price per Company Share equal to the Merger Consideration of $200.00;
 
•
no portion of the Retention Pool has been allocated to any of the named executive officers as of May 9, 2023; and
 
•
no reduction will be necessary to mitigate the impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Amounts in this column reflect cash severance that each named executive officer would be eligible to receive under their respective employment
letter agreements, plus a prorated 2023 bonus payout.
Under the employment letter agreement with Mr. McKenna, if Mr. McKenna experiences a qualifying termination within 24 months following a
change in control, Mr. McKenna would be entitled to (i) continuation of his base salary for 18 months and (ii) his target bonus, payable in a lump
sum. These cash payments are “double-trigger” benefits in that they will only be paid following the Merger if Mr. McKenna experiences a
qualifying termination of employment during the period described above.
Under the employment letter agreements with Dr. Marshall and Mr. Stenhouse, if Prometheus terminates Dr. Marshall or Mr. Stenhouse without
cause or they resign for good reason, Dr. Marshall and Mr. Stenhouse would be entitled to (i) continuation of their base salary for 12 months, and
(ii) their target bonus, payable in a lump sum. These cash payments are “double-trigger” benefits in that they will only be paid following the Merger
if Dr. Marshall and Mr. Stenhouse experience a qualifying termination of employment.
If a named executive officer is terminated prior to the payment of his fiscal year 2023 bonus under circumstances that would give rise to severance
under such named executive officer’s employment letter agreement, then such named executive officer will receive a bonus for fiscal year 2023 at
two hundred percent (200%) of the target level of performance; provided, however, if such named executive officer’s employment is terminated
prior to December 31, 2023, such bonus payout will be prorated based on the portion of 2023 that elapsed prior to their date of termination. The
payment of any such prorated bonus is in addition to the severance under his employment letter agreement, as described above. The named
executive officers are eligible to receive a fiscal year 2023 bonus irrespective of the occurrence of a change in control, but the accelerated pro-rated
portion of the 200% of target payout level reflected in the table above can be considered a “double-trigger” benefit in that such acceleration only
becomes due if the named executive officers experience a qualifying termination of employment prior to the payment of the fiscal year 2023 bonus
awards.
The receipt of the cash severance and 2023 bonus payments described above are subject to the named executive officers’ execution and non-
revocation of a general release of claims in favor of Prometheus and continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants.

This table does not include any allocable portion of the Retention Pool which may be allocated to all or some of the Prometheus named executive

As described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on page 79 of this proxy
statement, amounts in this column reflect the value of Prometheus stock options and RSUs held by each named executive officer that would
accelerate upon the Closing.
This table does not include any outstanding rights to purchase Company Shares under the ESPP held by our named executive officers. For
additional information regarding the ESPP, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards and the ESPP” beginning on page 79 of this

Given that all outstanding equity awards held by the named executive officers as of May 9, 2023 will accelerate at the closing of the Merger without
regard to any termination of employment, the amounts listed in the columns entitled “Value of Accelerated Stock Options” and “Value of

Amounts in this column represent the cost of COBRA continuation coverage for a period of 18 months (in the case of Mr. McKenna) or 12 months
(for the other named executive officers) following the date of termination. The amount is based upon the type of insurance coverage the Company
carried for each named executive officer as of May 9, 2023 and is valued at the premiums in effect on such date. These COBRA continuation
coverage payments are “double-trigger” benefits in that they will only be paid following the Merger if the named executive officer experiences a
qualifying termination of employment.
 
(4)
Amount in this column represents the estimated tax gross-up payment payable to Mr. McKenna pursuant to his employment letter agreement,
based on the assumptions noted above and taking into account any and all applicable federal, state, and local excise, income, or other taxes that
would be payable on such gross-up payment at the highest applicable rates. The portion of such tax gross-up payment related solely to the equity
award acceleration ($24,582,163) is a “single-trigger” benefit that will be received solely because of the Merger and regardless of whether Mr.
McKenna’s employment is terminated. The portions of any tax gross-up payment related to Mr. McKenna’s severance payments, 2023 pro-rated
bonus and subsidized COBRA continuation coverage ($1,457,132) are a “double-trigger” benefit in that they will only be paid following the Merger
if Mr. McKenna experiences a qualifying termination of employment in accordance with his employment letter agreement. The estimates of “excess
parachute payments” for purposes of this calculation do not take into account any mitigation for payments which could be shown (under the facts
and circumstances) not to be contingent on a change in control or for any payments deemed to be reasonable compensation.
Vote Required
The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Prometheus approve the following resolution:
“BE IT RESOLVED THAT: 
the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Prometheus’ named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the section entitled “Proposal No. 2: Advisory Vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal
—The Merger Compensation Proposal—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Prometheus’ Named Executive Officers”
beginning on page 105 of the proxy statement dated May 16, 2023, including the tables, associated footnotes and narrative discussion, is
hereby approved, ratified and confirmed on a non-binding, advisory basis.”

Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast
affirmatively or negatively (excluding abstentions) at the Special Meeting by the holders entitled to vote thereon. Each Company Share issued and
outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Special Meeting. If a stockholder signs and returns a proxy and
does not indicate how he, she or it wishes to vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal, such stockholder’s Company Shares will be voted in favor of
the Merger Compensation Proposal. If a Prometheus stockholder abstains from voting, it will not be considered to be a vote cast on the Merger
Compensation Proposal and will have no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal. If a Prometheus stockholder fails to vote, it will have no effect on
the Merger Compensation Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the Merger Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to
approve the Merger Proposal and vote against or abstain with respect to the Merger Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the
Merger Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Prometheus or Merck. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved
and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-
binding, advisory vote of Prometheus’ stockholders on the Merger Compensation Proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting, which we refer to as the “Adjournment
Proposal.” If our stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies, including the
solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against the Merger Proposal. Among other
things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the
Merger Proposal such that the Merger Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Proposal and
seek to convince the holders of those Company Shares to change their votes to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. In addition, the chairperson of the
Special Meeting could adjourn the Special Meeting if under our amended and restated bylaws a quorum is not present for the meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Prometheus’ right to adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting, and the number of times that Prometheus may
adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting, and the duration of any such adjournment or postponement, is subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement
as described further under “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—Special Meeting and Related Actions” beginning on page 88 of
this proxy statement.
If the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to
revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as adjourned or postponed. Prometheus does not intend to call a vote on the
Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of Prometheus and our stockholders to be able to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies in respect of the Merger Proposal if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the
Special Meeting.
Vote Required
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast affirmatively or
negatively (excluding abstentions) at the Special Meeting by the holders entitled to vote thereon. Each Company Share issued and outstanding as of the

Adjournment Proposal. If a Prometheus stockholder fails to vote, it will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have
no effect on the Adjournment Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve
the Merger Proposal and vote against or abstain with respect to the Adjournment Proposal and vice versa.

Upon the consummation of the Merger, there will be no further market for Company Shares and, as promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company

The following table and accompanying footnotes set forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company Shares on

each of our named executive officers;

Company Shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be issued and outstanding all Company
Shares subject to options, warrants or other rights held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable within 60 days of May 9, 2023. We did not
deem these shares issued and outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise

If the Merger is consummated, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of our
stockholders. However, if the Merger is not consummated, our stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in meetings of our
stockholders.
We intend to hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2023 only if the Merger is not consummated.
Stockholders who intend to have a proposal considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for presentation at our annual meeting of stockholders
to be held in 2023 pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must have submitted the proposal to our Secretary at our offices at 3050 Science Park
Road, San Diego, California 92121 in writing not later than December 2, 2022, which is 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the mailing date of
Prometheus’ proxy statement for its annual meeting of stockholders held on May 19, 2022, unless the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders is
changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary of our 2022 annual meeting, in which case the deadline for such proposals will be a reasonable time
before we begin to print and send our proxy materials. These proposals must comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the
SEC in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act for such proposals to be included in the proxy statement.
Stockholders intending to present a proposal at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, but not to include the proposal in our proxy statement, or
to nominate a person for election as a director, must comply with the requirements set forth in our amended and restated bylaws. Our amended and
restated bylaws require, among other things, that our Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the stockholder of record of their intent to present
such proposal or nomination not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the
anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. Therefore, we must have received notice of such a proposal or nomination for the 2023 annual
meeting of stockholders no earlier than the close of business on January 19, 2023 and no later than the close of business on February 18, 2023. The notice
must contain the information required by the amended and restated bylaws, a copy of which is available upon request to our Corporate Secretary. In the
event that the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the one-year anniversary of our
2022 annual meeting of stockholders, then our Corporate Secretary must receive such written notice not earlier than the close of business on the 120th
day prior to the 2023 annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the 2023 annual meeting and the 10th day following
the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made by us. SEC rules permit management to vote proxies in its discretion in certain
cases if the stockholder does not comply with this deadline and, in certain other cases, notwithstanding the stockholder’s compliance with this deadline.
Stockholders are advised to review our amended and restated bylaws which also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s
notice.
In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under our amended and restated bylaws, to comply with the universal proxy rules,
stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than Prometheus’ nominees must have provided notice that sets forth the
information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than March 20, 2023, which is 60 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the
preceding year’s annual meeting, unless the date of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders changes by more than 30 days from the anniversary of the
2022 annual meeting of stockholders, in which case, notice must be provided by the later of 60 days prior to the date of the 2023 annual meeting of
stockholders or the 10th day following the date on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made by us.
We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these or
other applicable requirements.

The Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of Prometheus Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
“Company”), of the $200.00 per Share in cash, without interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger
proposed to be entered into (the “Agreement”) by and among Merck & Co., Inc., a New Jersey corporation (“Parent”), Splash Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company. The Agreement provides that Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the “Transaction”), as a
result of which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger (other than any Shares (i) held by the Company as treasury stock, (ii) owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger
Sub, in each case as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, or (iii) the Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in the Agreement) (the
Shares referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together with any Shares held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent, the “Excluded Shares”)) will be
converted into the right to receive $200.00 per Share in cash, without interest, (the $200.00 per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the
“Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our
services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we advise the Board of
Directors of the Company that we are prepared to render this opinion and (ii) the rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us
against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and
merchant banking activities. In the past two years, except for our current engagement, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other
services to the Company, and we have not received any compensation from the Company during such period. In the past two years, we have provided
financial advisory services unrelated to the Company, to Parent, including in connection with Parent’s spin-off of Organon & Co. in 2021 and other
strategic matters, and we have received compensation from Parent during such period. We may provide financial advisory and other services to or with
respect to the Company or Parent or their respective affiliates in the future, for which we may receive compensation. Certain (i) of our and our affiliates’
directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of our affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds
or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade,
in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company,
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement dated April 15, 2023 (the “Draft Agreement”);
(ii) Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021; (iii) certain interim reports to
stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; (iv) certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; (v) certain
other communications from the Company to its stockholders; and (vi) certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash
flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the Company, including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to the Company prepared by
management of the Company and furnished to us by the Company for purposes of our analysis (the “Forecasts”) (collectively, the “Internal Data”). We
have also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of the Company regarding their assessment of the
Internal Data. In addition, we reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data for the Company. We also compared certain of the proposed
financial terms of the Transaction with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant and
conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as we deemed appropriate.
We have assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal, regulatory,
tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by us for purposes of this opinion and have, with your consent, relied
upon such information as being complete and accurate. In that regard, we have assumed, at your direction, that the Internal Data (including, without
limitation, the Forecasts) has been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
the Company as to the matters covered thereby and we have relied, at your direction, on the Internal Data for purposes of our analysis and this opinion.
We express no view or opinion as to the Internal Data or the assumptions on which it is based. In addition, at your direction, we have not made any
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company and we
have not been asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of the Company. We have assumed, at your
direction, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any respect material to our analysis or this opinion from the Draft Agreement reviewed by us.
We have also assumed, at your direction, that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement and in accordance with all
applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or
agreement, the effect of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental,
regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction, condition or other change will be
imposed, the effect of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion. We have not evaluated and do not express any opinion as to the solvency
or fair value of the Company, or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations when they come due, or as to the impact of the Transaction on such
matters, under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
advisors, and we express no opinion as to any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
We express no view as to, and our opinion does not address, the Company’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the
Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the
Company or in which the Company might engage. This opinion is limited to and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date
hereof, to the holders of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We have
not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or the Transaction,
including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the Agreement or
entered

into in connection with or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of the Transaction or any other term or
aspect of the Transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or any other party. In addition, we express no view or opinion as to the fairness
(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees
of the Company or any party, or class of such persons in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders
of the Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, currency, market and other
conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof, and we do not have any obligation or
responsibility to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our opinion
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote
with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.
Our financial advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the
Company (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes of its consideration of the Transaction. The
issuance of this opinion was approved by the Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion Committee.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications
and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that the Consideration to be paid to the holders of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

(a) Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:
(i) Company Shares. Each Company Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (A)
Canceled Company Shares, and (B) any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to $200.00 (the “Merger Consideration”), without interest thereon and subject to any applicable withholding Tax
pursuant to Section 2.8(e), upon compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.8 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in Section 2.10).
(ii) Excluded Company Shares. Each Company Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Canceled Company Shares”),
shall be canceled and extinguished, without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor, at the Effective Time.

Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of common stock of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
 
A-14Table of Contents
(b) Adjustment to the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time occurring on or
after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding equity interests of the Company shall occur as a result of any
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Shares) with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items (including the Option Consideration and the RSU
Consideration), as the case may be, will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and provide the holders of each Company Share, Company Option
and Company RSU Award the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.
(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all Company Shares that are issued and outstanding and
held by Company Stockholders (or held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of a beneficial owner who beneficially owns such Company Shares) as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time who are entitled to demand and who shall have properly and validly demanded their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such Company Shares in compliance in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, “Dissenting Company Shares”) shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7(a), but instead such Person will be entitled to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Person in respect of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders (or beneficially owned by a beneficial owner that made an appraisal demand
with respect thereto) who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost or forfeited their rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, and subject to any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to Section 2.8(e), upon the terms and conditions hereof,
including the surrender of the certificate or certificates evidencing such Company Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.8 (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in Section 2.10).
(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company
Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section 2.7(c)(ii), “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of the
proposed material strategy and other material decisions with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not (or could not reasonably be
expected to be) undermined or otherwise affected in any respect), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands (which
may be rejected in the sole discretion of the Company) but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such demands except
for the payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth above.
(d) Company Options. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto, whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent or the holder thereof, be canceled and terminated and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in
 
A-15
Table of Contents
cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) an amount equal to (A) the Merger Consideration, less (B) the per share exercise price of such
Company Option (the “Option Consideration”) (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to the Surviving
Corporation by the holder of a Company Option), subject to any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 2.8(e); provided, however, that any
such Company Option with respect to which the applicable per share exercise price of such Company Option is greater than the Merger Consideration
shall be canceled without consideration therefor. On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each of the holders of Company Options
the applicable Option Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 2.8(e)) as promptly as practicable (and in no event
later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date at least five Business Days after the Closing) thereafter.
(e) Company RSU Awards. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding
immediately prior thereto shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof, be
canceled and terminated and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, by
(y) the Merger Consideration (the “RSU Consideration”), subject to any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 2.8(e). Parent shall pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay to each holder of Company RSU Awards the applicable RSU Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to
Section 2.8(e)) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date at least five Business Days after the
Closing) after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU
Award that, immediately prior to such cancellation, constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made
on the applicable settlement date for such Company RSU Award if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
(f) Company Restricted Shares. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share that is outstanding
immediately prior thereto shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof, be
automatically fully vested and, at the Effective Time, shall be treated the same as all other Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.7(a).
(g) Company ESPP. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, the committee administering the Company ESPP) will pass such resolutions and
take all actions reasonably necessary with respect to the Company ESPP to provide that (i) except for the offering periods under the Company ESPP in
effect on the date hereof (the “Final Offering Periods”), no new offering period will commence following the date hereof unless and until this Agreement
is terminated; and (ii) from and after the date hereof, no new participants will be permitted to participate in the Company ESPP and participants will not be
permitted to increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on date of this Agreement. If the Effective Time occurs: (i) during
one or more of the Final Offering Periods, (A) the final exercise date(s) under the Company ESPP shall be such date as the Company determines in its sole
discretion (provided that such date shall be no later than the date that is five (5) days prior to the Effective Time) (the “Final Exercise Date”), and (B) each
Company ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase whole Company Shares in accordance with
the terms of the Company ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date, which Company Shares, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.7(a); or (ii) after the end
of both of the Final Offering Periods, all amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the Company ESPP at the end of each of the Final Offering
Periods shall thereupon be used to purchase whole Company Shares under the terms of the Company ESPP for such offering period, which Company
Shares, to the extent
 
A-16

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.7(a). As promptly as practicable following the purchase of Company Shares in accordance with the foregoing clauses (i) or
(ii), the Company shall return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall designate and appoint a nationally recognized, reputable U.S.
bank or trust company (the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Company)
to act as the paying agent for the Company Stockholders entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II (the “Paying Agent”).
(b) Exchange Fund. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, for payment to and for
the sole benefit of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to
which Company Stockholders are entitled under this Article II (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Option Consideration or RSU
Consideration) (such cash amount being referred to herein as the “Exchange Fund”). Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section
2.8(g). No investment or losses thereon shall affect the consideration to which holders of Company Shares are entitled under this Article II and to the
extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
amount required to promptly pay in full the cash amounts contemplated by this Article II, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make in
full such payments contemplated this Article II. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as expressly provided in this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, in its sole discretion, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Company Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that, unless otherwise agreed
by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or any
agency or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Earnings from such investments shall be the sole
and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Shares as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Payment Procedures.
(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Company Shares represented by certificates (the “Certificates”), which Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in a customary form reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall have a customary release of all claims against Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
arising out of or related to such holder’s ownership of Company Shares and shall otherwise be in such
 
A-17Table of Contents
form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree upon (a “Letter of Transmittal”) and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and
instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed in writing by Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of the Company Shares represented by such Certificates as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Company Share formerly represented by such
Certificates (subject to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.8(e)), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be
a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any Transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates representing any Dissenting Company
Shares, which shall represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, or any Canceled Company Shares.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through
The Depository Trust Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent, to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms hereof. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry
Shares held through The Depository Trust Company immediately prior to the Effective Time whose Company Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall upon the Effective Time, in accordance with The Depository Trust Company’s customary procedures (including
receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” (or such other evidence of transfer or surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request)) and
such other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent and The Depository Trust Company, be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, for the benefit of the holder of such Book-Entry Shares held
through it immediately prior to the Effective Time, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the
Merger Consideration for each such Book-Entry Share (subject to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.8(e)) and such Book-Entry
Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company (A) a Letter of Transmittal and (B) instructions for returning such
Letter of Transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon delivery of such Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such Letter
of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, for each such Book-Entry Share (subject to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.8(e)),
and such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered immediately prior to the Effective Time. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
 
A-18
Table of Contents
Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Company Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, or Canceled Company Shares.
(d) Transfers of Ownership. In the event that a transfer of ownership of Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment
has paid any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name such
Certificate is registered or the registered holder of such Book-Entry Shares, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.
(e) Required Withholding. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation (each, a “Payor”) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Shares, Company Options,
Company Restricted Shares and Company RSU Awards such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws;
provided, however, that except for payments to current or former employees of the Company with respect to Company Options and Company RSU
Awards or other compensatory payments, before making any such deduction or withholding, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
to the Company written notice of any applicable Payor’s intention to make such deduction or withholding and such notice shall include the authority,
basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding and shall be given at least ten (10) days before such deduction or withholding
is required in order for the Company to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding from the applicable Governmental Authority
and/or execute and deliver to or file with such Governmental Authority and/or Parent such affidavits, certificates and other documents as may reasonably
be expected to afford to the Company and its stockholders reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. Parent shall reasonably cooperate
with the Company to obtain such reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted and
withheld, each such Payor shall take all action as may be necessary to ensure any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority. Any amounts deducted and withheld under this Agreement that are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.
(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or other amounts earned with
respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and any Company Stockholders who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates that represented Company Shares or
Book-Entry Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.8(g)
shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or
such Book-Entry Shares solely to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration
to which such Company Stockholders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

Proposal promptly return to the Company or destroy all non-public documents and materials containing non-public information of the Company that has
been furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such Person pursuant to the terms of such confidentiality agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may (A) participate in discussions only to the extent
necessary to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by any Person solely to determine whether such inquiry or
proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) inform a Person that has made or is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal of the provisions of this Section 5.2.
(b) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective

(1) Business Day of receipt thereof), provide Parent with unredacted copies of all writings or media containing any material terms or conditions of any
such proposals and any proposed transaction agreements (including all schedules, exhibits and attachments thereto) relating to any such Acquisition
Proposal, request for information, inquiry, proposal or offer and any financing commitments relating thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, all information
provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) below would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company and any of its Representatives may (A) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
with such Person or group of Persons, (B) engage in discussions to clarify the terms and conditions of, or furnish information with respect to the
Company to, the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal (provided that (x) the Company shall concurrently provide or make

terminate, or waive, release or assign, any provisions of any confidentiality or explicit or implicit standstill obligations (or any similar agreement) to which
the Company is a party relating to any possible Acquisition Proposal and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend or otherwise modify, waive or fail to enforce, on a
confidential and non-public basis, any provision of any confidentiality, “standstill” or similar agreement solely to the extent that such provision prohibits
or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company Board if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of any such release or waiver promptly following, but in any event
within one (1) Business Day of, such release or waiver.

communication by the Company Board or any committee thereof to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, any action
contemplated by Section 5.3(c)(i) or any substantially similar communication to either of the foregoing, shall not be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change or otherwise be prohibited under the terms of this Agreement, provided that any such disclosure by the Company shall state
that the Company Board Recommendation continues to be in effect unless, prior to the time of such public disclosure, a Company Board
Recommendation Change has been made in compliance with this Section 5.3.

Approval, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may (i) in response to the receipt of (x) a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal received after the
date hereof that did not result from a material breach of Section 5.2, or (y) the occurrence of an Intervening Event, effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change, or (ii) in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal received after the date hereof that did not result from a material
breach of Section 5.2(b), enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such applicable Acquisition Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii), provided that (A) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) in the case of
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor(s)
and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, that an Intervening
Event has occurred, (C) the Company provides written notice to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to effecting a Company Board
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) of its intent to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor (a
“Change of Recommendation Notice”), (D) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, be reasonably available to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
obviate the basis for a Company Board Recommendation Change or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), and (E) no earlier
than the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board

amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in a binding written offer irrevocably made by Parent during such three
(3) Business Day period, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(and, in the case of receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal). Following delivery
of a Change of Recommendation Notice in the case of a Superior Proposal, in the event of any change to the financial terms (including any change to the
amount or form of consideration payable) or other revision to the terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide a new
Change of Recommendation Notice to Parent, and any Company Board Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii) following delivery of such new Change of Recommendation Notice shall again be subject to clause (C) and clause (D) of the immediately
preceding sentence for a period of two (2) Business Days.

committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, provided that
any such disclosure by the Company shall state that the Company Board Recommendation continues to be in effect unless, prior to the time of such
public disclosure, a Company Board Recommendation Change has been made in compliance with this Section 5.3.

may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party in the case of a breach of this Agreement
involving Willful Breach or fraud; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to both the
