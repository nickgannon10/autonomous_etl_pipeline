On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (which we refer to as the “DGCL”), Merger Sub will merge with and into NI
(which we refer to as the “Merger”), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and NI will continue

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of NI, Parent, Merger Sub, or
the holders of any securities of NI or Merger Sub, each share of NI common stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (a) each share held by any subsidiary of either NI or Parent (other than Merger Sub)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in NI immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (b) each share that is owned by NI as treasury stock or otherwise (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under any of the Company Equity Plans or the Company
ESPP) or held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be cancelled and will cease
to exist, and (c) shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares
described in (a) and (b)) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of

such Shares, as applicable, pursuant to, and who have properly exercised and perfected their demands for appraisal
rights under and comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to, collectively, as the
“Unconverted Shares”)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $60.00 in cash (which we refer to as
the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any required tax withholding.
No later than the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a designated paying agent a
cash amount that is sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all shares of NI common
stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares described in clauses (a) and (b) of
the definition of the Unconverted Shares). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

share of NI common stock that you own (other than any Unconverted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time
(subject to any required tax withholding), but you will no longer have any rights as an NI stockholder (except that NI
stockholders who properly and validly exercise and do not withdraw their appraisal rights will not be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration and instead will have a right to receive payment of the “fair value” of their shares
as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by the DGCL). For more information, please see
the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of NI Equity Awards

respect of NI common stock (a “Company RSU”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is vested or vests by its terms upon the Effective Time or is held by a non-employee director or former service
provider of NI (whether vested or unvested) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash, subject to applicable withholding, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares of NI common stock subject to such Company RSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each other Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into a restricted stock unit award in respect of Emerson common stock (an “Emerson
RSU”) of equivalent value and with the same terms and conditions as applied to such Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

reasonably necessary to: (i) cause the offering period ongoing under the Company’s 1994 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “Company ESPP”) as of the date of the Merger Agreement to be the final offering period thereunder and the
options under the Company ESPP to be exercised on the earlier of (A) the scheduled purchase date for such offering

The exchange of NI common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal
1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who
exchanges shares of NI common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of NI common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S.
Holder.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the Merger. This description does not address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state, local,
non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S.

If the Merger is consummated, NI stockholders who continuously hold shares of NI common stock through the

shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that NI
stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and follow the
procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by
the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of NI common
stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount
3TABLE OF CONTENTS
determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between
the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each
NI stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity
of the appraisal process, NI stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section
262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
NI stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that
they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to NI before the vote is
taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to hold your shares of NI common stock of record through the Effective
Time; and (d) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your
appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the
Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the NI stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by
Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://
delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is incorporated herein by reference. If you hold your
shares of NI common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you may make a written demand for appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the conditions set forth
above and your written demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which demand is
made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or
securities account statement containing such information or a letter from a broker or other record holder of such
shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of
what it purports to be, and provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving
corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f) of the
DGCL. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the

In connection with the Merger Agreement, a complaint has been filed in federal court as an individual action.
The complaint is captioned as O’Dell v. National Instruments Corporation, et al., 23-cv-04189 (filed May 19, 2023 in
the Southern District of New York) (which we refer to as the “Complaint”).
The Complaint alleges that the preliminary proxy statement filed by NI on May 11, 2023 in connection with the
Merger Agreement (the “Preliminary Proxy”) misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information. The
Complaint asserts violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder
against NI and the members of the Board of Directors. The Complaint seeks, among other things: (i) an injunction
enjoining the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii)
rescission or rescissory damages in the event the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement are consummated; (iii) direction that defendants account for all damages suffered as a result of any
wrongdoing; (iv) costs of the action, including plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and experts' fees; and (v) other relief the
court may deem just and proper. In addition to the Complaint, starting on May 18, 2023, purported stockholders of NI
sent demand letters (which we refer to as the “Demands,” and together with the Complaint, as the “Matters”) alleging
similar deficiencies regarding the disclosures made in the Preliminary Proxy.
NI cannot predict the outcomes of the Matters. NI management believes that the Matters are without merit and
intends to vigorously defend against the Matters and any subsequent demands or filed actions. If additional similar
complaints are filed or demands sent, absent new or significantly different allegations, NI will not necessarily disclose
such additional filings or demands.

24-month period prior to the date of the Merger Agreement return or destroy all confidential information furnished by
or on behalf of NI, and NI has agreed to confirm to Parent the receipt of all certifications of such return or destruction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the NI
stockholders, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial
advisors that a bona fide written Alternative Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
(as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Non-Solicitation Covenant”), NI
may, among other things and subject to certain requirements, furnish nonpublic information to the third party making
such Alternative Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to such
Alternative Proposal, in each case to the extent failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Board of Director’s
fiduciary duties under applicable law.
7TABLE OF CONTENTS
NI has agreed to promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if any inquiries, proposals
or offers with respect to an Alternative Proposal are received by NI or any of its representatives, which notice must
identify the third party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Alternative Proposal, and, after
taking such action, NI has agreed to continue to promptly advise Parent on a reasonably current basis of the status
and terms of any material discussions with respect to any such Alternative Proposal and promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided
to NI or any of its subsidiaries that describes any material terms or conditions of any such Alternative Proposal.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Non-
Solicitation Covenant.”
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by NI stockholders, the Board of Directors is entitled to change
its recommendation regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and/or to terminate the Merger Agreement, as
applicable, for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal or in light of an
Intervening Event (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - The Board of
Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”) if it complies with certain procedures in the Merger
Agreement, including giving Parent appropriate notice of such intention and negotiating further in good faith with
Parent at Parent’s option before the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after having consulted with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement - The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation.”
The termination of the Merger Agreement by NI in connection with the Board of Directors’ authorization for NI
to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal
will result in the payment by NI of a termination fee of $310 million. For more information, please see the section of
this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees.”

In addition to the circumstances described above, Parent and NI have certain rights to terminate the Merger
Agreement under customary circumstances, including (i) by mutual agreement, (ii) if any governmental entity with
competent jurisdiction over Parent or NI has issued a final and nonappealable injunction or similar order or any law
that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, (iii) an uncured breach in any material respect of the Merger Agreement by the other party, (iv) if
the Merger has not been consummated on or before April 12, 2024 (which we refer to as the “End Date”, and which
may be extended to July 12, 2024 and October 12, 2024 under certain circumstances) or (v) if NI stockholders fail to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof). Under certain
circumstances, (a) NI is required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to $310 million and (b) Parent is required to pay
NI a termination fee equal to $310 million. For more information, please see the sections of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement,” “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fee

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the
Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are
important to you. You should carefully read and consider the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this
proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the
documents we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the
Merger and how it affects you. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement
without charge by following the instructions in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find

Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
This document is being delivered to you because you are a stockholder of NI. The Board of Directors is
furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the NI stockholders in connection with the solicitation
of proxies to be voted at the Special Meeting.

A:
The Special Meeting is scheduled to be held virtually via live webcast on June 29, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. Central
Daylight Time (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed). There will not be a physical meeting
location. We believe a virtual-only meeting format facilitates stockholder attendance and participation by
enabling all stockholders to participate fully, equally and without cost, using an Internet-connected device from
any location around the world. In addition, the virtual-only meeting format increases our ability to engage with
all stockholders, regardless of size, resources or physical location and enables us to protect the health and
safety of all attendees.
NI stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NATI2023SM, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting website.” On the

recommend that you log in to our virtual meeting platform at least 15 minutes before the scheduled start time of
the Special Meeting to ensure that you can access the meeting. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the
virtual meeting during the check-in or meeting time, please call the phone number displayed on the virtual
meeting platform on the meeting date. If you encounter any technical difficulties with the virtual meeting during
the log in or meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be posted on the virtual meeting log
in page. Rules governing the conduct of the Special Meeting will be posted on the virtual meeting platform
along with an agenda.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal;
•
to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and
•
to approve the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
NI stockholders as of the Record Date of May 23, 2023 are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote
at the Special Meeting. Each holder of shares of NI common stock shall be entitled to cast one vote on each
matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the close of business on the
Record Date. Virtual attendance at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website is not required to vote.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of NI common stock prior to the
announcement of the Merger Agreement?
A:
The Merger Consideration of $60.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 49% over the closing price
of NI common stock on January 12, 2023, the last full trading day prior to NI’s public announcement
9TABLE OF CONTENTS
of its strategic review and a 57% premium to NI’s 30-day volume-weighted average share price of $38.11 as of
January 12, 2023. The closing price of NI common stock on NASDAQ on May 24, 2023, the most recent
practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, was $57.66. You are encouraged to obtain current
market prices of NI common stock in connection with voting your shares of NI common stock.
Q:
May I attend and vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
All NI stockholders as of the Record Date may attend and vote at the Special Meeting.
Shares held directly in your name as an NI stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the
Special Meeting website. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special
Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Even if you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or
by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting”) so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to or
become unable to virtually attend the Special Meeting. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, your
vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $60.00 in cash,
without interest, subject to any required tax withholding, for each share of NI common stock that you own (other
than any Unconverted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you have properly and validly
exercised (and do not withdraw) your appraisal rights in accordance with, and complied with, Section 262 of the
DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of NI common stock, you will receive $6,000 in cash in exchange for
your shares of NI common stock (other than any Unconverted Shares), without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes. Unconverted Shares means (a) each share held by any subsidiary of either NI or Parent (other
than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be converted into such number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same percentage of the
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
subsidiary owned in NI immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) each share that is owned by NI as treasury
stock or otherwise (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under
any of the Company Equity Plans or the Company ESPP) or held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time, which will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and (c) shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares described in (a) and (b)) and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of such Shares, as applicable.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of NI common stock?
A:
The exchange of NI common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder who exchanges shares of NI common stock for cash in the
Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of NI
common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S. Holder.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the Merger. This description does not address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state,
local, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment
under U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax
consequences to you of the Merger.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of NI common stock entitled to vote
thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of
10
TABLE OF CONTENTS
NI common stock representing a majority of the voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Compensation Proposal is required to
approve the Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of NI common stock
representing a majority of the voting power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of the
Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any NI stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed
proxy card; (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in
the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting”); or (c) attend
the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but,
assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If you properly sign
your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2)
“FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What constitutes a quorum?
A:
The holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote present in person,
or by remote communication, or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. Because
there were 132,774,458 shares of NI common stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the Record Date, we
will need holders of at least 66,387,230 shares present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting to achieve a quorum.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by NI stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other
reason, NI stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of NI common stock. Instead, NI will
remain an independent public company, NI common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and
registered under the Exchange Act, and NI will continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, NI will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $310 million, upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Termination Fees.”
Q:
Why are NI stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require NI to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote with
respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger.
Q:
What will happen if NI stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with
respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on NI. Therefore, if the
approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable
under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to NI’s named executive officers in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements regardless of whether the Compensation Proposal is
approved.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,
including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as
1
1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign,
date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope,
or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting”), so that
your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the
voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
Should I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Exchange and Payment Procedures”) will, as soon as reasonably practical after the
Effective Time, and in any event not later than two business days following the Closing Date, send each holder
of record of NI common stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
(A) a letter of transmittal and (B) instructions that explain how to surrender certificates or book-entry shares of
NI common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of NI common stock after the Record Date but before
the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger
is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of NI common stock after the Record Date but
before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you
and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies NI in writing of such
special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed,
to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the
Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of NI common stock after the Record Date,
we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope
or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting”).
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as an NI stockholder of record and holding shares in “street
name” as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered to
be the “stockholder of record” with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy
card have been sent directly to you by NI.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of NI common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you
by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the NI stockholder
of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to vote on the Internet, by telephone or, if you received a
paper copy of the proxy materials, by completing, signing and mailing the proxy card enclosed therewith in the
postage-prepaid envelope provided for that purpose.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are an NI stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of NI common stock are registered in your name
with Computershare, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
Internet: Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system is
available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on June 28, 2023. Once you enter the
Internet voting system, you can record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
•
Telephone: Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available
24 hours a day in the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on June 28, 2023. Once you enter
the telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change) your
voting instructions.
 
12
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Mail: Mark your voting instructions on the card and sign, date and return it in the postage-paid envelope
provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before 11:59 p.m. on June 28, 2023.
•
At the Special Meeting: Shares held directly in your name as an NI stockholder of record may be voted at
the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the
Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or
other nominee.
If your shares of NI common stock are held “in street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee, the holder of
your shares will provide you with a copy of this proxy statement, a voting instruction form and directions on
how to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the Internet or by telephone.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy to
ensure your vote is counted. We encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, both of
which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. You may still
attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat if you have already voted by proxy.
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the
Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy
card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be
responsible.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is an NI stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such NI
stockholder on their behalf. If you are an NI stockholder of record, or beneficially in street name, you can vote
by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy
card. If you hold shares beneficially in “street name,” you should follow the voting instructions provided by
your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
If an NI stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this proxy
statement. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy by any of the
following actions:
•
Notifying our Corporate Secretary in writing at 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759;
•
Signing and returning a later dated proxy card;
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Submitting a new proxy electronically via the Internet or by telephone; or
•
Voting at the Special Meeting. Please note that virtual attendance at the Special Meeting will not by itself
constitute revocation of a proxy.
Any change to your proxy that is provided by telephone or the Internet must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Daylight Time on June 28, 2023.
If you hold your shares of NI common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the
Special Meeting website.
If you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:

Email: proxy@mackenziepartners.com
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
This means you own shares of NI common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than
one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as an NI stockholder of record and other shares
through a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive
multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions
for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares
you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by
mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address
with another NI stockholder?
A:
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for
proxy statements with respect to two or more NI stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single
proxy statement to those NI stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,”
potentially provides extra convenience for NI stockholders and cost savings for companies.
NI and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to
multiple NI stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been
received from the affected NI stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and
would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these
documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify our investor
relations department at 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759, (512) 683-5215, or, if the latter, you
may also contact your broker or other nominee record holder.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In
addition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, NI will file the final voting
results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been certified, the preliminary results)
with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
NI has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc., which we refer to as “MacKenzie,” to assist in the solicitation of
proxies for the Special Meeting. NI estimates that it will pay MacKenzie a fee of approximately $50,000, plus
reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. NI has agreed to indemnify MacKenzie against
various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain
exceptions).
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
NI also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective agents for
their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of NI common stock. NI directors, officers and
employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They will not be paid any
additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect the Merger to be completed in the first half of Emerson’s fiscal year 2024. However, the exact
timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions
specified in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our
control.
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about NI?
A:
NI will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2023 Annual Report
to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (which
we refer to as “Annual Report”), without charge to any NI stockholder who makes a request in writing to our
Corporate Secretary at 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759. The requested documents will be
provided by first class mail or other similarly prompt means. NI’s Annual Report and other SEC filings may also
be accessed at https://sec.gov or on NI’s Investor website at http://investor.ni.com. NI’s website address is
provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is
not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to
our website provided in this proxy statement.

Only NI stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the
Special Meeting. A list of NI stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal
executive offices located at 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759, during regular business hours for a
period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting, as well as on the Special Meeting website during the
Special Meeting. If NI’s headquarters are closed during such period for health and safety reasons related to the

Secretary at 11500 North Mopac Expressway, subject to the satisfactory verification of NI stockholder status. The list
will also be available electronically during the Special Meeting on the Special Meeting website. As of the Record
Date, there were 132,774,458 shares of NI common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
The presence, in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of

Each NI stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of NI common stock owned at the close of
business on the Record Date.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of NI common stock entitled to vote
thereon is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. As of the Record Date, 66,387,230 votes constitute a
majority of the outstanding shares of NI common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by NI stockholders is a
condition to the consummation of the Merger.
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of NI common stock representing a majority of the voting
power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to
vote on the Compensation Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation
Proposal.
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of NI common stock representing a majority of the voting
power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to
vote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any NI stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed
proxy card; (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting”); or (c) attend the
Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is
present at the Special Meeting, for NI stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are represented by proxy and
abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the NI stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger
Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
18TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called
“broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or
matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal
because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting
instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. NI does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary
authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine,” whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the
Special Meeting is considered “non-routine.” As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of NI
common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote
your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by returning the

encourages you to vote over the Internet or by phone as NI believes they are the most cost-effective methods. We
also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the Special Meeting, so that
the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective and
reliable alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares over the Internet or by
telephone, there is no need for you to submit your proxy card by mail.
To Vote Over the Internet:
Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours

To Vote by Telephone:
Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours per
day in the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on June 28, 2023. Once you enter the telephone voting

proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR”
the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. If you indicate on your
19TABLE OF CONTENTS
proxy card that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the
Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, your shares of NI common
stock will be voted “FOR” each such proposal. Proxy cards that are returned without a signature will not be counted
as present at the Special Meeting and cannot be voted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee or attending the Special Meeting and voting using your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control

service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by
following the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return
your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank,
broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, it will have the same
effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will not have
any effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal (so long as you do not attend the Special
Meeting and abstain from voting on any given proposal, which would have the same effect as voting “AGAINST”
the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and/or the Adjournment Proposal, as applicable).",28,29

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, NI stockholders who continuously hold shares of NI common stock through the
Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and properly demand appraisal of their
shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that NI
stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and follow the
procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by
the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of NI common
stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair
value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount
determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each NI
stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of
the appraisal process, NI stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section
262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
NI stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares. 
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to NI before the vote is
taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to hold your shares of NI common stock of record through the Effective
Time; and (d) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your
appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the
Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the NI stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by
Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://
delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is incorporated herein by reference. If you hold your
shares of NI common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you may make a written demand for appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the conditions set forth
above and your written demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which demand is
made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or
securities account statement

information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be,

On May 16, 2022, Lal Karsanbhai, President and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson, contacted Eric Starkloff,
NI’s President and Chief Executive Officer, regarding Emerson’s potential interest in an acquisition of NI. Mr. Starkloff
and Mr. Karsanbhai spoke on May 25, 2022, during which Mr. Karsanbhai indicated that Emerson was interested in a
potential acquisition of NI.
On May 25, 2022, Emerson emailed a letter to NI (the “May 25 Letter”). The May 25 Letter contained a proposal
to acquire all of the outstanding shares of NI for $48 in cash per share. The May 25 Letter noted, among other things,
that Emerson’s proposal was based on publicly available information and was subject to the completion of customary
and confirmatory due diligence. The May 25 Letter also noted that the proposal was not subject to any financing
condition and that Emerson was prepared to work with NI and its advisors to complete due diligence and negotiate a
mutually agreeable merger agreement in parallel.
On May 26, 2022, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) met, with representatives of its legal counsel, Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”) in attendance. The Board and management discussed the May 25 Letter,
current NI strategy and business performance as well as prior discussions with the Board regarding NI’s prospects
and positioning, engagement of outside advisors and other next steps. The Board agreed to reconvene in June to
continue the discussion, including with the assistance of outside financial advisors and its legal advisors at Wachtell
Lipton.
Between May 26 and June 10, 2022, NI retained BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”) as financial advisor to
NI in connection with its consideration of the May 25 Letter. BofA Securities was selected based on its qualifications,
experience and reputation in the technology sector and its knowledge of NI’s business and affairs. NI executed an
engagement letter with BofA Securities on June 10, 2022 with respect to BofA Securities advising NI regarding the
May 25 Letter. In connection with its engagement by NI, BofA Securities provided a relationship disclosure letter
providing certain information regarding its relationships with NI and Emerson, which relationship disclosure letter
was subsequently updated on January 22, 2023, February 26, 2023, and April 12, 2023.
On June 14, 2022, the Board met, with representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. In
consultation with its advisors, the Board and management further discussed the May 25 Letter, NI’s strategy,
performance and valuation considerations, and potential responses to Emerson. The Board discussed the timing of
Emerson’s proposal, taking into account broader market and industry volatility and company-specific circumstances,
such as, among others, that NI’s strategic plan was in the early stages of realization. The Board members concluded
that Emerson’s proposal substantially undervalued NI, including relative to the potential value that could be realized
and unlocked from execution of NI’s strategic plan and relative to the valuation methodologies presented by BofA
Securities and discussed with the Board. In light of these considerations, the Board unanimously determined to reject
Emerson’s proposal and directed management to convey this determination to Emerson.
On June 16, 2022, NI emailed a letter to Emerson (the “June 16 Letter”), signed by Mr. Starkloff and Michael E.
McGrath, Chairman of NI’s Board, which stated that the NI Board had carefully reviewed the
25TABLE OF CONTENTS
May 25 Letter, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, and that the Board had unanimously determined
that the proposal outlined in the May 25 Letter did not provide a basis for further discussions. The June 16 Letter
also stated that NI’s Board and management team would remain focused on executing NI’s strategies that are
producing a significant and steady increase in bookings and revenue, strengthened operational performance, and
advances in technology.
On June 22, 2022, Emerson emailed a letter to NI (the “June 22 Letter”) stating that Emerson was disappointed in
NI’s response and reiterated Emerson’s proposal to acquire NI for $48 per share. The June 22 Letter noted that
Emerson had engaged advisors and was prepared to work with NI and its advisors to complete due diligence and
negotiate a mutually agreeable merger agreement. Emerson also requested access to limited nonpublic information
subject to a non-disclosure agreement.
On July 19 and 20, 2022, the Board held meetings in Austin, Texas, during which members of NI management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton participated. During these meetings, the Board and management discussed the
June 22 Letter and various aspects of Emerson’s outreach, including that the June 22 Letter reaffirmed Emerson’s
prior inadequate proposal, the potential for Emerson to change its offer and the degree to which Emerson would
pursue the potential transaction, the potential for entry into a confidentiality agreement and engaging in due
diligence and negotiations with Emerson, and various strategic and financial alternatives. The Board reaffirmed its
view that Emerson’s proposal was not in the best interests of NI and its stockholders and did not reflect the value
expected to be generated by NI’s business strategies. Following discussion, the Board concluded that the proposal
from Emerson did not merit engaging in further discussions with or providing diligence materials to Emerson. The
Board also discussed with management and its advisors the potential steps NI could take at the upcoming earnings
call to highlight NI’s momentum, prospects, margin priorities and other financial and operating performance matters.
Following discussion, the Board unanimously determined to reaffirm its continued rejection of Emerson’s proposal
and authorized Mr. McGrath, Mr. Starkloff and R. Eddie Dixon, Jr., NI’s Chief Legal Officer, Senior Vice President and
Secretary, to determine the precise manner and content for communicating the reaffirmed rejection to Emerson.
On August 2, 2022, NI emailed a letter to Emerson (the “August 2 Letter”). The August 2 Letter stated that the
NI Board had carefully reviewed the June 22 Letter, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, and that the
Board remained unanimously of the view that Emerson’s proposal was not in the best interests of NI and its
stockholders.
On November 3, 2022, Emerson emailed a letter to NI (the “November 3 Letter”), which increased Emerson’s
proposal to acquire NI from $48 per share to $53 per share. The November 3 Letter further stated that, in preparation
for all options, Emerson had accumulated 2.3 million NI shares in the open market and intended to file for approval
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”) to facilitate additional purchases, and that
Emerson was prepared to run a slate of directors targeting the two members of the Board up for re-election at NI’s
next annual meeting.
On November 4, 2022, NI emailed a letter to Emerson confirming receipt of the November 3 Letter and stating
that Mr. Starkloff and Mr. McGrath would discuss with the NI Board.
On November 10, 2022, the Board met, with representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Mr. McGrath
proposed establishing, in the interests of efficiency, an ad hoc committee of the Board, which would meet regularly to
evaluate, with the input of senior management and the Board’s external legal and financial advisors, proposals as to
extraordinary transactions made by third parties, including Emerson, and other potential alternative extraordinary
transactions and related strategic matters. The committee, which would consist of Mr. McGrath as Chair and James
Cashman, III and Gayla Delly as members, would not have decision making authority, which authority would remain
with the full Board. Following discussion, the Board unanimously approved resolutions establishing such a
committee (the “Transaction Evaluation Committee” or the “TEC”). The Board and management discussed the
proposal from Emerson, other potential strategic partners and synergies with such potential partners. The Board and
management, along with Wachtell Lipton, discussed next steps for drafting a response to the November 3 Letter.
Wachtell Lipton also discussed the timing of a response in connection with Emerson’s upcoming investor day, and
the timing of a potential proxy fight.
Following the Board meeting on November 10, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI
management and representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. The members of the TEC discussed with the
representatives from Wachtell Lipton the content and tenor of NI’s response to the November 3 Letter,
26
TABLE OF CONTENTS
which the TEC would draft and submit to the full Board for approval. The members of the TEC and Wachtell Lipton
also discussed considerations that would be relevant if Emerson were to make its proposal to acquire NI public and
how NI might respond to a public disclosure by Emerson.
On November 15, 2022, NI emailed a letter to Emerson (the “November 15 Letter”) stating that NI and its Board
take Emerson’s proposal seriously, and notifying Emerson that the Board had established a working group of the
Board to examine Emerson’s proposal in greater detail as NI examines and evaluates options with the assistance of its
advisors, inclusive of other prospective purchasers and transaction partners.
On November 16, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. The members of the TEC discussed go-forward approaches with
respect to various items, including evaluating potential strategic and business options and actions for NI, the multi-
year transformation of NI currently underway, engagement with Emerson following the latest communications
between NI and Emerson, including the November 15 Letter, potential actions that Emerson might take, and the
likelihood that other potential transaction partners and acquirers could be interested in pursuing a transaction with
NI, among other topics.
Later on November 16, Emerson emailed a notice to NI that Emerson is an “acquiring person” under the HSR Act
and intended to file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice to acquire 50% or more of NI voting securities.
On November 23, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. They discussed the timing and steps of a typical tender offer and
response and the process of a typical proxy fight, key dates leading to NI’s annual meeting, including NI’s and
Emerson’s earnings releases, NI’s nomination window for stockholder director nominations, illustrative timing for
Emerson’s earnings releases, NI’s nomination window for stockholder director nominations, illustrative timing for
filing proxy statements in a potential proxy fight, and related SEC deadlines. The members of the TEC also discussed
NI’s options for potential actions to protect the interests of NI and its stockholders, including the potential adoption
of a shareholder rights plan.
On November 28, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and
Alexander Davern, director and former Chief Executive Officer of NI, in attendance. The members of the TEC
discussed expectations and timing for upcoming TEC and Board meetings, including a review of the valuation
analysis that BofA Securities was preparing based on NI’s updated financial plan. Mr. Starkloff presented NI’s 2023-
2025 business plan.
On December 1, 2022, the independent directors of NI held a meeting during which the members of the
Transaction Evaluation Committee informed the independent directors of the actions taken to date by the TEC and
anticipated next steps. Mr. McGrath discussed the business plan that had been presented by Mr. Starkloff at the prior
TEC meeting and noted that it would be used by BofA Securities for a forthcoming valuation presentation. Mr.
McGrath provided an outline of next steps, including a special meeting of the Board to be held on December 11 to
review NI’s business plan and BofA Securities’ analysis and to review response options and determine next steps
with respect to Emerson or other alternative paths. Mr. McGrath also noted the possibility of a tender offer by
Emerson and discussed actions to be taken in preparation for responding in such a scenario.
On December 5, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. The TEC discussed the possibility of initiating a strategic review
process, pursuant to which the Board would review and consider NI’s strategic options, including exploring potential
offers from third parties to acquire NI, and various considerations concerning whether a strategic review process
would be announced publicly or conducted privately. The TEC discussed with its advisors the likely timing for a
potential strategic review process and the potential outcomes of such a process, including the possibility that the
Board could determine at the conclusion of such a process that remaining independent could be in the best interests
of NI and its stockholders. The TEC and Wachtell Lipton discussed that, as part of any strategic review process,
Emerson would be encouraged to engage with NI regarding a potential transaction.
On December 7, 2022, Sara Bosco, Emerson’s Senior Vice President, Secretary and Chief Legal Officer, sent a
letter to Mr. Dixon stating that, in connection with Emerson’s anticipated nomination of persons for election to the
Board of NI, Emerson requested a copy of the written representation and agreement and the written questionnaire
required under NI’s bylaws to be included in Emerson’s notice of nomination.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 10, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and
representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. The TEC discussed the features of a potential strategic review
process and considered the appropriate timing of such a process should it be undertaken and the criteria the Board
might use for deciding whether to pursue a transaction or remain independent. The TEC considered potential
strategic partners that might engage with NI in a strategic review process, possible synergies with these partners,
and the use of clean team arrangements with certain counterparties if needed. The TEC also discussed, in light of
Emerson’s proposals to NI, whether the process would be conducted privately or announced publicly and, if the
latter, what a press release announcing the strategic review might include.
On December 11, 2022, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of BofA Securities
and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Mr. Starkloff and other members of NI’s management presented to the Board an
overview of NI’s updated strategic plan. Among other topics, they summarized the transformational work that had
taken place over the past several years, the bookings outlook and revenue assumptions, cost-cutting measures
including an expected workforce reduction, NI’s market position, and margin improvement. BofA Securities presented
to the Board industry trading statistics and data on select precedent transactions, including transactions in which
Emerson was the acquirer. BofA Securities reviewed with the Board an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis,
highlighting key changes from the prior analysis presented to the Board in June, and a summary valuation of NI.
BofA Securities also discussed potential partners that could be contacted as part of a strategic review process and
the likely ability of those partners to participate in a process based on the composition of their balance sheets and
other factors. Mr. McGrath summarized for the Board the key developments and discussions of the Transaction
Evaluation Committee to date. Mr. McGrath and the other members of the TEC then discussed with the Board the
Board’s options for responding to Emerson’s proposal and potential next steps by Emerson in reaction to each
potential response by NI. The TEC conveyed its view that it would be in the best interest of NI’s stockholders to
explore initiating a strategic review process pursuant to which the Board would review and consider NI’s strategic
options, including any proposals by Emerson. The Board authorized the TEC to work with Mr. Starkloff and NI’s
financial and legal advisors to develop a communication to Emerson regarding its proposal and to continue making
preparations for a strategic review process.
On December 14, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and
representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Mr. Starkloff reviewed key topics for the
meeting as a result of the December 11 Board meeting, at which the Board had authorized the TEC to continue making
preparations for a strategic review process. The TEC and the others present discussed the appropriate timing for
conducting the strategic review process. Following the guidance of the Board at the December 11 Board meeting, the
TEC determined that Mr. Starkloff should respond to Emerson’s letter indicating that NI would be willing to enter into
a suitable confidentiality agreement with Emerson and subsequently provide Emerson with nonpublic information
about NI pursuant to such an agreement. The TEC and the others present discussed the timing and approach for a
potential meeting with Emerson to provide additional information about NI.
Following the TEC meeting on December 14, Mr. Dixon e-mailed a letter to Ms. Bosco confirming that NI was in
receipt of Emerson’s request regarding the materials referenced in the December 7 Letter and that NI would provide
Emerson with the documents shortly.
On December 14, Ms. Bosco sent a demand letter to Mr. Dixon pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law requesting the opportunity to inspect certain stockholder list materials of NI in connection with
Emerson’s solicitation of proxies from stockholders of NI with respect to NI’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders
(the “220 Demand”). The 220 Demand sought a response from NI by December 22, 2022.
On December 15, 2022, Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai spoke by telephone to discuss next steps and a
potential in-person meeting between NI and Emerson in the coming weeks.
On December 16, 2022, Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai exchanged emails to schedule an in-person meeting on
January 4, 2023 in Austin, Texas (the “January 4 Meeting”). That same day, Wachtell Lipton sent a draft
confidentiality agreement (the “NI-Emerson NDA”) to Emerson’s legal counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (“DPW”).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 19, 2022, DPW returned the draft NI-Emerson NDA with comments to Wachtell Lipton. That same
day, Wachtell Lipton sent DPW the director nominee form of representation and agreement and the director
questionnaire as requested in the December 7 Letter. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on December 19, 2022.
On December 20, 2022, Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai discussed the timing and topics for discussion during
the upcoming January 4 Meeting. Also on December 20, 2022, Wachtell Lipton and DPW had a call to discuss the NI-
Emerson NDA.
On December 21, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and
representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Wachtell Lipton summarized the terms of the
draft NI-Emerson NDA that had been sent to DPW on December 16 and the subsequent discussions between
Wachtell Lipton and DPW. Mr. Starkloff then provided an update on his correspondence with Mr. Karsanbhai related
to the January 4 Meeting. Mr. Starkloff and BofA Securities also discussed the diligence list topics sent by Emerson
in advance of the meeting. The TEC and the others present discussed the potential timing for publicly announcing
the strategic review process following the January 4 Meeting and next steps.
On December 22, 2022, Wachtell Lipton sent a letter to DPW advising that NI would make books and records
available to Emerson in response to its 220 Demand subject to a confidentiality agreement (the “220 NDA”). On
December 23, DPW sent a revised draft of the director nominee form representation and agreement to Wachtell
Lipton, and, on December 27, DPW sent a revised draft of the 220 NDA to Wachtell Lipton.
On December 23, 2022, NI and Emerson executed the NI-Emerson NDA, which provided for a standstill lasting
until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 6, 2023.
On December 28, 2022, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management and
representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Dixon provided an
overview of the agenda for the January 4 Meeting, and Mr. Starkloff previewed the presentation materials and topics
for discussion at the meeting. Following discussion, the TEC decided that Ms. Delly, as Chair of the Board’s Audit
Committee, would attend the meeting to provide continuity given NI’s Chief Financial Officer transition.
On January 4, 2023, representatives from NI and Emerson, including Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai, met in
Austin, Texas, during which representatives from Emerson provided an overview of Emerson’s strategy and plans for
the test and measurement business, and the representatives from NI then presented materials about NI. Mr. Starkloff
concluded the meeting by proposing to extend the standstill agreement between the two companies for approximately
one week so that Emerson could consider revising its proposal to acquire NI in the context of the nonpublic
information it had just received, to which Mr. Karsanbhai responded that he would reply shortly.
Also on January 4, following the meeting with Emerson, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with all
members of the Board, members of NI management, and representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in
attendance. Mr. Starkloff, Ms. Delly, and Mr. Dixon summarized the meeting with Emerson that morning, including the
key questions that the representatives from Emerson had raised during NI’s presentation. Wachtell Lipton discussed
the shareholder rights plan that the Board was considering adopting in connection with announcing a strategic
review process in order to ensure the integrity of such a process and create a level playing field for all participants,
including the terms and mechanics of the rights plan, the process for the Board’s adoption of the rights plan, and the
potential timing for adoption of the rights plan and announcement thereof.
On January 5, 2023, Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai spoke by phone. Mr. Karsanbhai reiterated Emerson’s view
that $53 per share was a fair valuation for NI but stated that there could be an opportunity for a modest increase if NI
provided Emerson with additional information.
Later that day, NI and Emerson amended the NI-Emerson NDA to extend the standstill from January 6, 2023 at
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time to January 13, 2023 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 10, 2023, Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai spoke by phone to confirm the timing of Emerson’s
revised offer and to discuss the potential value of the offer. Mr. Karsanbhai assured Mr. Starkloff that Emerson would
submit a revised offer by the following afternoon with a merger agreement that Emerson would be prepared to sign
and announce before NI’s next earnings call and suggested that there may not be much of an increase in the bid
price.
On the morning of January 11, 2023, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with Mr. Dixon in attendance.
The TEC discussed the January 4 Meeting, which Ms. Delly had attended, Emerson’s current proposal and the
possibility of an updated proposal from Emerson later that day.
On the afternoon of January 11, Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai spoke to discuss Emerson’s revised offer. Mr.
Karsanbhai informed Mr. Starkloff that Emerson had not changed its valuation of NI and was not prepared to provide
an increased offer at this time, but that there might be a modest increase if NI met other specified conditions including
first negotiating a merger agreement, which merger agreement Mr. Karsanbhai indicated he would provide, among
other things.
Following the call, Emerson emailed a letter to NI (the “January 11 Letter”) reiterating Emerson’s proposal to
purchase 100% of the outstanding common stock of NI for $53 per share in cash and offering to extend the standstill
by one week. Following delivery of the January 11 Letter to Mr. Starkloff and Mr. McGrath, DPW sent a draft merger
agreement to Wachtell Lipton.
Also on January 11, the Chief Executive Officer of Party A called Mr. Starkloff, expressing that Party A was
interested in a potential business combination with NI and would be able to move quickly if NI were interested in
considering such a potential combination.
On January 12, 2023, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of BofA Securities and
Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Mr. Starkloff provided an overview of his conversation with Mr. Karsanbhai the day
before. The Board discussed the January 11 Letter and the draft merger agreement that DPW had sent to Wachtell
Lipton. The Board also discussed the shareholder rights plan that it planned to adopt in connection with initiating a
strategic review process to ensure an even playing field and that no potential participant would have an unfair
advantage in the process by accumulating a large number of shares of NI without paying a premium and using such
stakeholding to put pressure on NI. Wachtell Lipton reviewed the terms of the rights plan, including its duration,
thresholds for passive and active investors, and the steps that would take place following Board adoption. Wachtell
Lipton and BofA Securities then discussed the steps that would take place the next day in connection with the
announcement of the strategic review process, including the issuance of the press release, employee
communications, and conversations with investors. Wachtell Lipton and BofA Securities discussed with the Board
the forms of confidentiality agreement that would be shared with strategic parties and financial sponsors interested in
participating in the process, the potential timeline for the strategic review process and the potential counterparties
who would be contacted as part of the process. The Board approved the adoption of the rights plan and authorized
management to announce the strategic review process and the adoption of the rights plan via press release the
following morning.
On the morning of January 13, 2023, NI issued a press release announcing that its Board had initiated a review
and evaluation of strategic options, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, with the intent to unlock and
maximize shareholder value and that the comprehensive review would include consideration of a full range of
available strategic, business and financial alternatives, including solicitation of interest from potential acquirers and
other transaction partners, some of whom had already approached NI. NI also announced in the press release that the
Board had adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan and authorized a dividend distribution of one right for
each outstanding share of common stock.
On the day of and in the days following public announcement of the strategic review process, Mr. Starkloff and
BofA Securities reached out to and received inbound communications from parties interested in participating in the
process. On January 13, Mr. Starkloff had a conversation with the Chief Executive Officer of Party B who expressed
Party B’s interest in NI and desire to participate in the process. On January 14, 2023, Mr. Starkloff had an in-person
meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of Party A to discuss Party A’s potential participation in the strategic review
process.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On the morning of January 17, 2023, Emerson issued a press release announcing that it had submitted a proposal
to the Board of NI to acquire NI for $53 per share. The press release stated that the proposal was submitted to NI on
November 3, 2022 and represented an improvement over an initial $48 per share proposal submitted on May 25, 2022
and outlined prior engagement between the two companies.
In the afternoon of January 17, NI issued a press release confirming that it had received the Emerson proposal
and stating that NI’s Board would evaluate Emerson’s proposal within the context of the ongoing strategic review
process.
Also on January 17, following several rounds of comments and discussion over the prior weeks, NI and
Emerson executed the 220 NDA.
Following the public announcements by Emerson and NI, Mr. Karsanbhai contacted Mr. Starkloff via email to
schedule a call.
On the morning of January 18, 2023, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with members of NI management
and representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. BofA Securities provided an update on the
strategic review process, including each potential counterparty that had been contacted by Mr. Starkloff or BofA
Securities in connection with the process or that had reached out to BofA Securities following the public
announcement of the process, which included strategic parties and financial sponsors. The TEC also discussed Mr.
Starkloff’s upcoming call with Mr. Karsanbhai, scheduled for later that morning, and potential next steps from
Emerson.
Later that morning, Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai spoke by phone and discussed the timeline and next steps.
Mr. Starkloff described the strategic review process and his hope that Emerson would participate in the process,
noting that he had instructed BofA Securities to reach out to Emerson’s financial advisors to discuss next steps.
Between January 20, 2023 and February 9, 2023, NI executed confidentiality agreements with six parties,
including Party A, Party B, and Party C. The confidentiality agreements included standstill provisions, none of which
standstill provisions remain in effect.
On January 22, 2023, Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai spoke by phone, and Mr. Karsanbhai informed Mr.
Starkloff that Emerson did not intend to pursue director nominations for NI’s 2023 annual meeting.
On January 23, 2023, Emerson issued a press release stating that Emerson had been pleased to see engagement
over the course of the previous week between the management teams and advisors for NI and Emerson, that Emerson
was optimistic that the NI Board had commenced a process that Emerson believed would lead to the sale of NI, and
that NI had confirmed that Emerson would be a participant in that process. The press release further stated that
Emerson had decided to proceed in its pursuit of acquiring NI without nominating its selected independent directors
for election to NI’s Board at NI’s upcoming annual meeting.
On January 24 and 25, 2023, the Board held meetings in Austin, Texas, during which members of NI management
and representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton participated. BofA Securities provided an update on the
strategic review process, including engagement with Emerson and each other potential counterparty that had either
been contacted by BofA Securities or had reached out to BofA Securities or NI in connection with the strategic
review process. The Board and the others present discussed next steps in the process, which would include sending
a process letter to interested counterparties following the conclusion of management presentations to those parties.

interactions with the potential parties in the process. The TEC and the others present discussed timing and next
steps for the process, including the potential due date for parties to submit indications of interest as part of phase
one of the process, and the TEC directed BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton to proceed as discussed.
On February 10, 2023, BofA Securities sent a process letter to each of the seven parties that had signed
confidentiality agreements, including Emerson, requesting that the parties submit preliminary indications of interest
by February 23. Also on February 10, following receipt of the process letter, one of the parties communicated to NI
that it had decided to no longer participate in the strategic review process.
On February 14, 2023, BofA Securities opened an electronic data room with due diligence information and

electronic data room had been shared with each of the potential counterparties.
On the afternoon of February 15, 2023, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of
BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. BofA Securities provided an update on the strategic review
process including the potential counterparties that had participated in management presentations with NI, had
received process letters, and had been provided access to an electronic data room and which parties remained in the
process. BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton then discussed the next steps in the strategic review process, which
would include selecting parties to continue into phase two of the process, which in turn would include further due
diligence and the parties’ comments on a draft merger agreement. The Board authorized its advisors and management
to proceed in the manner described and scheduled a meeting for February 28 to review the indications of interest
expected to be received on February 23.
On February 17, 2023, BofA Securities spoke with Goldman Sachs which, together with Centerview Partners, are
Emerson’s financial advisors, who indicated that Emerson planned to submit an indication of interest on February 23
reaffirming its offer to acquire NI for $53 per share.
On February 23, 2023, four parties submitted nonbinding indications of interest for an acquisition of NI. Party A
offered to acquire NI for $54 per share in cash; Party B offered to acquire NI for $57 per share in cash; Party C offered
to acquire NI for $55 per share in cash; and Emerson reaffirmed its offer to acquire NI for $53 per share in cash.
Additionally, one financial sponsor indicated that it was interested in partnering with a potential buyer in support of
an acquisition of NI by providing an equity investment of $500 million to over $2 billion.
On February 28, 2023, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of BofA Securities
and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. BofA Securities summarized the indications of interest that NI had received on
February 23, which had been provided to the Board in advance of the meeting. BofA Securities described what each
counterparty had proposed in price, financing plans, expected timing to complete due diligence, expected approvals
required, and other terms mentioned in each indication of interest. BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton then
discussed with the Board the next steps for the strategic review process, including which potential counterparties
should be invited to participate in the second phase of the process based on the proposals received from each.
Wachtell Lipton also discussed with the Board the regulatory profile of a potential transaction with each of Emerson,
Party A, Party B, and Party C. Following discussion, the Board authorized management and its advisors to move
forward with the second phase of the strategic review process and to invite Emerson, Party A, Party B, and Party C to
participate in the second phase. BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton then discussed with the Board the timeline and
milestones for phase two of the process, including communications to the counterparties about phase two and their
relative positioning based on the indications of interest, the confirmatory due diligence process (including use of
clean team arrangements for competitively sensitive information), and the process for providing comments on a draft
merger agreement.
On March 1, 2023, BofA Securities called Emerson, Party A, Party B, and Party C, notifying each party that it had
been selected by the Board to participate in phase two of the strategic review process and providing feedback on the
party’s indication of interest. BofA Securities also called the financial sponsor that had indicated interest in providing
an equity investment to a potential acquirer of NI, stating that BofA Securities would reach out to the financial
sponsor if that became of interest at a later point in the strategic review process. Also on March 1, BofA Securities
sent draft clean team agreements to Emerson, Party A, Party B, and Party C.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the afternoon of April 5, 2023, Emerson and Party A each submitted proposals to acquire NI. Emerson
proposed to purchase NI for $57.00 per share in cash. Emerson’s proposal stated that it was not subject to any
financing condition and would be financed from cash on hand, committed lines of credit and/or other available
sources of funding. Additionally, Emerson stated that it had secured a bridge facility of $7.8 billion from Goldman
Sachs and submitted commitment letters along with its proposal. Party A proposed to acquire NI for $56.00 per share
in cash. Party A stated that its proposal was not subject to any financing contingency and submitted commitment
letters for the full amount of the proposed transaction purchase price.
Also on April 5, 2023, the Chief Executive Officer of Party B called Mr. Starkloff to inform him that Party B had
decided to no longer participate in the strategic review process and would not be submitting an updated acquisition
proposal.
On April 7, 2023, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of BofA Securities and
Wachtell Lipton in attendance. BofA Securities provided a summary of the strategic review process to date. Among
other things, BofA Securities discussed with the Board the parties contacted by BofA Securities or who had
contacted BofA Securities or NI with interest in participating in the process, the parties with whom NI had executed a
confidentiality agreement, the parties that had received a management presentation, the four initial indications of
interest received by NI, the three parties that had submitted comments on the draft merger agreement, and the two
parties that had submitted acquisition proposals on April 5 as part of phase two of the strategic review process. BofA
Securities then summarized the key terms of the proposals from Emerson and Party A. BofA Securities and Mr.
Starkloff also described their conversations with the representatives and advisors of Party B, which had provided
comments on the draft merger agreement but did not submit a phase two proposal. Wachtell Lipton discussed the
Board’s fiduciary duties, including in connection with the consideration of a potential sale transaction for cash
consideration. Wachtell Lipton also provided a comparison of the two submitted proposals and discussed with the
Board considerations related to regulatory deal certainty and illustrative timing to closing based on expected antitrust
and foreign investment approvals. The Board discussed with its advisors that Emerson’s proposal committed
Emerson to taking all requisite actions necessary to obtain regulatory approvals but did not include any reverse
termination fee, while Party A’s proposal included a number of significant exceptions to Party A’s commitment to
obtain regulatory approvals (including limitations on its commitments to undertake divestitures and behavioral
remedies) and contained a reverse termination fee. Mr. Starkloff and Daniel Berenbaum, NI’s Executive Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, provided an overview of financial metrics for the first quarter of 2023 along with
an update for the remainder of fiscal year 2023. BofA Securities then provided an overview of NI’s relative share price
performance compared to peers, NI’s projections compared to consensus, updated analysis including industry
trading statistics and data on select precedent transactions, including transactions in which Emerson was the
acquirer. BofA reviewed with the Board an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, highlighting key changes from
the prior analysis presented to the Board in June 2022, and a summary valuation of NI. BofA Securities also provided
an analysis of the two proposals in terms of implied equity value, implied enterprise value, implied multiples, a
preliminary discounted cash flow analysis, and a preliminary valuation summary. The members of the Board then
discussed with BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton the strategic review process they had undertaken, their
assessment of the two proposals, and potential next steps in the strategic review process. The Board and its advisors
also discussed the value offered by the two proposals as compared to NI’s standalone prospects. The Board and its
advisors believed that both Emerson and Party A could potentially offer additional value and improved contractual
terms. Following this discussion, the Board determined that both parties should be invited to submit revised
proposals. The Board instructed BofA Securities to tell Emerson and Party A that the Board was prepared to move
quickly and that they should provide revised proposals by April 10.
Following the meeting, BofA Securities contacted Emerson and Party A as directed by the Board and notified
each party that it should submit a revised proposal, putting its best foot forward on value and deal certainty by
Monday, April 10. Also on April 7, Wachtell Lipton sent DPW and Party A’s counsel revised drafts of the merger
agreement.
On April 8, 2023, Mr. Starkloff had a call with the Chief Executive Officer of Party A regarding NI’s preliminary
first quarter results.
On April 9, 2023, members of NI management and representatives of BofA Securities had a subsequent call with
Party A regarding NI’s preliminary first quarter results.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On April 10, 2023, Emerson and Party A submitted updated proposals to acquire NI. Emerson’s updated
proposal offered $57.75 per share in cash and submitted an updated draft merger agreement. Party A offered $58.50
per share in cash (and, unlike Emerson’s proposal, contained a covenant prohibiting NI from paying its regular
quarterly dividend without Party A’s consent). Party A also submitted a draft merger agreement which included a
regulatory efforts commitment that imposed significantly lesser obligations than Emerson’s and included several
limitations with respect to the level of divestiture and behavioral remedies Party A would commit to undertake in
order to secure regulatory approval of an acquisition of NI by Party A.
Following receipt of the updated proposals, on April 10, the Transaction Evaluation Committee met, with
members of the Board, members of NI management and representatives of BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in
attendance. Mr. Starkloff summarized the updated proposals for the TEC and the Board as well as his conversation
with the Chief Executive Officer of Party A over the weekend. Wachtell Lipton discussed the revised draft merger
agreements submitted by Emerson and Party A with their updated proposals. BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton
also explained that Party A’s proposed merger agreement would not permit NI to pay a regular quarterly dividend
during the period between signing and closing of a transaction, while Emerson’s draft merger agreement did allow NI
to pay a regular quarterly dividend of $0.28. The members of the TEC and the Board and the others present discussed
the implication of the ability to pay the dividend or lack thereof on the value for stockholders in a potential
transaction with Emerson as compared to a potential transaction with Party A. The Board and its advisors continued
to believe that, although Emerson and Party A had improved their offers since April 5, both Emerson and Party A
could potentially offer additional value and improved contractual terms and should be encouraged to submit “best
and final” proposals that further improved on their proposals of April 10. Following discussion, the members of the
TEC and the Board instructed BofA Securities to notify Emerson and Party A that the Board was prepared to
promptly transact with the party that could provide the most favorable proposal by the following day. Following the
meeting, BofA Securities contacted Emerson and Party A. BofA Securities expressed to both parties that they should
submit revised proposals putting forward the maximum value they were prepared to offer to acquire NI, as well as
how each should improve its contractual terms, including telling Emerson that it should offer to pay a reverse
termination fee and telling Party A that it should improve its regulatory efforts commitment as had previously been
expressed to Party A and its counsel by BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton.
On the morning of April 11, 2023, Mr. Starkloff had calls with the Chief Executive Officer of each of Emerson and
Party A and representatives of BofA Securities had a call with Party A’s financial advisors, reiterating that the Board
was prepared to transact quickly and that they should submit their “best and final” offer putting forward the
maximum price and best contractual terms they were prepared to offer.
On the afternoon of April 11, 2023, Emerson and Party A each submitted updated proposals to acquire NI.
Emerson offered to acquire NI for $59.50 per share (permitting NI to pay its regular quarterly dividend) and Party A
offered to acquire NI for $60.00 per share (and also now offered to permit NI to pay its regular quarterly dividend).
Emerson’s proposal continued to commit Emerson to take all requisite actions necessary to obtain regulatory
approvals, offered to pay a reverse termination fee, and agreed to an 18-month outside date. Party A’s proposal also
included a reverse termination fee and an 18-month outside date, but continued to have significant limitations with
respect to the level of divestiture and behavioral remedies it would commit to undertake in order to obtain regulatory
approvals. As Party A offered a slightly higher nominal price per share but continued to present less deal certainty, at
the instruction of the Chairman of the Board, and consistent with the Board’s discussion at the prior day’s meeting,
BofA Securities held further conversations with Emerson and Party A, respectively, regarding whether Emerson could
increase its price further, and whether Party A would further improve its April 11 proposal with respect to the level of
divestiture and behavioral remedies. Party A stated that no improvement on those terms was forthcoming. Later in the
afternoon of April 11, Emerson further raised its price, offering to acquire NI for $60.00 per share and submitted an
updated draft merger agreement, which included a reverse termination fee.
Later in the afternoon on April 11, 2023, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of
BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Mr. Starkloff provided an update on the developments of the past
24 hours, explaining that both parties in the strategic review process had improved their proposals to acquire NI. Mr.
Starkloff, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton described in detail the interactions on behalf of NI with Emerson and
Party A and their respective financial and legal advisors. BofA Securities described the financing commitments
proposed by each party. Wachtell Lipton described the contractual terms
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
offered by each party, which were substantially the same on various key matters, including as to NI’s ability to pay its
regular quarterly dividend without the buyer’s consent, the parties’ debt financing commitment, fiduciary-out
provisions, and the size of the termination fee. Wachtell Lipton also discussed the key contractual terms related to
regulatory approvals, including regulatory efforts, the reverse termination fee, regulatory conditions, and the end
date as well as regulatory deal certainty considerations for a transaction with each party. The Board discussed the
relative regulatory profiles of the two potential transactions and the commitments offered by each party, including
that the process for obtaining regulatory approval of a potential transaction with Emerson would likely be shorter and
provide greater certainty and fewer potential disruptions to NI’s business than the process for obtaining regulatory
approval of a potential transaction with Party A, in light of potential overlaps with Party A’s business. The Board and
Wachtell Lipton discussed that, while Emerson was willing to commit to take all requisite actions necessary to obtain
regulatory approvals, including making any and all divestitures or undertakings or behavioral commitments, Party A’s
proposed regulatory efforts commitment included meaningful limitations on behavioral remedies and divestitures.
The Board and Wachtell Lipton also discussed the circumstances in which the limitations to Party A’s efforts
obligations could lead to Party A not being obligated to close a transaction. Following discussion, the Board
determined that an acquisition of NI by Emerson would provide higher deal certainty than a potential transaction with
Party A and that such a transaction would be superior to remaining an independent company and in the best
interests of NI’s stockholders. The Board authorized management and NI’s advisors to negotiate the final transaction
details and finalize all documentation for the transaction with Emerson. The Board determined to meet the following
day to consider approving entry into a merger agreement with Emerson.
Following the meeting of the Board, Mr. Starkloff called Mr. Karsanbhai to inform him that the Board had
determined to finalize definitive agreements for an acquisition of NI by Emerson on the terms proposed.
Following the call between Mr. Starkloff and Mr. Karsanbhai, Wachtell Lipton and DPW held several calls
throughout the night, including calls with representatives from NI and Emerson, to finalize the merger agreement and
related documents ahead of an announcement in the morning.
Early on the morning of April 12, 2023, the Board met, with members of NI management and representatives of
BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. BofA Securities reviewed a brief timeline of events before and
after the launch of the strategic review process and a summary of the process. BofA Securities then presented its
financial analyses and delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, that it
was the opinion of BofA Securities, based upon and subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth in its written
opinion, that the consideration of $60.00 per share in cash to be received in the proposed merger by holders of NI’s
common stock (other than certain excluded shares as described in the merger agreement) was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Opinion of BofA
Securities, Inc.” Wachtell Lipton then described the terms of the proposed merger agreement, a summary of which
had been provided to the Board in advance of the meeting. Wachtell Lipton highlighted in particular certain terms
that had been agreed in the hours since the Board’s last meeting and also discussed the amendment to the
shareholder rights plan that would permit entry into a merger agreement with Emerson without triggering the rights
plan. Wachtell Lipton also discussed the Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with the approval of a sale of NI for
cash. Following discussion, including taking into account the factors described in greater detail in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “- Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” the Board
unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of NI and its shareholders; approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby; approved the amendment to the rights plan; resolved to recommend that NI stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement; and directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for
consideration by NI stockholders at the Special Meeting.
Following the meeting of the Board, NI and Emerson entered into the Merger Agreement early on April 12, 2023.
Before the opening of the market on April 12, 2023, NI and Emerson issued a press release announcing the
transaction.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has unanimously: (a) determined that it is in the best interests of NI and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery
and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, and (c) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of NI adopt the Merger
Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the stockholders of NI at the Special
Meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement
at the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger, the Board of Directors consulted with NI’s senior management and its independent
legal and financial advisors and considered a number of factors that the Board of Directors viewed as supporting its
decision, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
•
Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value Following a Thorough and Well Publicized Process.
The Board of Directors considered that the value of the Merger Consideration of $60.00 in cash per share
was more favorable to NI’s stockholders than the potential value that might result from other alternatives
reasonably available to NI, including the continued operation of NI on a standalone basis, in light of a
number of factors, including the following:
•
the Board of Directors’ assessment of NI’s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position
and historical and projected financial performance, the nature of the industries in which NI operates,
including recent competitive and market trends and dynamics;
•
that NI had conducted a lengthy and thorough process since the public announcement of the
strategic review process on January 13, 2023, involving outreach to potential strategic acquirers and
financial sponsors, of which seven entered into non-disclosure agreements with NI and received due
diligence, four provided first round indications of interest to acquire NI, and two provided final
proposals to acquire NI;
•
that Emerson stated that its $60.00 per share in cash proposal represented the maximum price that
Emerson could offer, following Emerson’s prior proposals offering $57.00 per share, $57.75 per share,
and $59.50 per share, respectively, and a significant increase over Emerson’s original offer to acquire
NI at $48.00 per share;
•
the course and history of NI’s discussions and negotiations with Emerson and Party A, as described
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement -
Background of the Merger,” including the fact that, after multiple rounds of negotiations, Party A was
unwilling to offer improved deal certainty in respect of regulatory terms;
•
that NI’s receptiveness to a strategic transaction was well publicized since the initiation of the
strategic review process (including through various news reports) and that NI and its financial
advisors responded to third parties who expressed interest in a possible transaction on an unsolicited
basis and who they believed were reasonably capable of consummating a transaction by offering such
third parties the opportunity to conduct due diligence and make a proposal, subject only to the
requirement that they enter into a customary confidentiality agreement; and
•
that the Board had conducted extensive deliberations over a period of three months since the
announcement of the strategic review process, to oversee and provide direction to the process, and
extensive deliberations over a period of 11 total months since Emerson’s first offer to acquire NI, to
evaluate alternatives for NI.
•
Premium. The Board of Directors considered the current and historical market prices of NI’s common stock,
including the market performance of NI common stock relative to those of other publicly traded
37TABLE OF CONTENTS
companies in NI’s sector and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $60.00
per share in cash represents a substantial premium to estimates of NI’s unaffected stock price, including a
premium of 49% to NI’s unaffected stock price of $40.17 on January 12, 2023, the day prior to NI’s
announcement of the strategic review process, and a 57% premium to NI’s 30-day volume-weighted
average share price of $38.11 as of January 12, 2023.
•
Certainty of Value. The Board of Directors considered that the proposed Merger Consideration is a fixed
cash amount, providing NI stockholders with a certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the
Closing of the Merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties, and longer potential timeline for realizing
equivalent value from NI’s standalone business plan or possible strategic alternatives. In considering the
Merger Consideration and comparing it against potential alternatives for NI, the Board of Directors
leveraged its knowledge of the business, assets, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of
NI, as well as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which NI operates, including
uncertain economic, market and capital raising conditions.
•
Negotiation Process. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement
were informed by the advice and professional experience of NI’s advisors and were the result of robust
negotiations.
•
Opinion of NI’s Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis presentation
by NI’s financial advisor, BofA Securities, and the oral opinion rendered to the Board, which was confirmed
by delivery of a written opinion dated April 12, 2023, to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the
assumptions and limitations made, the $60.00 per share in cash to be paid to holders of shares of NI
common stock (other than the Unconverted Shares) in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement - Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.” The full text of the written opinion of BofA
Securities is attached to this proxy as Annex B.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors considered the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, including:
•
the provisions allowing the Board of Directors, subject to certain conditions, to provide information in
response to, and to discuss and negotiate, certain unsolicited alternative proposals made before NI
stockholder approval of the Merger is obtained;
•
the provisions allowing the Board of Directors to change its recommendation prior to obtaining
stockholder approval of the Merger in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or
Intervening Event, subject to Parent’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment
of the termination fee of $310 million;
•
the provision allowing the Board of Directors to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions (including payment of the termination fee of $310
million and certain rights of Parent to match the Superior Proposal);
•
the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, including the number and nature of the
conditions to complete the Merger, and the provisions of the Merger Agreement requiring Parent to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger including
obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, or approvals from third
parties;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement permits NI to continue to pay to NI stockholders regular quarterly
dividends in an amount not to exceed a quarterly rate of $0.28 per share;
•
the commitment by Parent (and its subsidiaries and affiliates) to use reasonable best efforts to obtain
all necessary governmental approvals with respect to the Merger, including (i) agreeing to
divestitures, (ii) modifying contractual relationships and (iii) taking other actions that may limit
Parent’s (and its subsidiaries’ and affiliates’) freedom of action with respect to or impose obligations
on their future operations or businesses, in each case as necessary to obtain any such approval and
subject to certain limitations described in the section of this proxy statement entitled
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“The Merger Agreement - Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters,” together with the fact that
Parent agreed to pay NI a $310 million termination fee under the circumstances described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fee Payable by
Parent”; and
•
the availability of statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the Merger.
•
Opportunity for NI Stockholders to Vote. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger would
be subject to the approval of NI stockholders, and NI stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger
and vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
•
Timing of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of
the Merger and concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly
manner. The Board of Directors also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable
timeframe could reduce the period during which NI’s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty
of closing and related disruption.
•
Likelihood of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the absence of a financing condition or
similar contingency based on Emerson’s ability to obtain financing, Emerson’s committed financing, and
the strong commitment made by Emerson to obtain regulatory approvals.
•
Operating Flexibility. The fact that the Merger Agreement provides NI sufficient operating flexibility to
conduct its business in the ordinary course until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger and the
termination of the Merger Agreement, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Conduct of Business Pending the Merger”).
•
Specific Performance. NI’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific
performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent other
breaches of the Merger Agreement.
In the course of their deliberations, the Board of Directors also considered certain risks and other potentially
adverse factors concerning the Merger, including:
•
the fact that completion of the transaction depends on certain factors outside of NI’s control, including
regulatory approvals and NI stockholder approval, and that there can be no assurance that the conditions
to the transaction will be satisfied even if the Merger is approved by NI stockholders;
•
the fact that the nature of the Merger as an all-cash transaction means that NI would no longer exist as an
independent public company following the consummation of the Merger and that NI stockholders will not
participate in future earnings or growth of Emerson and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of
the Surviving Corporation;
•
the provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict NI’s ability to solicit or participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions, and that restrict NI
from entering into an alternative acquisition agreement;
•
the possibility that NI could be required under the terms of the Merger Agreement to pay a termination fee
of $310 million under certain circumstances;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger and the substantial time and effort of management required to consummate the Merger and related
disruptions to the operation of our business;
•
the potential consequences of non-consummation of the transaction, including the potential negative
impacts on NI, its business and the trading price of its shares of common stock;
•
the fact that NI’s remedies in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated may be limited to the
Parent Termination Fee of $310 million, payable by Parent under certain circumstances and certain
associated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement obligations, which may be inadequate to
compensate NI for any damage caused, and that such termination fee may not be available in all instances
where the Merger is not consummated and, even if available, such rights and remedies may be expensive
and difficult to enforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the Merger Agreement’s restrictions on the conduct of NI’s business before completion of the Merger,
generally requiring NI to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and prohibiting NI from taking certain
specified actions, which could delay or prevent NI from undertaking certain business opportunities that
arise pending completion of the Merger;
•
the fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
the failure to complete the Merger, and/or actions that NI may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to
take under the Merger Agreement could have an adverse impact on our existing and prospective business
relationships with customers and other third parties and on our employees, including the risk that certain
key members of NI’s management might choose not to remain employed with NI prior to the completion of
the Merger, regardless of whether or not the Merger is completed;
•
that the exchange of NI common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction to NI’s
stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
that some of NI’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of NI stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-
Interests of NI’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger”; and
•
other risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, see “Risk Factors” in NI’s
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, incorporated by reference herein
and the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
The Board of Directors concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the
Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to
be exhaustive but includes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Board of Directors. In view of
the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the
Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may
have given different weights to different factors. The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not
support its ultimate determination. The Board of Directors based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the
information presented, including the factors described above. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth
above is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.
NI has retained BofA Securities to act as NI’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger. BofA Securities is
an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed
and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. NI selected BofA
Securities to act as NI’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger on the basis of BofA Securities’ experience in
transactions similar to the Merger, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with NI and its
business.
On April 12, 2023, at a meeting of the Board of Directors held to evaluate the Merger, BofA Securities delivered
to the Board of Directors an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 12, 2023,
to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations
described in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of NI common stock (other than holders
of Unconverted Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion to the Board of Directors, which describes, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
entirety. The following summary of BofA Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the opinion. BofA Securities delivered its opinion to the Board of Directors for the benefit and use of the Board of
Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Merger Consideration
from a financial point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and no
opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to NI or in which NI might engage or as to the underlying business decision of
NI to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger
and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed
Merger or any related matter.
In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Securities:
(1)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to NI;
(2)
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and
prospects of NI furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the management of NI, including certain
financial forecasts relating to NI prepared by the management of NI, referred to in this section of the proxy
statement as NI management forecasts;
(3)
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of NI with members
of senior management of NI;
(4)
reviewed the trading history for NI common stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading
histories of other companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;
(5)
compared certain financial and stock market information of NI with similar information of other companies
BofA Securities deemed relevant;
(6)
compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other
transactions BofA Securities deemed relevant;
(7)
considered the fact that NI publicly announced that it would explore its strategic alternatives and the
results of BofA Securities’ efforts on behalf of NI to solicit, at the direction of NI, indications of interest and
definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of all or a portion of NI;
(8)
reviewed a draft, dated April 12, 2023, of the Merger Agreement; and
(9)
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA
Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of the management of NI that they were
not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any
material respect. With respect to the NI management forecasts, BofA Securities was advised by NI, and assumed, that
they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of
the management of NI as to the future financial performance of NI. BofA Securities did not make or was not provided
with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of NI, nor did it
make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of NI. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair
value of NI or Emerson under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.
BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of NI, that the Merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms,
without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of
obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the
Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on NI or the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
BofA Securities also assumed, at the direction of NI, that the final executed Agreement would not differ in any
material respect from the draft merger agreement reviewed by it.
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger
(other than the Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation,
the form or structure of the Merger, any related transactions or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding
entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. BofA Securities’ opinion was limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of NI common
stock (other than holders of Unconverted Shares) and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any
consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness
(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers,
directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration or
otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to
other strategies or transactions that might be available to NI or in which NI might engage or as to the underlying
business decision of NI to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities also did not express any view or
opinion with respect to, and it relied, at the direction of NI, upon the assessment of representatives of NI regarding
legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to NI or the Merger, as to which matters BofA Securities
understood that NI obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA
Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with
the Merger or any other matter.
BofA Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions
and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Securities as of, the date of its opinion.
It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and BofA Securities does not have
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities’ opinion was approved by a
fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities.
The following represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the
Board of Directors in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities. Considering the data set forth in the tables
below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses
performed by BofA Securities. 
NI Financial Analyses
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed publicly available financial and stock
market information for NI and the following 14 publicly traded companies in the test and measurement and industrial
software industries (referred to herein as selected publicly traded companies), the first two of which (referred to
herein as primary peer selected publicly traded companies), in BofA Securities’ professional judgement and
experience, were considered as primary selected publicly traded companies more similar to NI than the other selected
publicly traded companies (referred to herein as other selected test and measurement publicly traded companies and
selected industrial software publicly traded companies), in each case, when viewed as a whole with regard to
financial, operating and other characteristics, and each of which BofA Securities considered based on, among other
things, their respective end markets, operations, growth profiles and profit margins, to be relevant to BofA Securities’

BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies,
calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on April 10, 2023, plus debt and less cash and cash
equivalents, as a multiple of calendar years 2022 and 2023 estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, commonly referred to as “EBITDA,” excluding amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation
expense, restructuring costs, and one-time charges, referred to herein as “adjusted EBITDA”. BofA Securities also
reviewed per share equity values, based on closing stock prices on April 10, 2023, of the selected publicly traded
companies as a multiple of calendar years 2022 and 2023 estimated earnings per share, excluding stock-based
compensation expense, referred to herein as “adjusted EPS.” The overall median enterprise value / calendar year 2022
adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies was 16.8x, and the overall median
enterprise value / calendar year 2023 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected publicly traded
companies was 18.4x. The overall median price / calendar year 2022 adjusted EPS multiples observed for the selected
publicly traded companies was 22.4x, and the overall median price / calendar year 2023 estimated adjusted EPS
multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies was 23.3x.
Based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities then (i) applied calendar year
2022 and 2023 adjusted EBITDA multiples of 15.5x to 17.5x and 12.5x to 16.5x, respectively, derived from the primary
peer selected publicly traded companies to NI’s calendar year 2022 and 2023 estimated adjusted EBITDA of $363
million and $609 million, respectively, to determine enterprise values, from which BofA Securities subtracted net debt
as of March 31, 2023 of $380 million to calculate indicative aggregate equity values and (ii) applied calendar year 2022
and 2023 adjusted EPS multiples of 20.0x to 21.5x and 17.5x to 20.0x, respectively, derived from the primary peer
selected publicly traded companies to NI’s calendar year 2022 and 2023 estimated adjusted EPS of $1.93 and $3.30,
respectively, to determine indicative per share equity values. Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded
companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated financial data of NI were
based on the NI forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference
ranges for NI (rounded to the nearest $0.25), as compared to the Merger Consideration:

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to NI. Accordingly, an evaluation of the
results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
public trading or other values of the companies to which NI was compared.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. BofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial
information relating to the following 15 selected transactions involving companies in test and measurement and
industrial software industries (referred to herein as selected precedent transactions). Selected transactions (referred
to herein as primary selected precedent transactions), in BofA Securities’ professional
43

judgement and experience, were considered as primary selected precedent transactions more similar to NI than the
other selected precedent transactions (referred to herein as other selected precedent transactions), in each case,
when viewed as a whole as regards to financial, operating and other characteristics, and each of which BofA
Securities considered based on, among other things, their respective end markets, operations, growth profiles and
profit margins, to be relevant to BofA Securities’ analysis:

BofA Securities reviewed transaction values, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target company
based on the consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company’s (i) estimated
adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months preceding the announcement date, referred to as “LTM adjusted EBITDA”
(except with respect to the Rockwell Automation / Plex Systems transaction, for which such observed multiple was
not meaningful), and (ii) estimated adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months following the announcement date, referred to
as “NTM adjusted EBITDA” (except with respect to the Thomas H. Lee / Brooks Automation and Rockwell
Automation / Plex Systems transactions, for which such data were not available). The overall average and median
LTM adjusted EBITDA multiples for the selected transactions were 23.4x and 20.8x, respectively, and the overall
average and median NTM adjusted EBITDA multiples for the selected transactions were 20.1x and 17.4x, respectively.
Based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities then applied LTM adjusted
EBITDA and NTM adjusted EBITDA multiples of 14.5x to 22.0x and 13.0x to 17.5x, respectively, derived from the
primary selected precedent transactions to NI’s LTM adjusted EBITDA and NTM adjusted EBITDA of $424 million
and $625 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2023 to determine indicative per share equity values. Estimated
financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement
of the relevant transaction. Estimated financial data of NI were based on the NI management forecasts. This analysis
indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for NI (rounded to the nearest
$0.25) as compared to the Merger Consideration:

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to NI or the
Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business
segments or transactions to which NI and the Merger were compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of NI to calculate
the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that NI was forecasted to generate
during the second through fourth quarters of calendar year 2023 and calendar years ending December 31, 2024
through 2028 based on the NI management forecasts. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for NI by applying
perpetuity growth rates of 3.0% to 3.50%, based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience, to NI’s
estimated calendar year 2028 normalized unlevered free cash flow. The cash flows and terminal values were then
discounted to present value as of March 31, 2023, assuming a mid-year convention for cash flows, using discount
rates ranging from 8.75% to 10.75%, which were based on an estimate of NI’s weighted average cost of capital
derived using the capital asset pricing model. From the resulting enterprise values, BofA Securities subtracted net
debt as of March 31, 2023 of $380 million to derive equity values. This analysis indicated the following approximate
implied per share equity value reference ranges for NI (rounded to the nearest $0.25) as compared to the Merger
Consideration:
Implied Per Share Equity Value 
Reference Range for NI

$52.50 - $77.50

Other Factors
BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’ material
financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other
things, the following:
•
the historical trading range of NI common stock during the 12-month period ended April 10, 2023, which
was $31.02 to $42.91 per share;
•
publicly available equity research analyst price targets for NI common stock available as of January 12,
2023, which had a price target range (discounted one year by a 9.9% cost of equity) of $39.12 to $47.31 per
share; and
•
the premiums paid in selected all-cash control acquisitions of publicly traded U.S. companies with
transaction values greater than $1 billion since 2012. For each of the transactions, BofA Securities
calculated the premium represented by the offer price over the target company’s 52-week high share price
and over the target company’s unaffected share price, meaning the closing share price one day prior to the
earliest of (i) the announcement of the transaction, (ii) the target company’s announcement of a potential
transaction or that it is exploring strategic alternatives, (iii) the first reported rumor regarding the
transaction, and (iv) any other public indication that a sale transaction would likely take place (which
earliest date is referred to as the “unaffected date”). Based on this review and its professional judgment
and experience, BofA Securities applied an illustrative range of premiums derived by reference to the 25th
and 75th percentile of the observed premiums to the unaffected share price of NI common stock on January
12, 2023 of $40.17, to derive implied equity value reference ranges per share of $49.35 to $61.40.
Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion set forth above is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by
BofA Securities to the Board of Directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all
analyses undertaken by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial
opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its
analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions
of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater
weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of NI. The estimates of the future performance of
NI in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Securities’
analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the Merger Consideration and were provided to the Board of Directors in connection with the
delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a
company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the
future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis
described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’
view of the actual values of NI or its shares.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between NI
and Emerson, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Board of Directors. The decision to enter
into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board of Directors. As described above, BofA Securities’ opinion
and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board of Directors in its evaluation of the proposed
Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board of Directors or management with
respect to the Merger or the Merger Consideration.
NI has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee currently
estimated to be approximately $51 million, a portion of which was payable in connection with its opinion and a
significant portion of which is contingent upon the completion of the Merger. NI also has agreed to reimburse BofA
Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA
Securities, any of its affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents and each other
person controlling BofA Securities or any of its affiliates against specified liabilities.

While NI has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, NI does not, as a matter of
course, otherwise publicly disclose internal projections as to future performance, earnings, or other results beyond
the then-current annual period due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial
performance for future periods and the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, in the ordinary course, NI management prepares a long-term strategic plan, which is periodically
updated and reviewed with the Board, that reflects NI management’s financial and business outlook for NI. In
connection with the proposed Merger, NI is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited
prospective financial information of NI, on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Merger, prepared by NI
management, solely because, as described below, certain financial information was given to the Board in connection
with its consideration and evaluation of the Merger and to BofA Securities for its use and reliance in connection with
the financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Board and BofA Securities’ opinion as discussed in “-
Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.”
In June 2022, in connection with the Board’s evaluation of Emerson’s initial proposal to acquire NI, NI
management prepared certain unaudited, preliminary financial forecasts for NI for fiscal years 2022 through 2025,
which NI management also extrapolated through fiscal year 2028 (the “June 2022 Projections”) in connection with
BofA Securities’ preliminary financial analysis of Emerson’s initial proposal.
In December 2022, in connection with the Board’s evaluation of Emerson’s updated proposal and consideration
of initiating a strategic review process, NI management updated the projections and extrapolations to take into
account changes in the internal and external business environment, including updates to NI’s component supply
chain and general economic environment as well as efficiency savings in operating expense (the “December 2022
Projections”).
In February 2023, NI management made updates to the projections and extrapolations in the December 2022
Projections related to depreciation and amortization and taxes (the “February 2023 Projections”). The Board reviewed
the February 2023 Projections and BofA Securities used the February 2023 Projections in connection with the Board’s
evaluation and BofA Securities’ financial analysis of the updated proposals to acquire NI, including Emerson’s final
proposal to acquire NI. The February 2023 Projections (but not the unlevered free cash flow) were also made available
to participants in the strategic review process in connection with the management presentations.
The June 2022 Projections, the December 2022 Projections, and the February 2023 Projections are referred to
collectively as the “Company Projections.” NI is including a summary of the Company Projections to provide NI
stockholders with access to information that was made available to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the
Merger and the Merger Consideration.
June 2022 Projections
NI management prepared the June 2022 Projections with respect to NI’s business, as a standalone company, for
the second through fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2028, except that, at the direction of NI
management, unlevered free cash flow was arithmetically calculated by BofA Securities solely using the prospective
financial information included in the June 2022 Projections, which calculation was reviewed and approved by NI
management for BofA Securities’ reliance and use in connection with the preliminary financial analysis presented by
BofA Securities to the Board at the June 14, 2022 meeting.

Important Information Regarding the Company Projections
The inclusion of the Company Projections or of this summary does not constitute an admission or
representation by NI, BofA Securities, or any other person that the information is material, should not be regarded as
an indication that the Board, BofA Securities, NI or its management, or any other recipient of this information
considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of
future results, and they should not be relied on as such. This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as
indicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
the Company Projections.
The Company Projections include non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
Diluted Earnings Per Share and Unlevered Free Cash Flow. Please see the tables above for a description of how NI
defines these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of the Company Projections in this section. Non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented
in accordance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures used by NI may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies.
The Company Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were based
are subjective in many respects and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the
dynamics of NI’s industry and based on actual experience and business developments. The Company Projections,
while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to Company performance,
industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters,
many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond NI’s
control. The Company Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of
significant risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-
Looking Statements,” that could cause the Company Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and
for actual results to differ materially from the Company Projections. As a result, there can be no assurance that the
Company Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected, and
the Company Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon
as such. Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable
with each successive year. The Company Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring
after the date on which they were prepared, including the Merger, and some or all of the assumptions that have been
made in connection with the preparation of the Company Projections may have changed since the date the Company
Projections were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an
additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be
achieved.
In addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the
date the Company Projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of NI, Emerson or any of
our or their respective affiliates intends to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update or otherwise revise
the Company Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when
made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to
be in error (except, in the case of NI, as required by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken
into account in reviewing the Company Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the Special Meeting will be held several months after the
Company Projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of
this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the Company Projections set forth below.
The Company Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and
other information contained in NI’s public filings with the SEC. NI urges all of its stockholders to
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
review its most recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial results. See the section of this proxy
statement entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
The Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure or
toward compliance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of
the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and
presentation of prospective financial information. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (“Ernst & Young”), NI’s independent
registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled, or performed any
procedures with respect to the Company Projections and, accordingly, neither Ernst & Young nor any other
accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young report
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to NI’s historical financial information. It does not extend to
the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.
None of NI or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any
representation to any NI stockholder or to Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning
the Company Projections or regarding NI’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the
Company Projections or that the projected results will be achieved.
Interests of NI’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that NI stockholders approve the transaction and
vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, NI
stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of NI have certain interests in the transactions
that are or may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of NI stockholders generally. The Board of Directors
was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by it, including the Merger, and in making their recommendation that NI stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement.
These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative below,
including compensation that may become payable in connection with the Merger to NI’s named executive officers
(which is the subject of an advisory (nonbinding) vote of NI stockholders). For more information, please see the
section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 2: The Compensation Proposal.” The dates used below to quantify
these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only in accordance with SEC rules and do not necessarily
reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.
For purposes of this disclosure, NI’s named executive officers are:
•
Eric H. Starkloff - President and Chief Executive Officer
•
Daniel Berenbaum - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
•
Scott A. Rust - Executive Vice President, Global Operations
•
Ritu Favre - Executive Vice President & GM, Business Units
•
Karen M. Rapp - Former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
•
Jason E. Green - Former Executive Vice President & GM, Portfolio BU and Chief Revenue Officer 
For purposes of this disclosure, NI’s executive officers consist of its named executive officers and Thomas
Benjamin (Executive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer and Head of Platform and Product Analytics).
Treatment of NI Equity Awards
At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is vested or vests by its terms upon the Effective Time or is held by a non-employee director or former service
provider of NI (whether vested or unvested) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash, subject to applicable withholding, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares of NI common stock subject to such Company RSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each other Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into an Emerson RSU with the same terms and conditions as applied to
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Emerson common stock
underlying the Emerson RSU equal to the product, rounded to the nearest whole share, of (a) the number of shares of
NI common stock underlying the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio.
At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is vested or vests by its terms upon the Effective Time or is held by a non-employee director or former service
provider of NI (whether vested or unvested) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash, subject to applicable withholding, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares of NI common stock subject to such Company PSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming that performance was achieved at the target level if the applicable
performance period has not been completed at or prior to the Effective Time). Each other Company PSU that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into an Emerson RSU with the same terms
and conditions as applied to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any performance-
based vesting conditions), with the number of shares of Emerson common stock underlying the Emerson RSU equal
to the product, rounded to the nearest whole share, of (a) the number of shares of NI common stock underlying the
Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming that performance was achieved at the target level if
the applicable performance period has not been completed at or prior to the Effective Time) and (b) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio.
Under NI’s equity incentive plans (other than the 2010 Incentive Plan), the vesting of awards assumed or
substituted by an acquirer in a change in control would accelerate in full if the holder’s employment was terminated
without cause within 24 months following the change in control (i.e., double-trigger). Under NI’s 2010 Incentive Plan,
the vesting of outstanding awards would be immediately accelerated upon a change in control (i.e., single-trigger).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, NI may amend the terms of any equity awards that do not vest upon the Effective
Time to provide that such awards will fully vest upon the holder’s termination of employment without cause, for good
reason or due to death or disability, in each case generally within 24 months following the Effective Time (i.e., double-
trigger).
For an estimate of the value of unvested equity awards that would vest assuming that the Merger occurs on
May 10, 2023, and each of the named executive officers experiences a termination without cause on that date, see “-
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to NI’s Named Executive Officers” below. We estimate that the value of
unvested equity awards held by Mr. Benjamin that would vest assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 10,
2023 and that he experiences a termination without cause on that date is $3,571,020, calculated based on the Merger
Consideration of $60 per share. We estimate that the aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by all non-
employee directors of NI that would vest assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 10, 2023 is $1,561,980,
calculated based on the Merger Consideration of $60 per share.
Executive Employment Agreements
NI is party to an employment agreement with each of its executive officers (other than Ms. Rapp and Mr. Green).
Effective January 9, 2023, Mr. Berenbaum replaced Ms. Rapp as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
and Ms. Rapp transitioned to a strategic advisor role pursuant to a continued employment offer letter that does not
provide any severance payments or benefits. Mr. Green, former Executive Vice President & GM, Portfolio BU and
Chief Revenue Officer, departed NI effective December 31, 2022.
Under the employment agreements, in the event of a termination without cause or for good reason within 3
months prior to or 12 months following a change in control, the executive generally would be entitled to the following
severance benefits: (a) 1x (or 1.5x in the case of Mr. Starkloff) the executive’s annual base salary, paid in a lump-sum
on the 60th day following termination; (b) 100% of the executive’s annual bonus then in effect (to the extent not
already earned and accrued), paid when annual bonuses are paid to other NI senior executives; (c) accelerated
vesting of outstanding service-based restricted stock unit awards that would have vested had the executive remained
employed for 12 months following termination (equity awards also would be subject to the double-trigger change-in-
control vesting provisions under the applicable equity plan as described above); and (d) reimbursement or payment
of COBRA premiums (at the coverage level in effect immediately prior to the executive’s termination) for 12 months (or
18 months in the case of Mr. Starkloff) following termination or until the executive becomes covered under similar
plans, if earlier. The foregoing severance payments and benefits are generally subject to the executive’s execution
and nonrevocation of a release of claims and compliance with NI’s proprietary rights agreement containing restrictive
covenants.
51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
For an estimate of the value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to
NI’s named executive officers assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 10, 2023 and that the executive
experiences a termination without cause on that date, see “- Quantification of Payments and Benefits to NI’s Named
Executive Officers” below. We estimate that the value of severance payments and benefits (other than equity awards,
which are quantified separately) that would be payable to Mr. Benjamin, assuming that the Effective Time occurs on
May 10, 2023 and that the executive experiences a termination without cause on that date, is $850,000 in cash
severance and $20,000 in reimbursement or payment of COBRA premiums.
Section 280G and 4999 of the Code
Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements with each of our executive officers (other than Ms. Rapp
and Mr. Green, who are not party to such agreements), if payments to an executive under his or her employment
agreement (or otherwise) would be subject to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (as defined in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “- Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), such payments would
be reduced to the extent the executive would be better off after taxes.
To the extent the Effective Time is not reasonably expected to occur in 2023, in consultation with Parent, NI may
take any of the following actions in order to mitigate the effects, if any, of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code: (i)
accelerate the vesting and payment into 2023 of (A) 2023 annual bonuses and (B) unvested equity awards which are
scheduled to vest in the first half of 2024, (ii) accelerate the vesting or payment of compensation that would vest or
become payable at the Effective Time, (iii) enter into non-competition agreements or (iv) pay out accrued vacation in
2023. Any amounts accelerated will be subject to repayment in the event the executive does not meet the applicable
original vesting conditions with respect to such amounts.
Retention Awards
In connection with the Merger, Mr. Berenbaum has been granted a cash retention award in the amount of
$100,000, which is payable, subject to continued service, 50% upon the Effective Time and 50% on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (or, in the case of the second installment, upon an earlier termination of employment
without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability, subject to the recipient’s execution and nonrevocation of
a release of claims).
Annual Bonus for Year of Closing
If the Effective Time occurs in 2023 or following March 1, 2024, Parent will pay to each eligible NI employee
(including each executive officer) an annual bonus in respect of the year of Closing at the same time NI historically
paid annual bonuses, based on (x) the greater of 75% of target performance and actual performance (as determined by
NI) in respect of the period elapsed in such year prior to the Effective Time and (y) actual performance (as determined
by Parent) in respect of the period remaining in such year following the Effective Time, subject to the applicable
employee’s continued employment through the payment date or upon his or her earlier termination of employment
after the Closing without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability (if termination occurs in the year of
Closing, the amount will be prorated based on the number of days elapsed in the year through such termination).
Indemnification Insurance
NI’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period
of six years following the effective time under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from the Surviving
Corporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Indemnification and Insurance.”
New Compensation Arrangements
Any executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained
to provide services to the Surviving Corporation may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and
may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent, any of its affiliates or the
Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation arrangements between such persons
and the Surviving Corporation and/or its affiliates have been established or discussed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to NI’s Named Executive Officers
The table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of NI’s named executive officers
would receive in connection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such named
executive officer experienced a termination without cause on May 10, 2023 (which is the assumed date of the
consummation of the Merger solely for purposes of this disclosure); and (ii) a per share price of NI common stock of
$60, which is the per share merger consideration. The calculations in the table below do not attempt to forecast any
adjustments in compensation that may occur following the date of this proxy statement, including additional awards,
grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time or any awards that, by their terms, vest irrespective of
the Merger prior to the Effective Time. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur
or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual
amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

The cash amounts payable to the named executive officers (other than Ms. Rapp and Mr. Green) under the employment
agreements consist of the following components:
(a)
A cash severance payment equal to 1x (or 1.5x in the case of Mr. Starkloff) annual base salary then in effect, paid in a
lump-sum on the 60th day following a qualifying termination; and
(b)
An amount equal to 100% of the annual bonus then in effect (to the extent not already earned and accrued), paid when
annual bonuses are paid to other NI senior executives.
All components of the cash amounts are “double-trigger” (i.e., they are contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment
in connection with the closing of the Merger) and are subject to the named executive officer’s execution and nonrevocation of a
release of claims and compliance with restrictive covenants. While the cash severance payment is paid as a lump sum in the
event the named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment during the 3 months prior to or the 12
months following the Merger, the named executive officers remain eligible pursuant to their employment agreements to receive
these same cash benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment outside such window, in which case, the cash component
will be paid in installments over the 12-month (or 18-month period in the case of Mr. Starkloff) following termination of
employment, and the annual bonus will be paid when bonuses are normally paid to senior executives of NI. The estimated
amounts of each component of the cash payments are set forth in the table below. For a more detailed description of the
payment terms of the cash amounts, see “- Executive Employment Agreements” above.

Financing of the Merger
Parent intends to fund the Merger with the Climate Proceeds. At the request of NI in order to provide certainty
of funds for the Merger, Parent has entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”), dated as of April 12,
2023, with Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (collectively, the “Commitment
Parties”), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have committed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured bridge
loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $8.175 billion (the “Bridge Facility”), to fund the consideration
for the Merger. The Bridge Facility is subject to customary reduction and prepayment terms, including reduction or
prepayment with the Climate Proceeds. The funding of the Bridge Facility provided for in the Commitment Letter is
contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions, including (i) the execution and delivery of definitive
documentation with respect to the Bridge Facility and (ii) the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the
Merger Agreement.
Parent agrees to keep the Commitment Letter in place unless Parent receives the proceeds from the Climate
Transaction (or the bridge commitments are otherwise terminated pursuant to the mandatory reduction terms of the
Commitment Letter). In the event that the bridge commitments will be taken out by a term loan (in lieu of the Climate
Proceeds), Parent agrees to use reasonable best efforts to sign a credit agreement with respect to the term loan
takeout as promptly as possible after the Syndication Commencement Date (as defined in the Commitment Letter as
of the date of the Merger Agreement), which will be the earlier of (x) June 12, 2023 and (y) a date notified to Parent in
writing by Goldman Sachs Bank USA and receipt of the Financing Information (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
If any such credit agreements are signed, Parent will be required to deliver those documents to NI.",56,63

Appraisal Rights
This section summarizes Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. The
following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Delaware law and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which may be accessed without subscription or
cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that you exercise your appraisal rights under Section 262.
Any person contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should carefully review the provisions of
Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262), particularly the procedural steps required to properly
demand and perfect such rights. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for demanding and perfecting
appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to
a (i) “stockholder” are to the record holder of NI common stock, (ii) “beneficial owner” are to a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of NI common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person,
and (iii) “person” are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity.
Under Section 262, stockholders and beneficial owners desiring to exercise their right to appraisal must (1)
properly deliver a written demand for an appraisal of their shares of NI common stock to NI prior to the stockholder
vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement; (3) hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of NI common stock upon the
making of a demand under clause (1) and continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, such shares of NI
common stock through the Effective Time; (4) not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares or
otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL; and (5) otherwise meet the criteria
and follow the procedures set forth in Section 262. However, assuming the shares of NI common stock remain listed
on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal
petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders and
beneficial owners of NI common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of
shares of NI common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of NI common stock eligible
for appraisal or (y) the value of the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement in respect of
such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000. We refer to these conditions as the “Minimum Conditions.”
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest
from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly
and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment; provided,
however, that at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the
Surviving Corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such
interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and
(2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving
Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons
considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the
Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for approval and adoption at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of the stockholders
55TABLE OF CONTENTS
who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are
available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or information directing the
stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription
or cost. This proxy statement constitutes such notice that appraisal rights are available in connection with the
Merger, and the full text of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online
(available at https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). In connection with the Merger, any
person who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such person’s right to do so should review
Section 262 carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result
in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to
seek appraisal, we believe that if a person considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of
legal counsel.
Stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of NI
common stock must strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. In addition, a stockholder of record, a beneficial
owner or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination
of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is
under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights
should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not
vote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank, broker or other nominee regarding
methods of voting.
Filing Written Demand
Any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to us, before the vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person’s
shares. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for
appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s
failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the
Special Meeting may constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Record Holders
A demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must
reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal
of the stockholder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If a holder of record is submitting a demand with respect
to shares owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such
demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares are owned of record
by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may
execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or
owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or
owners. A holder of record, such as a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of NI common
stock as nominee or intermediary for one or more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to
shares of NI common stock held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising appraisal rights for other
beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of NI common stock as to
which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of NI common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will
be presumed to cover all shares of NI common stock held in the name of the holder of record.
Beneficial Owners
A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares
in accordance with the procedures of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 summarized above, provided that (i) such
beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the Effective Time and otherwise satisfies the
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262, and (ii) the demand
made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made,
is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement
that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at
which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by NI under Section 262 and to be set forth on the
Verified List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Actions After Completion of the Merger”).
Although not expressly required by Section 262, NI reserves the right to take the position that it may require the
submission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 with respect to
any person sharing beneficial ownership of the shares for which such demand is submitted. All written demands for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to: Secretary, National Instruments Corporation,
11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759. Demands for appraisal may not be submitted by electronic
transmission.
Actions After Completion of the Merger
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each
holder of NI common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not
voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and any beneficial owner who has properly demanded
appraisal as of the Effective Time, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person’s demand
for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares and accept the Merger Consideration offered pursuant
to the Merger Agreement with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal by delivering to us as the Surviving
Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262,
may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on
the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all our stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving
Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and no person should assume that
the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of
NI common stock. Accordingly, any stockholders or beneficial owners who desire to have their shares appraised
should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of NI common stock
within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of
shares of NI common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could result in the loss of
appraisal rights. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any person who has complied with the requirements for
exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or
beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his,
her or its own behalf, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such
shares for purposes of such aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the
requesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or
within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of NI common stock or a beneficial owner
and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within
20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the
“Verified List”) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and
with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be
mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the Verified List at the addresses stated
therein. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
and the costs of these notices shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to
conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons who have complied with Section 262 and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons who
demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that direction, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
In addition, assuming the NI common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all persons who are
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the Minimum Conditions is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair
value” of the shares of NI common stock subject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to
be the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL that have the effect of limiting the sum on which
interest accrues as described above).
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather
applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,
the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of NI common stock as
so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger
Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of NI common
stock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger
Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner
address, “fair value” under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration offered
pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering exercising appraisal rights should recognize
that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger
Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Neither NI nor Parent anticipates offering more than the
Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any holder or beneficial owner of shares of NI
common stock exercising appraisal rights, and NI and Parent each reserve the right to make a voluntary cash payment
pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes
of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of NI common stock is less than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant
to the Merger Agreement. If a demand for appraisal is duly withdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not timely filed,
neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the NI common stock remained listed on a national securities
exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time) or other requirements imposed by Section 262 to perfect and seek
appraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an appraisal will cease.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Verified List may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262.
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if
any, by the Surviving Corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon
such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree
may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of
experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the
Verified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’
fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal
not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of
jurisdiction under Subsection (k) of Section 262. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of NI common stock under Section 262 fails to
perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of NI common
stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement, without interest. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or
withdraw, such person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time,
neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the NI common stock remained listed on a national securities
exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time) or if the person delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written
withdrawal of the person’s demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
From and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of
such person’s shares of NI common stock will be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment
of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of
record as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the Minimum
Conditions is met (assuming the NI common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior
to the Effective Time), or if the person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to the Surviving Corporation a
written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares within 60 days
after the Effective Time in accordance with Section 262, then the right of such person to an appraisal of such shares
will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, no appraisal
proceeding shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without
limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware Court of Chancery made under subsection
(j) of Section 262; provided that this sentence does not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand in respect of
some or all of such person’s shares and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger with respect to the shares
subject to the withdrawal within 60 days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a
stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder or beneficial owner
wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS CORP_20230525_DEFM14A_20911673_4672792.Pdf,Litigation Related to the Merger,"Litigation Related to the Merger
In connection with the Merger Agreement, a complaint has been filed in federal court as an individual action.
The complaint is captioned as O'Dell v. National Instruments Corporation, et al., 23-cv-04189 (filed May 19, 2023 in
the Southern District of New York) (which we refer to as the “Complaint”).
The Complaint alleges that the preliminary proxy statement filed by NI on May 11, 2023 in connection with the
Merger Agreement (the “Preliminary Proxy”) misrepresents and/or omits certain purportedly material information. The
Complaint asserts violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder
against NI and the members of the Board of Directors. The Complaint seeks, among other things: (i) an injunction
enjoining the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii)
rescission or rescissory damages in the event the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement are consummated; (iii) direction that defendants account for all damages suffered as a result of any
wrongdoing; (iv) costs of the action, including plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and experts' fees; and (v) other relief the

court may deem just and proper. In addition to the Complaint, starting on May 18, 2023, purported stockholders of NI
sent demand letters (which we refer to as the “Demands,” and together with the Complaint, as the “Matters”) alleging

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
that may be relevant to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of shares of NI common stock whose shares of NI common
stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders
who hold their shares of NI common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to, as amended, as the “Code”) (generally, property held for
investment). This discussion does not address U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other
than U.S. Holders. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code,
rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and judicial
decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect
the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS
would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax considerations described in
this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of counsel has been or
will be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of NI common stock that is
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless
of its source; or
•
a trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration
of such trust and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United
States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of
the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts
and circumstances, or to NI stockholders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for
example:
•
banks and other financial institutions;
•
mutual funds;
•
insurance companies;
•
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
•
traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to shares of NI
common stock;
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
•
retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
•
tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations
and pension funds;
60TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
holders that hold shares of NI common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or other
integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
•
U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S
corporations,” or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such
entities);
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of NI common stock (by
vote or value);
•
holders that received their shares of NI common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-
qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
holders that own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger;
•
holders subject to any applicable minimum tax;
•
holders exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL; and
•
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to NI common
stock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.
This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income
tax (such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income or non-income
tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising under the unearned
income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or any
considerations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations
and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant
thereto or in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such
agreement).
If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of
shares of NI common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will
depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations
made at the partner level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships holding shares of NI common
stock, and any partners therein, should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the
Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY
PARTICULAR NI STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE NI STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX
CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,
INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of NI common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.
Holder who receives cash in exchange for NI common stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in the Merger and the U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of NI common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted
tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of NI common stock. Any gain or
loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than
one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders,
including individuals, currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of NI common stock at different times or
different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to
each block of NI common stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders in
connection with the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S.
Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly
completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct taxpayer identification number and
certifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and
otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S.
Holder may be refunded or credited against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX
CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY
STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS

General
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement) use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, and to do
promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals, registrations,
waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from governmental entities as described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement - Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.”
These approvals include clearances under the HSR Act and regulatory approvals under the laws of certain other
jurisdictions.
U.S. Regulatory Clearances
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger
under HSR Act has expired or been terminated and any and all agreements with governmental entities with competent
jurisdiction over NI or Parent pursuant to which such parties have agreed not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement until a specified time has expired, been terminated or been waived. A
transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration or termination of a 30-day waiting
period following the parties’ filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade Commission
(which we refer to as the “FTC”) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the
“DOJ”) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a “Second
Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting
period, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless
the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. The parties made
the required filings with the FTC and the DOJ on April 26, 2023.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could
take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could
include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.
Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be
certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
62TABLE OF CONTENTS
Other Regulatory Clearances
The Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions (unless
excluded by waiver mutually agreed between the parties to the Merger Agreement) under their applicable regulatory
laws as amended from time to time.
In each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to consummate the
Merger or the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have agreed to cooperate with
each other and use their reasonable best efforts to make these filings as promptly as practicable. The relevant
regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or
desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold
separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of NI common stock entitled to vote
thereon is required for approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting, (b)
abstentions and (c) “broker non-votes” (if any) will each have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Agreement Proposal. Shares of NI common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked
proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If an NI stockholder returns a signed
proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of NI common stock represented by
that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting,
and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

limitations and supplemental information agreed to by NI, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating
the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the
Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between NI, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to
establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from

NI Common Stock
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of NI, Parent, Merger Sub, or
the holders of any securities of NI or Merger Sub, each share of NI common stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (a) each share held by any subsidiary of either NI or Parent (other than Merger Sub)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in NI immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (b) each share that is owned by NI as treasury stock or otherwise (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under any of the Company Equity Plans or the Company
ESPP) or held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be cancelled and will cease
to exist, and (c) shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares
described in (a) and (b)) and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of
such shares, as applicable, pursuant to, and who have properly exercised and perfected their demands for appraisal
rights under and comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to, collectively, as the
“Unconverted Shares”)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $60.00 in cash (which we refer to as
the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any required tax withholding.
Treatment of NI Equity Awards
At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is vested or vests by its terms upon the Effective Time or is held by a non-employee director or former service
provider of NI (whether vested or unvested) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash, subject to applicable withholding, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares of NI common stock subject to such Company RSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each other Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into an Emerson RSU with the same terms and conditions as applied to such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Emerson common stock
underlying the Emerson RSU equal to the product, rounded to the nearest whole share, of (a) the number of shares of
NI common stock underlying the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio.
At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is vested or vests by its terms upon the Effective Time or is held by a non-employee director or former service
provider of NI (whether vested or unvested) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash, subject to applicable withholding, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the total number of shares of NI common stock subject to such Company PSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming that performance was achieved at the target level if the applicable
performance period has not been completed at or prior to the Effective Time). Each other Company PSU that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into an Emerson RSU with the same terms
and conditions as applied to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any performance-
based vesting conditions), with the number of shares of Emerson common stock underlying the Emerson RSU equal
to the product, rounded to the nearest whole share, of (a) the number of shares of NI common stock underlying the

No later than the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust
company that will be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and reasonably approved in advance by NI in
writing (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and NI) (which we refer
to as the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of holders of the shares of NI common stock, cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the shares of NI common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares described in clauses (a) and (b) of the
definition of Unconverted Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of NI common stock (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
noncertificated shares of NI common stock represented by book-entry (which we refer to such cash as the “Payment
Fund”). In the event that the Payment Fund has insufficient funds to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent will
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the
shortfall that is required to make such payment.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second business
day following the Closing Date, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal (which will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to certificates will pass, only upon delivery of
certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares to the Paying Agent and will be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and NI may mutually reasonably agree), and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-
entry shares to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares
represented by such holder’s properly surrendered certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-
entry shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares that is not registered in the transfer records of NI, payment of the Merger Consideration upon
due surrender of a certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the certificate formerly representing such shares is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. In the case of any certificate of
NI common stock that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate a check in the
amount of the number of shares of NI common stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration.
Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of shares of NI common stock that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration on the first anniversary of the Effective Time will thereafter be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of such Shares who have not surrendered their
66TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of NI common stock must thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their shares of NI common stock. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of NI common stock that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity) will become, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

The Paying Agent, NI, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable under the Merger Agreement such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or under any provision of
applicable state, local or foreign tax law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are

During the Pre-Closing Period, NI has agreed that it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors and officers not to, and has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the making or submission of any proposal,
offer or indication of intent that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an
Alternative Proposal (as defined below in this section of this proxy statement);

organizational and other governing documents;
•
approve any transaction under, or any person becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of
the DGCL or NI’s organizational and other governing documents; or
•
resolve to do any of the foregoing.
NI has agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their officers, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives (which we refer to, collectively, as
“Representatives”) to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any third party and its Representatives conducted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement with
respect to any Alternative Proposal. NI agreed to promptly (and in any event within five business days of the date of
the Merger Agreement) request that each third party that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the 24-
month period prior to the date of the Merger Agreement in connection with its consideration of any Alternative
Proposal return or destroy all confidential information pursuant to such confidentiality agreement furnished to such
person by or on behalf of NI or any of its subsidiaries, and NI agreed to confirm to Parent the receipt of all
certifications of such return or destruction from such other persons as promptly as practicable after such receipt
thereof. NI agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to secure all such certifications as promptly as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the NI
stockholders, if NI receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal, NI and its Representatives may contact the third
party making such Alternative Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof. If (i) such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below in this section of this proxy statement) or (ii) the Board of Directors
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors that such Alternative Proposal
would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, NI may, so long as it has otherwise complied with the
non-solicitation obligations set forth above in all material respects, take the following actions to the extent failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the Board of Director’s fiduciary duties under applicable law (and the Board of
Director determines the same in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel):
•
furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Alternative Proposal (including its
Representatives and prospective equity and debt financing sources), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing
such information, (i) the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with NI (a copy of which will
be provided for informational purposes only to Parent) having provisions as to confidential treatment of
information that are not materially less restrictive in the aggregate to such third party than the
confidentiality provisions in Parent’s confidentiality agreement are to Parent (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement (1) need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit
the making or amendment of any Alternative Proposal and (2) will not prohibit NI from providing any
information contemplated by this paragraph to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives) and
(ii) NI promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provides Parent any such nonpublic information to the
extent access to such information was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives; and
•
engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including its Representatives) with respect to
such Alternative Proposal.
NI has agreed to promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if any inquiries (including
any written request for information relating to NI or any of its subsidiaries), proposals or offers with respect to an
Alternative Proposal are received by NI or any of its Representatives, which notice must identify the third party
making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Alternative Proposal, and, after taking such action, NI has
agreed to continue to promptly advise Parent on a reasonably current basis of the status and terms of any material
discussions with respect to any such Alternative Proposal and promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided to NI or any of its
subsidiaries that describes any material terms or conditions of any such Alternative Proposal. Any material
amendment to any Alternative Proposal will be deemed to be a new Alternative Proposal for purposes of NI’s
compliance with this and the foregoing paragraph.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Alternative Proposal” means any bona fide proposal, offer or indication of intent made by any person or group
of persons (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates) for, or that would result in (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving
NI or one or more subsidiaries thereof whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of NI and its subsidiaries, in each case, as a result of which the stockholders of NI or such
subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction would cease to own at least 75% of the total voting power of NI or
such subsidiaries or the surviving entity (or any direct or indirect parent company thereof), as applicable, immediately
following such transaction, (ii) the acquisition by any person of more than 25% of the net revenues, net income or
total assets of NI and its subsidiaries, in each case, on a consolidated basis, (iii) the acquisition by any person of
more than 25% of the outstanding shares of NI common stock or any other class of equity or voting securities of one
or more subsidiaries thereof whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of NI and its subsidiaries; or (iv) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any such persons beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of NI or one or more subsidiaries thereof whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
25% or more of the consolidated assets of NI and its subsidiaries.
“Superior Proposal” means an unsolicited, written Alternative Proposal, made after the date of the Merger
Agreement, substituting in the definition thereof “50%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase
appears, that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with NI’s outside legal and financial
advisors, and consistent with the Board of Director’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, to be more favorable to
NI’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and which is reasonably capable of
being consummated on the terms proposed (after taking into account any changes thereto committed to by Parent).

recommendation that NI stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
fail to include the recommendation that NI stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement in this proxy

acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders;

At any time prior to obtaining the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the NI stockholders, the Board of
Directors may make a Change of Recommendation, or, in certain specified circumstances, terminate the Merger
Agreement, provided, that the Board of Directors will not be entitled to make a Change of Recommendation or cause
any such termination of the Merger Agreement:
•
unless NI has given Parent at least five business days’ written notice (which we refer to as a “Superior
Proposal Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such Change of Recommendation or terminate
the Merger Agreement, which notice must include a description of the terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the Board of Directors, the identity of the person
making the Superior Proposal and a true and complete copy of any proposed definitive agreement for such
Superior Proposal, if any, and NI has negotiated in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) to enable Parent to make such amendments to the terms of the Merger Agreement as would
permit the Board of Directors not to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger
Agreement in connection with such Superior Proposal; and
•
unless, at the end of the five-business day period following the receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice,
after taking into account any firm commitments made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of the Merger
Agreement during such period and in consultation with outside legal counsel and its independent financial
advisor, the Board of Directors concludes that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal
Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if such amendments were to be given effect; provided,
that any material modifications to the terms of the Superior Proposal will commence a new notice period of
three business days.
At any time prior to obtaining the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the NI stockholders, the Board of
Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in this section of this proxy statement), withdraw,

unless:
•
NI has given Parent at least four business days’ written notice (which we refer to as “Intervening Event
Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such an Change of Recommendation, which Intervening
Event Notice must include a reasonably detailed description of the applicable Intervening Event, and NI
has negotiated in good faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to enable Parent to
propose such amendments to the terms of the Merger Agreement as would permit the Board of Directors
not to effect such a Change of Recommendation in connection with such Intervening Event; and
•
unless, at the end of the four-business day period following the delivery of such Intervening Event Notice,
after taking into account any firm commitments made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of the Merger
Agreement during such period, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with NI’s
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such Change in Recommendation
would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law if
such amendments were to be given effect; provided, that any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event will commence a new notice period of three business
days.
Nothing in the Merger Agreement will prevent the Board of Directors from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable law or rules and policies of NASDAQ or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement
pending disclosure of its position thereunder.
“Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development that materially affects the business

For one year following the Effective Time, Parent will provide or cause to be provided to each employee of NI
and its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or any of its affiliates (each of whom we refer to as a
“Continuing Employee”):
•
base compensation and target annual cash incentive opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable
than were provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
•
equity incentive opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its subsidiaries, as applicable, following the Effective Time; and
•
employee benefits (excluding any equity or equity based compensation, employee stock purchase benefits,

to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In addition, Parent will provide or cause to be provided to each Continuing Employee who incurs a qualifying
termination of employment during the one-year period following the Effective Time with severance benefits equal to
the greater of (x) severance benefits generally consistent with NI’s existing severance practices, and (y) severance

However, any Continuing Employees who, at any time during the one-year period following the Effective Time,
are or become covered by a collective bargaining agreement will solely be provided with compensation, benefits and

health and welfare benefits to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the corresponding NI employee benefit plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated and (c) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is

Unless the Commitment Letter is terminated pursuant to a Permitted Termination and until such time, in the event
that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent has agreed to (i)
promptly notify NI in writing of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) use reasonable best efforts, and

otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any

any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including
acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of NI or its subsidiaries).
For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, and
the Surviving Corporation will, either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’,
employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of NI and its subsidiaries and
their respective current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for NI and its subsidiaries and
their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’,
employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of NI and
its subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by or for the benefit of NI and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors

respect to directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event will
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by NI and its subsidiaries. If the Surviving Corporation is unable to
obtain such insurance because its cost exceeds such maximum amount, it will obtain as much comparable insurance
as possible for the years within such six-year period for a premium equal to such maximum amount. In lieu of such
insurance, prior to the Closing Date NI may, at its option, or Parent may, at its option request NI to, purchase a six-
year prepaid “tail” directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance policy for NI and its
subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’
and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iii) strategy for the defense and
settlement of any action brought by or before any governmental entity that has authority to enforce the applicable

compromise or offer to settle or compromise any request, inquiry, investigation or other action by a governmental
entity with respect to the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement without the prior
written consent of Parent (which may be withheld or given in its sole discretion). Notwithstanding anything to the

into any agreement with any governmental entity to delay, or otherwise not to consummate as promptly as
practicable, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement except with the prior written
consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
With respect to the required regulatory approvals, the parties have agreed that the reasonable best efforts

subsidiary to take, all actions necessary to satisfy, as promptly as practicable, all conditions, so as to permit the

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, NI is required to submit
a proposal to NI stockholders to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to NI’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Compensation Proposal). Such compensation is
summarized and quantified in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Interests of NI’s
Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.” The Board of Directors encourages you to review carefully the
named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, NI
is asking you to approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of NI approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation that will
or may become payable to NI’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement - Interests of NI’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement
Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve the
Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not
be binding on NI. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the
vote on this Compensation Proposal.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of NI common stock representing a majority of the voting
power present in person, or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to
vote on the Compensation Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation
Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting will have
no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (b) abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal and (c) “broker non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of
the Compensation Proposal. Shares of NI common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and
unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If an NI stockholder returns a

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any
future meetings of NI stockholders. However, if the Merger is not completed, NI stockholders will continue to be
entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
NI stockholders will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2024, which we refer to as the “NI 2024 annual
meeting,” only if the Merger has not already been completed.
As described in our proxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, filed on March 27, 2023, NI
stockholders may submit proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement for the NI 2024 annual meeting and
for consideration at the NI 2024 annual meeting by submitting their proposals in writing to the Secretary of NI in a
timely manner. In order to be considered for inclusion in NI’s proxy materials for the NI 2024 annual meeting,
stockholder proposals must be received by the Secretary of NI no later than November 27, 2023 and must otherwise
comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.
Under our bylaws, a stockholder (or a group of not more than 20 stockholders) that has held at least 3% of NI’s
outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, may nominate and include in our proxy materials for
the NI 2024 annual meeting, director nominees constituting up to the greater of (i) 20% of the number of directors
serving on the Board of Directors of NI as of November 27, 2023 and (ii) two directors, provided that such nominees
do not exceed half of the directors to be elected at an annual meeting and that the requirements set forth in our
bylaws are satisfied. To utilize such “proxy access” nomination process, among other things, the electing
stockholder(s) and proposed nominee(s) must comply with the detailed requirements set forth in our bylaws,
including the provision of the proposing stockholder information, various other required information,
representations, undertakings, agreements and other requirements as set forth in our bylaws and as required by law.
One such requirement is that the nomination(s) must be received in a timely manner between 120 days and 150 days
prior to the first anniversary of the date our proxy statement was first sent to stockholders in connection with the last
annual meeting, which for our proxy materials for the NI 2024 annual meeting would be no earlier than October 28,
2023 and no later than November 27, 2023.
Our bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to business to be brought before an annual
meeting, including stockholder proposals not included in NI’s proxy statement for such annual meeting. Except as
provided in the paragraph above, for director nominations or other business to be properly brought before the NI
2024 annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary of NI at NI’s
principal executive office no later than January 26, 2024 and no earlier than December 27, 2023. If the date of the NI
2024 annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 calendar days from the first anniversary date of the 2023
annual meeting of NI stockholders, a stockholder’s notice of a proposal will be timely if it is received by NI by the
close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to the NI 2024 annual meeting and (ii) the 10th day following the
day NI first publicly announces the date of the NI 2024 annual meeting.
The description of certain provisions of our bylaws above is intended as a summary and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the relevant bylaw provisions regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals
and nominating director candidates. A copy of the full text of the bylaw provisions governing the notice requirements
set forth above may be obtained by writing to NI’s Corporate Secretary at 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin,
Texas 78759 or by calling (512) 683-0100. All notices of proposals and director nominations by NI stockholders
should be sent to National Instruments Corporation, 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas 78759, Attention:

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that National Instruments Corporation (“National Instruments”) proposes to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 12, 2023 (the “Agreement”), among National Instruments, Emerson Electric Co.
(“Emerson”) and Emersub CXIV, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Emerson (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which,
among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into National Instruments (the “Merger”) and each outstanding
share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of National Instruments (“National Instruments Common
Stock”) (other than Subsidiary Shares, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Agreement))
will be converted into the right to receive $60.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of
the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of National
Instruments Common Stock (other than holders of Subsidiary Shares, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares), of
the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.
In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
(1)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to National Instruments;
(2)
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and
prospects of National Instruments furnished to or discussed with us by the management of National
Instruments, including certain financial forecasts relating to National Instruments prepared by the
management of National Instruments (such forecasts, “National Instruments Forecasts”);
(3)
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of National
Instruments with members of senior management of National Instruments;
(4)
reviewed the trading history for National Instruments Common Stock and a comparison of that trading
history with the trading histories of other companies we deemed relevant;
(5)
compared certain financial and stock market information of National Instruments with similar information of
other companies we deemed relevant;
(6)
compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other
transactions we deemed relevant;
(7)
considered the fact that National Instruments publicly announced that it would explore its strategic
alternatives and the results of our efforts on behalf of National Instruments to solicit, at the direction of
National Instruments, indications of interest and definitive proposals from third parties with respect to a
possible acquisition of all or a portion of National Instruments;
(8)
reviewed a draft, dated April 12, 2023, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 
(9)
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we
deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed
by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the management of National Instruments that they
are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any
material respect. With respect to the National Instruments Forecasts, we have been advised by National Instruments,
and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and good faith judgments of the management of National Instruments as to the future financial performance
of National Instruments. We have not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the
assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of National Instruments, nor have we made any physical inspection of
the properties or assets of National Instruments. We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of National
Instruments or Emerson under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.
We have assumed, at the direction of National Instruments, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with
its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the
course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for
the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on National Instruments or the contemplated
benefits of the Merger. We also have assumed, at the direction of National Instruments, that that the final executed
Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by us.
We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other than the
Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the
Merger, any related transactions or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection
with or related to the Merger or otherwise. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Consideration to be received by holders of National Instruments Common Stock (other than holders of Subsidiary
Shares, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any
consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or
otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or
employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise.
Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies
or transactions that might be available to National Instruments or in which National Instruments might engage or as
to the underlying business decision of National Instruments to proceed with or effect the Merger. We are also not
expressing any view or opinion with respect to, and we have relied, at the direction of National Instruments, upon the
assessment of representatives of National Instruments regarding legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters
relating to National Instruments or the Merger, as to which matters we understand that National Instruments obtained
such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, we express no opinion or
recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter.
We have acted as financial advisor to National Instruments in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for
our services, a portion of which is payable upon delivery of this opinion and a significant portion of which is
contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, National Instruments has agreed to reimburse our
expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
We and our affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities
and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth herein, we are
of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of National
Instruments Common Stock (other than holders of Subsidiary Shares, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) is fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:
(i) Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (such shares, collectively, the “Common Stock,” and each, a “Share”) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Subsidiary Shares, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting
Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $60.00 per Share in cash (the “Merger
Consideration”). All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically cancelled upon the conversion thereof and shall cease
to exist, and the holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. Each Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent
(other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Subsidiary Shares”) shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such
Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time.
(ii) Cancellation of Shares. Each Share that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under any of the
Company Equity Plans or the Company ESPP) or held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the “Cancelled Shares”) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
(iii) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
A-6TABLE OF CONTENTS
stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the
common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.
(b) Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by
the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Subsidiary Shares and the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of
such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and
are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of such Shares, as applicable (the “Dissenting Shares”),
pursuant to, and who have properly exercised and perfected their demands for appraisal rights under and
comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Appraisal Rights”) shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being
understood and acknowledged that such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and any such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the
Appraisal Rights); provided, however, that if any such holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting
Shares) shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest thereon or duplication, the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a). “Proposed Dissenting Shares” means shares of Common
Stock whose holders provide demands for appraisal to the Company prior to the Company Stockholders’
Meeting and do not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the
Appraisal Rights. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the Appraisal Rights and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares, of any withdrawals
of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to Appraisal Rights, and (ii) the reasonable opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.
(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
Shares of the Company shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares
by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.

(a) Paying Agent. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and reasonably
approved in advance by the Company in writing (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of holders of
the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares or Subsidiary
Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
Shares (“Certificates”) (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or noncertificated Shares represented by
book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 (such cash being referred to as
the “Payment Fund”). In the event the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.1(a), Parent shall promptly
A-7TABLE OF CONTENTS
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the
shortfall that is required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying
Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this
Agreement.
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
second (2nd) Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually reasonably agree), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares represented by such holder’s properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of a Certificate
may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable under this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), or under any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely
and properly paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.
(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of
the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.2(b) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of
transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article 2.
(d) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall thereafter
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of such Shares who have not
surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of
their Shares. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such

earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(e) No Liability. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(f) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Payment Fund as
reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government; provided, further, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this
Article 2, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to
the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares of the Company. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d).
(g) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.",114,116

for this purpose that performance in respect of all such Company PSUs was achieved at the target performance
level if the applicable performance period has not been completed at or prior to the Effective Time in accordance

whole share. Each Parent RSU shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as

vesting and payment schedule, but excluding any performance-based vesting conditions).

reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) Business Days following

of the recipients of the Company RSU Consideration and the Company PSU Consideration. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 2.3(a) or Section 2.3(c), with respect to any Company RSU or Company PSU
that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that is not
permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code,

obligations of the Lenders to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to
reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating

of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis or that the Financing will not

encourage the making or submission of any proposal, offer or indication of intent that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage in any discussions or

reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Alternative Proposal (except to notify such Person that the
provisions of this Section 5.4(a) prohibit any such discussions or negotiations), (iii) furnish any nonpublic
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with or for the purpose of facilitating or
encouraging an Alternative Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead

understandings, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement
providing for an Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.4(b)); (v)

its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any third party and its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with

of the date hereof) request that each third party that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the 24-
month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Alternative Proposal return or
destroy all confidential information pursuant to such confidentiality agreement heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall confirm to Parent the
receipt of all certifications of such return or destruction from such other Persons as promptly as practicable after

Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal, the
A-32TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company and its Representatives may contact the third party making such Alternative Proposal to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof. If (i) such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) the

Alternative Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, the Company may, so long
as it has otherwise complied with Section 5.4(a) in all material respects, take the following actions to the extent
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law (and the
Company Board determines the same in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel): (A) furnish
nonpublic information to the third party making such Alternative Proposal (including its Representatives and
prospective equity and debt financing sources), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, (i) the
third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company (a copy of which shall be provided for

Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement (1) need not
contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Alternative
Proposal and (2) shall not prohibit the Company from providing any information contemplated by this Section
5.4 to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives) and (ii) the Company promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) provides Parent any such nonpublic information to the extent access to such information was
not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the
third party (including its Representatives) with respect to such Alternative Proposal. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if any inquiries (including any written
request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), proposals or offers with respect to an
Alternative Proposal are received by the Company or any of its Representatives, which notice shall identify the
third party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Alternative Proposal, and, after taking
such action, the Company shall continue to promptly advise Parent on a reasonably current basis of the status
and terms of any material discussions with respect to any such Alternative Proposal and promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials sent
or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any material terms or conditions of any
such Alternative Proposal. It is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or
negotiations permitted under this Section 5.4(b), including any public announcement that the Company or the
Company Board has made any determination contemplated under this Section 5.4(b) to take or engage in any
such actions, shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Change of Recommendation or constitute a basis for Parent
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(ii). Any material amendment to any Alternative Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Alternative Proposal for purposes of the Company’s compliance with this Section
5.4(b).
(c) Except as expressly permitted under this Section 5.4, the Company Board, including any committee
thereof, shall not (i) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
that is mailed by the Company to the stockholders of the Company; (iii) if any Alternative Proposal that is
structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for the outstanding shares of Common Stock is commenced
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act (other than by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent), fail to
recommend, within ten Business Days after such commencement, against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by its stockholders; (iv) approve, adopt, recommend or declare advisable any Alternative
Proposal or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or declare advisable any Alternative Proposal;
(v) following the date any Alternative Proposal or any material modification thereto is first publicly disclosed or
announced, fail to issue a press release reaffirming the Company Recommendation within four Business Days
after a written request by Parent to do so; provided that Parent may only make such request once with respect
to any Alternative Proposal, or (vi) approve, adopt or recommend, or declare advisable or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in and entered into compliance with Section
5.4(b)) with respect to any Alternative Proposal (any such action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through

end of the five-Business Day period following the receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (the “Superior
Proposal Notice Period”), after taking into account any firm commitments made by Parent in writing to amend the
terms of this Agreement during the Superior Proposal Notice Period and in consultation with outside legal
counsel and its independent financial advisor, the Company Board concludes that the Superior Proposal giving

given effect; provided, that any material modifications to the terms of the Superior Proposal shall commence a
new notice period pursuant to clause (A) of three (3) Business Days.

Recommendation”) if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s
outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisor, that the failure of the Company Board to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
that the Company Board shall not be entitled to make such a Permitted Change of Recommendation unless (i)
the Company shall have given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ written notice (an “Intervening Event
Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a Change of Recommendation, which Intervening Event
Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the applicable Intervening Event, and shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to enable Parent to propose
such amendments to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect such a
Change of Recommendation in connection with such Intervening Event, and (ii) unless, at the end of the four-
Business Day period following the delivery of such Intervening Event Notice (the “Intervening Event Notice
Period”), after taking into account any firm commitments made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of this
Agreement during the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such
Change of Recommendation would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law if such amendments were to be given effect; provided, that any material change to the
facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event shall commence a new notice period pursuant to
clause (i) of three (3) Business Days.
(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof from complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law or rules and policies of

position thereunder. No disclosure or communication permitted pursuant to the foregoing sentence or
disclosure that the Company has received an Alternative Proposal and is evaluating such proposal in
accordance with this Section 5.4, shall, in and of itself, be considered a Change of Recommendation or require
the giving of a Superior Proposal Notice, an Intervening Event Notice or compliance with the procedures set
forth in Section 5.4(d) or (e); provided, however, that the Company Board shall not effect a Change of
Recommendation except in accordance with this Section 5.4.

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee, to the extent still employed, (i) base
compensation and target annual cash incentive opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were
provided to the Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) equity incentive opportunities
that are no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, following the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits (excluding any equity or equity based
compensation, employee stock purchase benefits, defined benefit pension benefits, retiree health and welfare
benefits, severance benefits and change in control, transaction and retention bonuses or payments) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to such employee benefits provided to the Continuing Employee by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately

prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, (A) Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Continuing Employee who incurs a qualifying
termination of employment in accordance with Item 34 of Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter during
the one (1)-year period following the Effective Time with severance benefits equal to the greater of (x) the
severance benefits set forth on Section 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (y) the severance benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, following the Effective
Time, under the severance arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (B) during such one (1)-year period
following the Effective Time, severance benefits offered to each Continuing Employee shall be determined
without taking into account any reduction after the Effective Time in such Continuing Employee’s base salary or
wage rate. Notwithstanding anything provided in this Section 5.6(a) or anything else in this this Agreement to
the contrary, each Continuing Employee who, at any time during the Continuation Period, is or becomes covered
by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall solely be provided with compensation, benefits and terms and
conditions of employment that meet the requirements of such Collective Bargaining Agreement.
(b) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits)
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee
after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Old Plans”), provided that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to an Old
Plan, and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Continuing Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the corresponding plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of
the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to recognition of such co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses under any corresponding Company Benefit Plan.
(c) Parent acknowledges that, for purposes of the Company Equity Plans and each Company Benefit Plan
identified with an asterisk (*) in Section 3.16(b) of this Company Disclosure Letter, a “change in control” of the
Company will occur at the Effective Time.
(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.9, (i) the provisions of this Section 5.6 are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, employee or consultant or any other
person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any
purpose and (ii) nothing in this Section 5.6 (A) shall alter or limit the ability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or (B) shall create any obligation on the part of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) to employ or
engage any Service Provider for any period following the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger.

that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company and its

by this Section 5.10(c) because its cost exceeds the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for the years within such six (6)-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.
In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option, or Parent may, at its option
request the Company to, purchase a six-(6) year prepaid “tail” directors’ and officers’, employment practices and

by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.10 (subject
to the undertaking described in Section 5.10(b)).

other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other

consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the

consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, including by (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii)
negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing (the “Definitive Agreements”)
consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions
contained in any related fee letter) and without any Prohibited Modification; provided that Parent will not be
required to enter into the Definitive Agreements unless (x) the closing of the transactions, including the receipt
of proceeds related thereto, contemplated by the Climate Transaction Agreement is not reasonably likely to
occur prior to the Closing and (y) Parent does not have immediate access to alternative financing in an amount,
when taken together with all immediately available funds of Parent on the Closing Date, sufficient to satisfy all
of Parent’s obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any fees and
expenses of or payable by Parent contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions described in,
this Agreement and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness (including the Company
Credit Agreement) of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries contemplated by, or required in connection with the
transactions described in, this Agreement, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the Commitment
Letter and the Definitive Agreements and complying with its obligations thereunder and (iv) enforcing its rights
under the Commitment Letter. Parent shall comply with its obligations, and enforce its rights, under the
Commitment Letter and Definitive Agreements in a timely and diligent manner. Additionally, unless the
Commitment Letter is terminated pursuant to a Permitted Termination, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to consummate and obtain in escrow the proceeds of the Financing (or, in the case of any bridge facilities
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, high yield financing or other financing incurred in lieu thereof) as
promptly as possible after the Syndication Commencement Date (as defined in the Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof) and receipt of the Financing Information; provided that Parent shall have no obligation to fund the
bank debt portion of the Financing into escrow so long as Parent has delivered executed Definitive Agreements
(including, to the extent necessary, any Definitive Agreements for a bridge financing) and the funding thereof is
subject only to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, other than the delivery of definitive
documentation.
(b) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of the
Company: (i) permit, consent to or agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement, termination or
modification to, or any waiver of, any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, waiver or remedy (A) adds new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing, (B)
reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Financing, (C) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified or (D) could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the effects
described in clauses (A) through (D), collectively, the “Prohibited Modifications”); or (ii) terminate or cause the
termination of the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement other than, in each case of this subclause (ii),
the termination thereof resulting from the reduction of 100% of commitments thereunder or loans issued
thereunder, as applicable, in each case pursuant to the mandatory reduction terms of the Commitment Letter as
of the date hereof, including with the proceeds from the

consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Climate Transaction Agreement (which termination shall
not constitute a Prohibited Modification) (a “Permitted Termination”). Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement, termination, modification or waiver (with
any such amendment, replacement, supplement, termination, modification or waiver to, any fee letter to be
redacted in accordance with Section 4.6(c)).
(c) Unless the Commitment Letter is terminated pursuant to a Permitted Termination and until such time,
in the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent
shall (i) promptly notify the Company in writing of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts, and cause each of its Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts, to arrange and
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative financing for any such
unavailable portion from the same or alternative sources (the “Alternative Financing”) in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with the available portion of the Financing, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and to pay the Financing Amounts and, without limiting the foregoing, shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause such Alternative Financing not to include any Prohibited Modifications or conditions to
the consummation thereof that are more onerous than those set forth in the Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, unless the Commitment Letter is terminated
pursuant to a Permitted Termination, in the event that immediately prior to the Closing (A) any portion of the
Financing contemplated to be structured as permanent financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor, (B) all conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than
(x) those conditions that are to be satisfied by action taken at the Closing and (y) those conditions the failure of
which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement) and (C) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 5.16(c)) are available on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to
be used immediately in lieu of such affected portion of the permanent financing. Parent shall provide the
Company with prompt oral and written notice of any actual or threatened breach, default, cancellation,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement and a copy of
any written notice or other written communication from any Lender or other financing source with respect to any
actual or threatened breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment
Letter or any Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing, including any Alternative
Financing.
(d) The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Parent with this Section 5.16(d) shall not relieve Parent
of its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing
or any Alternative Financing is available. To the extent Parent obtains Alternative Financing or amends,
replaces, supplements, modifies or waives any of the Financing, in each case pursuant to this Section 5.16 and
without any Prohibited Modification, references to the “Financing,” “Financing Parties,” “Commitment Letter”
and “Definitive Agreements” (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed to refer to such
Alternative Financing, the commitments thereunder and the agreements with respect thereto, or the Financing as
so amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived.

financing (including the Financing) by Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing or other transactions
be a condition to any of Parent’s obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company’s breach of any of the covenants required to be performed by it under this
Section 5.17 shall not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b),

Section 7.3(b)) would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b), as applicable, the failing party shall pay to the other
party all fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including attorneys’ fees as well as expenses incurred in
connection with any action initiated by such party), together with interest on the amount of the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal,
in effect on the date such payment is required to be made. The parties further acknowledge that neither the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but is each liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate each party in the circumstances in which either the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and
on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision.
(d) Except as set forth in Section 7.3(c) and Section 8.14, and except for all expenses incurred by any party
in connection with the printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC filing fees)

and when required by Section 7.3(a), none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives shall have
any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives. Payment of the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 7.3(a) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, employees, partners, stockholders,
optionholders, managers, members, other Representatives or Affiliates (collectively, “Parent Related Parties”) or
any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or
any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any matters forming the basis for such termination. Except as set forth in Section 7.3(c), in
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a), Parent’s right to
receive payment from the Company of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, employees, partners, stockholders, optionholders,
managers, members, other Representatives or Affiliates (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for
a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, none
of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 7.3(d) shall limit any remedies of Parent prior to such termination, including specific enforcement
pursuant to Section 8.5.
(e) Except as set forth in Section 7.3(c), and Section 8.14, and except for all filing fees paid by any party in
respect of any HSR Act or other filing under any Antitrust Law or Foreign Investment Law (which shall be
borne by Parent), upon the payment by Parent of the Parent Termination Fee as and when required by Section
7.3(b), none of Parent, its Subsidiaries or their respective former, current or future officers,

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it
whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (b) an injunction restraining such
breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger
and the Merger has not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that the
Company and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to
compensate the Company and its stockholders, and that the Company on behalf of itself and its stockholders shall be

party seeks specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this Section 8.5, the parties shall use their best
efforts to seek and obtain an expedited schedule for such proceedings and shall not oppose any party’s request for
