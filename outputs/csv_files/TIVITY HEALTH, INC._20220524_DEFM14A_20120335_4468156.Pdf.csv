Date, Time and Place
The special meeting of Tivity Health stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) will be held at Tivity Health’s corporate
headquarters, located at 701 Cool Springs Blvd., Franklin, Tennessee, 37067, on June 23, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Central
Time, unless the meeting is adjourned or postponed.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Tivity Health (“Tivity Health Common Stock”), at the close of business on May 23, 2022, the record date for the
Special Meeting (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of Tivity Health
Common Stock you owned at the close of business on the Record Date.
Purpose
At the Special Meeting, we will ask Tivity Health stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on proposals
(i) to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may
become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and (iii) to approve
one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement
or to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained (collectively, the “Special Meeting Proposals”).
Quorum
The holders of a majority of voting power of all issued and outstanding Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote
at the Special Meeting, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the
Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 49,932,432 shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. 24,966,217 shares must be present or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting to have a quorum.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is
required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special
Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve (i) by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the
proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers
in connection with the Merger and (ii) the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is
not initially obtained. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of
shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity
Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to approve the adjournment
from time to time of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate. Because all three proposals presented to
stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.
Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as
votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.
Share Ownership of Tivity Health’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of May 23, 2022, the Record Date, Tivity Health’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,325,979 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, representing approximately 2.66%
of the outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock. Tivity Health’s directors and executive officers have
informed Tivity Health that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock “FOR”
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation that will
or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and “FOR”
the proposal to approve the adjournment from time to time of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate.
How You Can Vote
You may cast your shares in any of four ways: (i) by voting over the internet using the website indicated on the
enclosed proxy card; (ii) by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card; (iii) by signing, dating
and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; and (iv) by attending the Special
Meeting and voting by ballot.
Please note that participants in our 401(k) Plan must provide voting instructions to Fidelity Management Trust

Plan voted?” in the Questions and Answers section of the Proxy Statement for more information.
If your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in a street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-routine matters,” your
broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting
Proposals. If your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee
has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage you to authorize your broker, bank
or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” each of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the instructions
provided on the voting instruction form.
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders to vote electronically. Please submit your

access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may alternatively vote by signing, dating and returning the
enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting. If you
properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders will vote your shares as you
have directed.
All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted via the internet,
by telephone and by mail) received before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or
superseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no

Tivity Health retained Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (“Lazard”) to act as a financial advisor to Tivity Health in connection
with the Merger. In connection with this engagement, the Board requested that Lazard evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to holders of Tivity Health Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) of the Transaction
Consideration to be paid to such holders in the Merger.
4TABLE OF CONTENTS
On April 5, 2022, Lazard rendered an oral opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its
written opinion, dated April 5, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations set forth in Lazard’s
written opinion, the Transaction Consideration to be paid to holders of Tivity Health Common Stock (other than
Excluded Holders) in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated April 5, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is

Lazard’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or business
strategy in which Tivity Health might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by Tivity Health to engage in
the transaction. Lazard’s opinion was not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder
as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any matter relating thereto.

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Tivity Health’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of and
considered these interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and
negotiating the Merger Agreement, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that
the Merger Agreement be adopted by Tivity Health stockholders. These interests include the following:
•
the accelerated vesting of (i) unvested options to purchase shares of Tivity Health Common Stock
(“Company Options”), (ii) Tivity Health restricted stock units (the “Company RSUs”) granted prior to April
5, 2022, and (iii) Tivity Health market stock units (the “Company MSUs”) into the Transaction
Consideration;
•
the accelerated vesting of a prorated portion of unvested Company RSUs granted after April 5, 2022, with
limited exceptions for certain Company RSUs which will vest in full, into the Transaction Consideration;
•
the eligibility of each named executive officer to receive enhanced severance payments and benefits under
applicable agreements if such officer’s employment is terminated in connection with a qualifying
termination of employment within 12 months following the consummation of the Merger;
•
the possibility of Tivity Health’s executive officers entering into compensatory arrangements with Parent or
its affiliates prior to or following the closing of the Merger; and
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving
Corporation.
See the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger”
beginning on page 56 of this Proxy Statement for a more detailed description of these interests. If the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by Tivity Health stockholders, the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock
held by Tivity Health’s directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock held by all other Tivity Health stockholders entitled to receive the Transaction
Consideration.

The Merger Agreement provides that Tivity Health’s equity awards and long-term incentive plan awards that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the following treatment as of the Effective Time:
Company Options
If the Merger is completed, each Company Option, whether or not vested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be cancelled and will entitle the holder, on or before the later of (i) five business days
following the Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, to receive
an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company Option as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Transaction Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If the exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of a Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Transaction Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger without
any action on the part of and without any payment to the Company Option holder.
Company MSUs
If the Merger is completed, each Company MSU award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically become vested, will be cancelled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof,
and will entitle the holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and
(ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest and
subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Tivity Health Common Stock that would have vested pursuant to the terms of such Company MSU award
based on actual performance through the Effective Time, and (B) the Transaction Consideration.
Company RSUs
If the Merger is completed, except as described below for Company RSU awards granted after April 5, 2022, each
Company RSU award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically become fully vested,
will be cancelled and will entitle the holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the
Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Transaction Consideration.
Company RSUs Granted After April 5, 2022
If the Merger is completed, except for (i) deferred Company RSUs granted to certain non-employee directors under
Tivity Health’s Director Deferred Compensation Program and (ii) limited exceptions for certain Company RSUs, which,
in each case, will vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU award granted after April 5,
2022 will vest immediately prior to the Effective Time on a prorated basis, with such proration based on a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days of continuous service provided by the grantee to Tivity Health between
the grant date of the Company RSU award and the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is 1,096, and
otherwise be treated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as described above. The portion of any
such equity award granted after April 5, 2022 that does not vest in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence will be forfeited without consideration upon the Effective Time without any action on the part of the holder
of such Company RSU award.

The total amount of funds necessary to consummate the Merger and related transactions, including payment of

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The
Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 63 of this Proxy Statement) in
exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of Tivity Health Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss by such
U.S. Holder in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between the cash such U.S. Holder receives in the
Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock surrendered in the
Merger.
If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
of the Merger” beginning on page 63 of this Proxy Statement), the Merger generally will not result in U.S. federal
income tax to you unless you have certain connections with the United States, but you may be subject to U.S.
backup withholding tax unless you comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish a valid
exemption from U.S. backup withholding taxes.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section entitled
“The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 63 of this Proxy Statement.

terms thereof; granting rescissory damages; directing the defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a
result of the defendants’ alleged wrongdoing; and awarding the plaintiffs’ costs and disbursements, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses.
Tivity Health believes that the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit and Tivity Health and the
individual defendants intend to defend against the Complaints; however, Tivity Health cannot predict the amount of
time and expense that will be required to resolve either or both of the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.
Additional lawsuits may be filed against Tivity Health or its directors and officers in connection with the Merger. The
outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay
consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Tivity Health, including any costs associated with the
indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no order,
judgment, or injunction, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, by any court or other tribunal of competent
jurisdiction has been entered and continues to be in effect, and no law has been adopted or is effective, in each case
that restrains, enjoins, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff
were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms,
then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected time frame, or at all.

acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or similar contract, whether written, oral, binding or

Under the Merger Agreement, prior to, but not after, obtaining the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding

to, with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, either or both: (1) make a Company Adverse Recommendation

likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. However, prior to taking such
action, Tivity Health must have (i) given

neither the Board nor any committee thereof may make a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change” (as defined

this Proxy Statement).
Under the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances and subject to certain requirements described in the
section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Adverse Recommendation Changes” beginning on page 78 of this

Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an “Intervening Event” (as defined in the section
entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Adverse Recommendation Changes” beginning on page 78 of this Proxy
Statement), if prior to taking such action, the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. However, before taking such action: (i) Tivity Health must have given
Parent at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, specifying in reasonable
detail the Intervening Event and the potential reasons that the Board is proposing to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; (ii) if requested in writing by Parent, Tivity Health must have negotiated in good faith with
Parent during such four business day period to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger
Agreement such that it would cause the Board to not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and
(iii) following the end of such four business days period, the Board must have considered in good faith any revisions
to the terms of the Merger Agreement to which Parent has committed in writing, and must have determined, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, assuming the revisions committed to by Parent in
writing were to be given effect, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to certain requirements
described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Adverse Recommendation Changes” beginning on

Parent, Merger Sub and Tivity Health are entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other

Notwithstanding the foregoing, under the Merger Agreement, the right of Tivity Health to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedies enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to effect the closing of the Merger will only be available if: (i) the conditions to the

If the Merger is consummated, shares of Tivity Health Common Stock held by Tivity Health stockholders who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold their shares of Tivity Health Common
Stock through the Effective Time of the Merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares (and who do not
withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights), and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of
the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive Transaction Consideration, but the holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL. This means that such Tivity Health stockholders will be entitled to have their shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”) and to receive
payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest based to be paid upon the
amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery. Tivity Health stockholders who
wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to
the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they would
receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must, among other things, submit a written demand for appraisal in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL to Tivity Health before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, you
must not vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and you must
continue to hold the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock of record through the Effective Time. Your failure to
follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this Proxy Statement in the section
entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 95 of this Proxy Statement, and Section 262 of the DGCL regarding
appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares of Tivity
Health Common Stock through the Fidelity 401(k) Plan or a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures
for the making of a demand for appraisal by such broker, bank or other nominee.

Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions
that may be important to you as a Tivity Health stockholder. You are encouraged to read carefully the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement and the documents we
refer to in this Proxy Statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement
without charge by following the instructions in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 101 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On April 5, 2022, Tivity Health entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub with
and into Tivity Health, with Tivity Health surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, an
affiliate of Stone Point Capital. The Board is furnishing this Proxy Statement and form of proxy card to the
holders of Tivity Health Common Stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the other proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof. This Proxy Statement includes information that we are required to
provide to you under the SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting on the matters presented at the
Special Meeting. Tivity Health stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 23, 2022 may attend
the Special Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the Special Meeting Proposals.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will be held at Tivity Health’s headquarters located at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin,
Tennessee, 37067, on June 23, 2022 at 9:00 a.m., Central Time.
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Tivity Health?
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Tivity Health by Parent through the merger of Merger Sub with and
into Tivity Health pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is
approved by the requisite number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, and the other closing conditions
under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Tivity Health,
with Tivity Health continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Tivity Health will become
a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Tivity Health Common Stock.
Tivity Health expects to delist its common stock from Nasdaq and de-register its common stock under the
Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Tivity Health would no longer be a
publicly traded company, and Tivity Health will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Tivity
Health Common Stock.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
Upon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 in
cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Tivity Health Common Stock
that you own, unless you have properly exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the
DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, you will
be entitled to receive $3,250.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, in exchange
for your 100 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock. In either case, your shares will be canceled and you will not
own nor be entitled to acquire shares in the Surviving Corporation or Parent.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 23, 2022 are entitled to notice of the Special
Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other
15TABLE OF CONTENTS
nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-routine
matters,” your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the
Special Meeting Proposals. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name are described under the
question “How may I vote?” below.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
For Tivity Health stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the Special Meeting and are a stockholder
of record, you may cast your shares in any of four ways:
•
by voting over the internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in person and voting by ballot.
For holders in street name: If your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in street name and you do not
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting
Proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority
to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in
street name, your broker, bank or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy
Statement. We encourage you to authorize your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both
of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form.
If you submit your proxy by internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your
shares of Tivity Health Common Stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting and vote by ballot, you are encouraged to vote your shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid legal proxy to
vote shares which you beneficially own and wish to change your vote, you may still vote your shares of Tivity
Health Common Stock by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy.
Q:
How many votes do I have?
A:
Each holder of Tivity Health Common Stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before
the Special Meeting for each share of Tivity Health Common Stock that such holder owned as of the Record
Date.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A:
Only stockholders of record or beneficial owners of Tivity Health Common Stock as of the close of business on
the Record Date or their duly appointed proxies are entitled to attend the Special Meeting. If you plan to attend
the Special Meeting, please note that you will need to provide proof of ownership of Tivity Health Common
Stock and provide a government-issued picture identification card, such as your driver’s license. If you hold
shares through an account with a broker, bank or other nominee, please bring to the Special Meeting your
statement evidencing your beneficial ownership of Tivity Health Common Stock as of the Record Date and
provide a government-issued picture identification card, such as your driver’s license. Please note that if you
hold shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and plan to attend the Special Meeting in person and
would like to vote there, you will need to contact your broker, bank or other nominee and request a “legal proxy.”
If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee and you would rather have an admission ticket,
you can obtain one in advance by mailing a written request, along with proof of your ownership of Company
common stock, to:
Tivity Health, Inc. 
701 Cool Springs Boulevard
Franklin, Tennessee 37067
Attention: Secretary

TABLE OF CONTENTS
All stockholders and beneficial owners should bring a government-issued picture identification card, such as
your driver’s license, as you will also be asked to provide a government-issued identification card at the
registration desk on the day of the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Special
Meeting. Everyone who attends the Special Meeting must abide by the rules for the conduct of the Special
Meeting. These rules will be printed on the Special Meeting agenda. No cameras, recording equipment, other
electronic devices, large bags or packages will be permitted in the Special Meeting.
In any case, we recommend that you submit your proxy via the internet or by telephone by following the
instructions on the enclosed proxy card, or by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the
postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person. If you properly and
timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders will vote your shares as you have
directed. If you attend the Special Meeting in person and vote by ballot, your vote by ballot will revoke any
proxy previously submitted. If you hold your shares in street name, because you are not the stockholder of
record, you may not vote your shares by ballot at the Special Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid
legal proxy from your bank, broker, bank or other nominee.
Please note that participants in our 401(k) Plan may not vote their plan shares by ballot at the Special Meeting
and in order to vote their shares, must provide voting instructions to Fidelity by June 20, 2022 at 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time. See “How are my shares in Tivity Health’s 401(k) Plan voted?” in this section of the Proxy
Statement for more information.
Q:
How are my shares in Tivity Health’s 401(k) Plan voted?
A:
For those stockholders who hold shares pursuant to the 401(k) Plan, Fidelity acts as trustee for shares held in
the 401(k) Plan. The governing documents of the 401(k) Plan require Fidelity, as trustee, to vote the shares as
directed by the plan participants for whose benefit the shares are held. Fidelity will use an independent third
party to tabulate the voting directions of all participants who provide such directions to Fidelity. Neither the
tabulator nor Fidelity will provide the individual participant voting directions to Tivity Health, unless otherwise
required by law. Shares of Tivity Health Common Stock for which no direction is received by Fidelity from the
participants by June 20, 2022 at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, will not be voted.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger; and
•
to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to
approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained.
Q:
How does the Transaction Consideration compare to the market price of Tivity Health Common Stock prior to
the announcement of the Merger?
A:
The Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share represents a premium of:
•
approximately 28% over the closing stock price on December 7, 2021, the last trading day prior to the $33.00
per share unsolicited proposal from Stone Point Capital;
•
approximately 31% over the closing stock price on January 7, 2022, the last trading day prior to the
commencement of outreach to potential buyers;
•
approximately 19% over the closing stock price on February 28, 2022, the last trading day prior to the
commencement of Stone Point Capital’s outreach to potential debt financing sources;
•
approximately 18% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock
during the 90-day period ended April 4, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Tivity Health encourages you to read the accompanying Proxy Statement, including all documents incorporated
by reference into the accompanying Proxy Statement, and its annexes carefully and in their entirety. Then as
promptly as possible, follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card to submit your proxy electronically
over the internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. We encourage all
stockholders to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a touch-tone phone or the
Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. If your
shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee has enclosed
a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. Please do not send your stock certificate(s) with your proxy
card. See “How may I vote?” in this section of the Proxy Statement for more information.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
On April 5, 2022, the Board, after considering various factors, including those described in the section entitled
“The Merger-Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 41 of this Proxy
Statement, unanimously (i) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, Tivity Health and its
stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of Tivity Health and its stockholders to enter into, and
approved, adopted and declared advisable, the Merger Agreement, (iii) approved the execution and delivery by
Tivity Health of the Merger Agreement, the performance by Tivity Health of its covenants and agreements
contained therein and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained
therein, (iv) directed that the approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to the
stockholders of Tivity Health, and (v) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Tivity Health vote in
favor of the approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the
adoption of the Merger Agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote (i) “FOR” the proposal to approve the adoption of the
Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger; (ii)
“FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity
Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and (iii) “FOR” the proposal to approve
one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger
Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now?
A:
No. If you are a record holder, after the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you
will receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificate(s) to the Paying Agent (as
defined in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures” beginning
on page 69 of this Proxy Statement) in order to receive the cash payment of the Transaction Consideration for
each share of Tivity Health Common Stock represented by such stock certificate(s). You should use the letter of
transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the Transaction Consideration to which you are entitled upon
the consummation of the Merger. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please contact your broker, bank,
Fidelity 401(k) Plan trustee or other nominee for instructions as to how to effect the surrender of your shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock in exchange for the Transaction Consideration in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement. Please do not send in your stock certificates now.
Q:
If I do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the Transaction Consideration for my shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the closing of the Merger will
include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate(s). This will include an
affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to
post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Tivity Health stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for
any other reason, Tivity Health stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock. Instead, Tivity Health will remain an independent public company, Tivity Health Common Stock
will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to
file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Tivity Health Common Stock.
Under certain specified circumstances in which the Merger is not consummated, Tivity Health may be required
to pay Parent a termination fee, or under certain other specified circumstances, Tivity Health may be entitled to
receive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the
sections entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees” beginning on page 88 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
Do any of Tivity Health’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ
from those of Tivity Health stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Tivity Health’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Tivity Health stockholders generally. The Board was
aware of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Tivity Health stockholders. For a
description of the interests of Tivity Health’s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger” beginning
on page 56 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for Tivity Health’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
Under SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger, commonly referred to as “golden parachute” compensation.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote
thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at
the Special Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve: (i) by means of a non-binding,
advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and (ii) the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. This means that the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater
than 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. The failure of any stockholder of record to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by
telephone, submit a signed proxy card, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger or the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from
time to time, if necessary or appropriate. Abstentions will be counted as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity
Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. Because all of the proposals
presented to stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the
Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and
will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of May 23, 2022, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there were
approximately 49,932,432 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock issued and outstanding. Each holder of Tivity
Health Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Tivity Health Common Stock owned by such holder as
of the Record Date.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, Inc., you are
considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this Proxy Statement
and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Tivity Health. As the stockholder of record you have the
right to vote by proxy, which involves granting your voting rights directly to Tivity Health or to a third party, or
to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, or if your shares are held through the Fidelity
401(k) Plan, you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been
forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be
the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other
nominee how to vote your shares. Without your voting instructions, because of the non-routine nature of the
Special Meeting Proposals, your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the
Special Meeting Proposals.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Tivity
Health Common Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the
Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated Richard Ashworth, Adam
Holland and Raymond Bilbao, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special
Meeting.
Q:
Can I change or revoke my proxy?
A:
You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you
attend the Special Meeting, by voting by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Tivity Health’s Secretary, at Tivity Health’s mailing address on
the first page of this Proxy Statement before the Special Meeting, which states that you have revoked your
proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in person and voting by ballot. Attending the Special Meeting will not in
and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote by ballot at the Special
Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.
Please note that participants in our 401(k) Plan may not vote their plan shares by ballot at the Special Meeting
and in order to vote their shares, must provide voting instructions to Fidelity by June 20, 2022 at 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time. See “How are my shares in Tivity Health’s 401(k) Plan voted?” in this section of the Proxy
Statement for more information.
Your latest dated proxy card, internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may change your voting
instructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
If a Tivity Health stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or
may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and “FOR”
the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special
Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained, in the event such
proposal is called to a vote.
Shares of the Tivity Health Common Stock held in the Fidelity 401(k) Plan are voted by the Fidelity 401(k) Plan’s
trustee in accordance with specific instructions given by the Fidelity 401(k) Plan participants to whose accounts
such shares of the Tivity Health Common Stock have been allocated. Any shares of Tivity Health Common
Stock held in a Fidelity 401(k) Plan for which no instructions are received will not be voted.
Q:
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
A:
The holders of a majority in voting power of all issued and outstanding Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of
business at the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 49,932,432 shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. If you submit a properly executed
proxy by internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In addition, abstentions will be
counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of
establishing a quorum. As a result, at least 24,966,217 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a
quorum. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, will have power to adjourn the Special Meeting from time to time, without notice
other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented.
Q:
How can I obtain a proxy card?
A:
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.
For Tivity Health stockholders of record: Please call Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 750-0854 (toll-free from
the U.S. and Canada) or +1(412) 232-3651 (from other locations).
For holders in “street name”: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar
institution.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Tivity Health Common Stock after the close of
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be
consummated. If you sell or transfer your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock after the close of business on
the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the provision of a proxy)
are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you
notifies Tivity Health in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the
Transaction Consideration, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your
shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares at the Special Meeting.
Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock after the close of business on
the Record Date, you are encouraged to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote via the
internet or telephone.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and
multiple proxy cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote via the internet or telephone (or complete, date, sign and return) with respect to each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Tivity Health Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the
Effective Time?
A:
If you transfer your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the Effective
Time, you will have transferred the right to receive Transaction Consideration to the person to whom you
transfer your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock. In order to receive the Transaction Consideration, you
must hold your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock through the Effective Time.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
Tivity Health has retained a representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions to serve as inspector of election in
connection with the Special Meeting. The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate
votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a
quorum is present.
Q:
Who will solicit votes for and bear the cost and expenses of this proxy solicitation?
A:
The cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by Tivity Health. Our directors, officers and employees may
solicit proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. We will pay these
directors, officers and employees no additional compensation for these services. We will reimburse banks,
brokers and other nominees for their reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding this Proxy
Statement and related materials to, and obtaining instructions relating to such materials from, beneficial owners
of Tivity Health Common Stock. Tivity Health has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) as its
proxy solicitor. Innisfree will solicit proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other
electronic means. Under our agreement with Innisfree, Innisfree will receive an estimated fee not to exceed
$25,000 plus reimbursement of its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses for its services. In addition, Innisfree and
certain related persons will be indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the
engagement.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
Tivity Health intends to notify stockholders of the results of the Special Meeting by issuing a press release,
which it will also file with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Tivity Health Common Stock for cash
pursuant to the Merger?
A:
The exchange of Tivity Health Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 63 of this Proxy Statement) who
exchanges shares of Tivity Health Common Stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 63 of this Proxy
Statement), the Merger generally will not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have certain
connections with the United States but you may be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax unless you comply
with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish a valid exemption from U.S. backup withholding
taxes.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 63 of this Proxy
Statement.

If the Merger is completed, each Company Option, whether or not vested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and will entitle the holder, on or before the later of (i) five business
days following the Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time,
to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Transaction
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company Option
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of a
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Transaction Consideration, such Company Option shall be
cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on the part of and without any payment to the Company
Option holder.
If the Merger is completed, each Company MSU award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will automatically become vested, will be cancelled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary
thereof, and will entitle the holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the
Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock that would have vested pursuant to the
terms of such Company MSU award based on actual performance through the Effective Time, and (B) the
Transaction Consideration.
If the Merger is completed, except as described below for Company RSU awards granted after April 5, 2022, each
Company RSU award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically become fully
vested, will be cancelled and will entitle the holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days
following the Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an
amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock then underlying such
Company RSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Transaction Consideration.
If the Merger is completed, except for (i) deferred Company RSUs granted to certain non-employee directors
under Tivity Health’s Director Deferred Compensation Program and (ii) limited exceptions for certain Company
RSUs, which, in each case, will vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU award
granted after April 5, 2022 will vest immediately prior to the Effective Time on a prorated basis, with such
proration based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of continuous service provided by
the grantee to Tivity Health between the grant date of the Company RSU award and the Effective Time, and the
denominator of which is 1,096, and otherwise be treated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement,
as described above. The portion of any such equity award granted after April 5, 2022 that does not vest in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence will be forfeited without consideration upon the Effective
Time without any action on the part of the holder of such Company RSU award.
For additional information regarding the treatment of Tivity Health’s outstanding equity awards, see the section
entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Transaction Consideration-Outstanding Tivity Health Equity
Awards” beginning on page 68 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be consummated?
A:
Tivity Health and Parent are working toward consummating the Merger as quickly as possible. Assuming the
timely receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement) of other closing conditions, including approval by Tivity Health’s stockholders of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in or before the third
quarter of 2022.

Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. See the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 25 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, shares of Tivity Health Common Stock held by stockholders who do not vote in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold their shares of Tivity Health Common
Stock through the Effective Time of the Merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares (and who do
not withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights), and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section
262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive Transaction Consideration, but the holders of
such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such Tivity Health stockholders are entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Tivity
Health Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by
the Court of Chancery. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in the section entitled
“Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 95 of this Proxy Statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this Proxy Statement.

This Proxy Statement, and the documents to which Tivity Health refers you in this Proxy Statement, as well as
information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by Tivity Health or on Tivity
Health’s behalf, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including but

materially from those set forth in these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not
limited to: (i) the risk that the proposed Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may
adversely affect Tivity Health’s business and the price of the Tivity Health Common Stock; (ii) the failure to satisfy
any of the conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, including the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by Tivity Health’s stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals; (iii) the occurrence of any
event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement,
including in circumstances requiring Tivity Health to pay a termination fee; (iv) the effect of the announcement or
pendency of the proposed transaction on Tivity Health’s business relationships, operating results and business
generally; (v) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts Tivity Health’s current plans and operations; (vi) Tivity
Health’s ability to retain and hire key personnel in light of the proposed transaction; (vii) risks related to diverting

financing arrangements set forth in the commitment letters received in connection with the Merger; (x) potential
litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against Stone Point Capital, Tivity Health or their respective
directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto; (xi) continued availability of
capital and financing; (xii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact Tivity Health’s
ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; (xiii) unpredictability and severity of
catastrophic events, including but not limited to acts of terrorism, war or hostilities or the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2
or COVID-19 and any variants, evolutions or mutations thereof (“COVID-19”), as well as management’s response to

This Proxy Statement is being furnished to Tivity Health stockholders as a part of the solicitation of proxies by the
Board for use at the Special Meeting to be held at Tivity Health’s corporate headquarters, located at 701 Cool Springs

At the Special Meeting, Tivity Health stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on proposals to:
•
adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger; and
•
approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,

Only Tivity Health stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 23, 2022 are entitled to notice of the
Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. A list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection in Tivity Health’s headquarters
located at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, during regular business hours for a period of at
least ten days before the Special Meeting and at the location of the Special Meeting during the Special Meeting.
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present. The holders of a
majority of Tivity Health Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting for the transaction of business. Abstentions
will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
With respect to shares held in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee generally has the discretionary
authority to vote uninstructed shares on “routine” matters, but cannot vote such uninstructed shares on “non-
routine” matters. A “broker non-vote” will occur if your broker, bank or other nominee cannot vote your shares on a
particular matter because it has not received instructions from you and does not have discretionary voting authority
on that matter or because your broker, bank or other nominee chooses not to vote on a matter for which it does have
discretionary voting authority.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon
is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of Tivity
Health Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present, or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting,
provided a quorum is present, is required to approve: (i) by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger, and (ii) the proposal approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if
necessary or appropriate. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is
greater than 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. The failure of any stockholder of record to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by
telephone, submit a signed proxy card, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the proposal to approve

one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. Abstentions will be
counted as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable
by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to approve one or
more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. Because each of the
proposals presented to stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at
the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and
will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.

At the close of business on the Record Date, Tivity Health’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,325,979 shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, which represented
approximately 2.66% of the shares of outstanding Tivity Health Common Stock on that date. The directors and
executive officers have informed Tivity Health that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal regarding

card and follow the instructions. You will need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to

have access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you can vote:
•
Via Mail - If you choose to vote via mail, mark your proxy card, date and sign it, and return it in the postage-
paid envelope provided. Proxy cards that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at
the Special Meeting and cannot be voted. If you are a stockholder of record and you return your signed
proxy card but do not indicate your voting preferences, the persons named in the proxy card will vote the
shares represented by that proxy as recommended by the Board.
•
At the Special Meeting - Stockholders of record may vote in person by following the procedures described
above to attend the Special Meeting. You may also be represented by another person at the Special
Meeting by executing a proper proxy card designating that person. Any previously submitted proxies will
be superseded by the vote cast at the Special Meeting.
Voting instructions are included on your enclosed proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed proxies
received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of
the stockholders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” adoption of
the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or
may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and “FOR” the
proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at

the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained.
No proxy that is specifically marked against adoption of the Merger Agreement will be voted in favor of the proposed
compensation arrangements for Tivity Health’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, unless it is
specifically marked “FOR” the approval of such proposal.
For Beneficial Owners
If your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in a street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because all of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-routine
matters,” your broker, bank or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the
Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank
or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage you to authorize
your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” each of the Special Meeting Proposals by following
the instructions provided on the voting instruction form. If you do not vote via the internet or telephone through
your broker, bank or other nominee or do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, or do not
attend the Special Meeting and vote with a proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, it will be counted as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not have any effect on the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger or the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special

Stockholders of record retain the power to revoke their proxy or change their vote at any time before it is voted at the
Special Meeting, even if they sign the proxy card or voting instruction card in the form accompanying this Proxy
Statement, via telephone or via the Internet. Stockholders of record can revoke their proxy or change their vote at any
time before it is exercised by giving written notice specifying such revocation, to the attention of our Secretary at
Tivity Health, Inc., 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, so that it is received prior to 11:59 p.m.,
Central Time, on the night before the Special Meeting. Stockholders of record may also change their vote by timely
delivery of a valid, later-dated proxy signed and returned by mail prior to 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the night before
the Special Meeting or by voting by ballot in person at the Special Meeting. Simply attending the Special Meeting
will not constitute revocation of your proxy.
If your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you should
follow the instructions of such broker, bank or other nominee regarding the revocation of proxies. If you have voted
via the Internet or via telephone, you may change your vote by signing on to the website and following the prompts
or calling the toll-free number again and following the instructions.
Any adjournment, recess or postponement of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will
allow Tivity Health stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at

In addition to the proposal to approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the proposal to approve, by non-
binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger, Tivity Health stockholders are also being asked to approve a proposal that
will give the Board authority to adjourn the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate in the view
of the Board, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to
approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained. In addition, the Board may
postpone the Special Meeting before it commences in accordance with Tivity Health’s bylaws.
If a quorum is not present or if there are not sufficient votes for the approval of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, Tivity Health expects that the Special Meeting will be adjourned, in order to solicit additional proxies in
accordance with the Merger Agreement. At any subsequent reconvening of the Special Meeting, all proxies will be
voted in the same manner as the manner in which such proxies would have been voted at the original convening of
the Special Meeting, except for any proxies that have been validly revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent
meeting.

If the Special Meeting is adjourned, we are not required to give notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting
if announced at the Special Meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless the adjournment is for more than 30

the Merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the
Court of Chancery. Tivity Health stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged
to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they would
receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must, among other things, submit a written demand for appraisal in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL to Tivity Health before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, you
must not vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and you must
continue to hold the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock of record through the Effective Time. Your failure to
follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this Proxy Statement in the section
entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 95 of this Proxy Statement, and Section 262 of the DGCL regarding
appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares of Tivity
Health Common Stock through the Fidelity 401(k) Plan, or a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures
for the making of a demand for appraisal by such broker, bank or other nominee.

purpose and activities incident to its formation. Upon the consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to
exist.
31TABLE OF CONTENTS
Parent and Merger Sub are each affiliated with the Stone Point Funds. Parent, Merger Sub and the Stone Point Funds
are each associated with Stone Point Capital, a leading private equity firm, investing in businesses within the global
financial services industry and related sectors. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be indirectly
owned by the Stone Point Funds and certain of their affiliates.
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (1) the Stone Point Funds have
provided Parent with the Equity Financing in an amount of $1,010,000,000 and (2) Parent has obtained the Debt
Financing in an aggregate amount of $1,200,000,000 from Apollo, HPS, SPC, BSP and Owl Rock. Such amounts will be

Effect of the Merger
If the Merger Agreement is adopted by Tivity Health stockholders and certain other conditions to the consummation
of the Merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Tivity Health, with Tivity Health
surviving the Merger as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Tivity Health, Inc. will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and Tivity Health Common Stock will no longer be publicly traded. In addition,
Tivity Health Common Stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, in each case, in
accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and Tivity Health will no longer file periodic reports with the
SEC on account of Tivity Health Common Stock. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or at such later time as Tivity Health and Parent may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).
Effect on Tivity Health if the Merger Is Not Consummated
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Tivity Health stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any
other reason, Tivity Health stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock.
Instead, Tivity Health will remain an independent public company, Tivity Health Common Stock will continue to be
listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and Tivity Health will continue to file periodic
reports with the SEC on account of Tivity Health Common Stock. In addition, if the Merger is not consummated,
Tivity Health expects that Tivity Health’s management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it
is being operated today.
Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the
Merger not to be consummated, it is possible that the price of Tivity Health Common Stock will decline significantly.
If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Tivity Health Common Stock would return to the price at
which it trades as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares of Tivity Health Common Stock. If the Merger is not consummated,
the Board will continue to evaluate and review Tivity Health’s business operations, properties, capitalization and
strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Tivity Health
stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other
transaction acceptable to Tivity Health will be offered or that Tivity Health’s business, prospects or results of
operation will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, under specified circumstances, Tivity Health may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, or may be
entitled to receive a reverse termination fee from Parent, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described
in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees” beginning on page 88 of this Proxy
Statement.

As part of its ongoing oversight and evaluation of Tivity Health’s business, the Board, together with senior
management, regularly reviews and assesses opportunities to increase stockholder value, including evaluating
various potential strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and internal restructurings. In recent
years, Tivity Health has undergone significant leadership changes among the Board, beginning with the addition of
Anthony Sanfilippo and Erin Russell as new independent directors in March 2020 and the subsequent appointment
of Mr. Sanfilippo as independent Chairman in April 2020. These changes at the Board level were accompanied by
changes among the senior management team, including the hiring of Richard Ashworth as President and Chief
Executive Officer in June 2020. The refreshed Board and management team have led a successful reorientation of
Tivity Health’s strategy, which has included the disposition in December 2020 of Tivity Health’s Nutrition business
acquired via the acquisition of Nutrisystem, Inc. in March 2019, refocusing Tivity Health’s strategy on strengthening
and expanding its core SilverSneakers, Prime Fitness and Whole Health Living brands, and the successful navigation
of the pandemic leading to both recovery of in-person fitness visits to Tivity Health’s gym partners and ongoing
expansion of virtual fitness offerings. These efforts were recognized by the capital markets, leading to a recovery in
Tivity Health’s stock price from a closing price of $5.27 on April 1, 2020, the day before Mr. Sanfilippo was appointed
Chairman, to $25.36 on December 7, 2021, the day before Stone Point Capital provided its initial written indication of
interest in acquiring Tivity Health.
On October 14, 2021, Mr. Ashworth received a telephone call from a representative of a significant stockholder of
Tivity Health (“Stockholder A”) related to contacts such representative had had with Stone Point Capital, an
investment firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The representative of Stockholder A relayed that Stone Point
Capital had been a long-term follower of Tivity Health’s business and may have interest in exploring a potential
strategic transaction. Mr. Ashworth responded that the Board and Tivity Health were always receptive to stockholder
feedback and to exploring opportunities to create additional value for stockholders, and confirmed to the
representative of Stockholder A that he would be open to connecting with representatives of Stone Point Capital.
The representative of Stockholder A followed up later that day with an email introduction connecting Mr. Ashworth
with the Stone Point Capital representatives.
On October 28, 2021, Mr. Ashworth and Adam Holland, Chief Financial Officer of Tivity Health, held an initial
telephonic meeting with representatives of Stone Point Capital to discuss publicly available information relating to
Tivity Health’s business and operations, financial performance and strategic direction, and at the end of the
discussion Stone Point Capital expressed interest in exploring a possible strategic transaction between Stone Point
Capital and Tivity Health, including a possible acquisition of Tivity Health by Stone Point Capital. On November 3,
2021, representatives of Stone Point Capital emailed Mr. Ashworth noting their positive view of the October 28
meeting and ongoing interest in maintaining an open dialogue. Subsequent to these interactions, Mr. Ashworth met
with Mr. Sanfilippo, Tivity Health’s independent Chairman, to recount the discussions, and Mr. Sanfilippo directed
Mr. Ashworth to maintain the dialogue with Stone Point Capital and report any material developments to the Board.
On November 16, 2021, at Stone Point Capital’s request, Mr. Ashworth conducted a follow-up call with
representatives of Stone Point Capital and addressed additional questions about Tivity Health’s business, customer
base and strategy. On November 18, 2021, a call to discuss further follow-up questions about Tivity Health’s
business, customer base and strategy was conducted by Mr. Ashworth and Mr. Holland with representatives of
Stone Point Capital and on November 23, 2021, a similar call was conducted with Stone Point Capital by Messrs.
Ashworth and Holland, along with Jeremy Kunicki, Tivity Health’s Senior Vice President of Corporate Development,
and Chris Morrison, Tivity Health’s Senior Vice President of Strategic Management. In each of these meetings,
information provided by representatives of Tivity Health was limited to publicly available information.
33TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 29, 2021, Messrs. Ashworth, Holland, Kunicki and Morrison met with representatives of Stone Point
Capital in Nashville, Tennessee over dinner for further discussions of publicly available information about Tivity
Health’s business and strategy, as well as possible business opportunities with Stone Point Capital’s portfolio
companies. On December 1, 2021, representatives of Stone Point Capital contacted Mr. Ashworth by telephone to
note their positive view of the November 29 discussion and to request a group call that would include
representatives of certain of Stone Point Capital’s portfolio companies. On December 3, 2021, Messrs. Ashworth and
Holland held a call with representatives of Stone Point Capital and one of Stone Point Capital’s portfolio companies
to discuss publicly available information about Tivity Health and potential strategic opportunities. Subsequent to
these interactions, Mr. Ashworth spoke with Mr. Sanfilippo by telephone to recount the discussions, and Mr.
Sanfilippo directed Mr. Ashworth to continue the dialogue with Stone Point Capital and report any material
developments to the Board.
On December 8, 2021, representatives of Stone Point Capital contacted Mr. Ashworth by telephone to inform him of
their intention to convey to him, on behalf of the Board, a letter indicating their interest in acquiring Tivity Health. Mr.
Ashworth acknowledged the information and committed to review any proposal with the Board. Following the call,
representatives of Stone Point Capital emailed to Mr. Ashworth their letter, indicating an interest in acquiring Tivity
Health for an indicative price of $33.00 in cash per outstanding share of Tivity Health Common Stock, representing an
approximate 30% premium to the closing price of $25.36 on December 7, 2021. Stone Point Capital’s offer
contemplated no financing condition but was expressly subject to the completion of due diligence review and final
approvals from both parties. Mr. Ashworth promptly conveyed Stone Point Capital’s letter to Mr. Sanfilippo and the
other members of the Board.
On December 9, 2021, representatives of Lazard, Tivity Health’s historical financial advisor, acting on the direction of
Messrs. Sanfilippo and Ashworth, held a telephonic meeting with representatives of Stone Point Capital to ask
clarifying questions about the indication of interest for the benefit of the Board’s review of the proposal, including
Stone Point Capital’s potential plans for the overall transaction timetable, due diligence investigation and financing.
On December 10, 2021, representatives of Stone Point Capital contacted Mr. Ashworth by telephone and inquired as
to the status and timing of the Board’s response, and Mr. Ashworth informed them that the Board would convene a
meeting later in the month and respond to their proposal in due course. With the information gathered from these
discussions with Stone Point Capital, Messrs. Sanfilippo and Ashworth conferred individually with the other Board
members to prepare for a Board meeting later in December to consider the proposal. In preparation for that meeting,
Mr. Sanfilippo directed Messrs. Ashworth and Holland to work with the management team to finalize management’s
long-term forecast, building on the forecast work that was already underway as part of management’s normal-course
year-end process, for presentation to the Board as part of its consideration of the proposal. Management continued
developing the long-term forecast over the succeeding two weeks.
On December 22, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, with representatives of Tivity Health’s senior
management, Lazard and Tivity Health’s outside counsel Bass, Berry & Sims PLC (“Bass Berry”) present, to review
Stone Point Capital’s proposal. Tivity Health’s senior management began by presenting to the Board management’s
current forecasted financial information for Tivity Health’s business through the end of fiscal 2027 and underlying
assumptions. Following discussion, the Board adopted the long-term forecast proposed by management which is
discussed in the section entitled “The Merger-Projections Prepared by Tivity Health’s Management” beginning on
page 54 of this Proxy Statement. Representatives of Bass Berry reviewed for the Board the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable law in the context of Stone Point Capital’s proposal. Representatives of Lazard then reviewed Stone
Point Capital’s proposal against several preliminary valuation methodologies, including a preliminary analysis of
discounted cash flows based on management’s long-range forecast. Representatives of Lazard also reviewed Stone
Point Capital’s history of making large-scale acquisitions of this type and its likely ability to finance the transaction at
the valuation implied by Stone Point Capital’s indicative proposal.
Representatives of Lazard then reviewed potential process considerations for the Board in determining whether to
pursue further Stone Point Capital’s proposal and, if the Board should direct it, outreach to other potentially
interested parties-including both financial sponsors and strategic buyers-to gauge interest from others in a possible
acquisition of Tivity Health. Representatives of Lazard and Bass Berry responded to questions from the Board
relating to the structure and timing of such a process. The representatives of Lazard discussed with the Board the
risks and benefits of various market check strategies, from a full public auction-style solicitation of
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
interest, to a targeted outreach to a list of selected potential buyers likely to have both potential interest and the
ability to complete a transaction, to a single-bidder strategy of continuing discussions solely with Stone Point Capital
with no outreach to other parties. Following this discussion, the Board determined that a program of robust outreach
to a significant number of potentially interested parties was the optimal approach for maximizing potential value and
identifying as many interested parties as would be feasible. The Lazard representatives reviewed with the Board a list
of potentially interested counterparties, which included both financial sponsors and strategic counterparties. The list
of strategic counterparties was smaller in number than financial sponsors, given the Board and management’s input
as to which strategic counterparties were either competitors or significant customers of Tivity Health, as well as
Lazard’s view as to which potential counterparties were of sufficient scale to execute a transaction of the potential
size being contemplated. The Board further directed Lazard and Bass Berry to negotiate a suitable non-disclosure
agreement with Stone Point Capital and, thereafter, to share certain nonpublic information about Tivity Health,
including the long-range forecast, and to schedule a meeting between Stone Point Capital and Tivity Health’s
management team in January 2022 to review such information. The Board also directed Lazard to prepare for outreach
to the potentially interested parties beginning early in 2022 as discussed.
At its December 22, 2021 meeting, the Board also met in executive session and approved the formal engagement of
Lazard to act as Tivity Health’s financial advisor in connection with the proposal from Stone Point Capital and the
review of strategic alternatives by the Board. Lazard was selected by the Board because of, among other reasons,
Lazard’s significant experience advising public companies on strategic transactions in the healthcare and consumer
industries, Lazard’s familiarity with Tivity Health and its strategy, and Lazard’s previous work as Tivity Health’s
financial advisor in connection with the successful disposition of the Nutrition business in 2020.
On December 23, 2021, Mr. Ashworth spoke with representatives of Stone Point Capital by telephone and, at the
Board’s direction, conveyed to them the Board’s decision to allow Stone Point Capital to conduct a limited due
diligence review of certain information, subject to execution of a suitable non-disclosure agreement, and the Board’s
intention to undertake a process of evaluating strategic alternatives, including outreach to other parties deemed likely
to have potential interest in a strategic transaction involving Tivity Health, in response to Stone Point Capital’s
proposal.
On December 24, 2021, Stone Point Capital conveyed an initial due diligence request list to Lazard. On December 27,
2021, Lazard conveyed an initial draft of Tivity Health’s non-disclosure agreement containing customary standstill
provisions to Stone Point Capital, which was negotiated between the parties and legal counsel over succeeding days
and executed by Tivity Health and Stone Point Capital on December 30, 2021. Throughout this time and for the
coming weeks, Tivity Health’s management and representatives of Lazard worked to compile due diligence
information responsive to Stone Point Capital’s request and otherwise likely to be of interest to prospective
counterparties into a virtual data room to be shared with any party that may express interest and enter into a suitable
non-disclosure agreement.
On January 7, 2022, Stone Point Capital was granted access to due diligence information through Tivity Health's
virtual data room and commenced due diligence as of that time.
On January 10, 2022, representatives of Lazard began contacting potential counterparties discussed with the Board at
its December 22, 2021 meeting to gauge those parties’ interest in an acquisition of Tivity Health. These contacts and
subsequent discussions took place over a period of several weeks, and ultimately 31 parties including Stone Point
Capital (comprised of 28 financial sponsors and three strategic parties) were contacted by representatives of Lazard,
at the direction of the Board. Following Lazard’s outreach to the three potential strategic acquirers that had been
identified and discussed with the Board (“Strategic Party A, B, and C”), Strategic Party A requested the form of
nondisclosure agreement, which Lazard conveyed to Strategic Party A. Both Strategic Party B and Strategic Party C
declined to enter into a nondisclosure agreement and notified Lazard of their intention not to pursue a transaction
with Tivity Health on February 4, 2022 and January 29, 2022, respectively. In summary, of the 31 parties contacted
including Stone Point Capital, 21 parties (comprised of 20 financial sponsors and one strategic party) entered into
non-disclosure agreements with Tivity Health containing customary standstill provisions and received initial
information, including a confidential information memorandum that contained Tivity Health’s long-range forecast.
Each party executing a non-disclosure agreement was granted access to Tivity Health's virtual data room promptly
after execution. Of the 21 parties that entered into non-disclosure agreements, 15 parties (comprised of 14 financial
sponsors and one strategic party) held limited meetings with management to review the information and ask
questions about Tivity Health’s
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
business, financial performance and strategy. These contacts were conducted pursuant to a process letter authorized
by Tivity Health and circulated by representatives of Lazard to all interested parties, including Stone Point Capital,
noting, among other things, the Board’s expectation that each interested party should submit a written indication of
interest to Tivity Health by February 14, 2022 in order to remain in consideration and be allowed to continue in the
process, if the Board should determine to allow them to do so following review of such party’s indication of interest.
On January 11, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of senior management,
Lazard and Bass Berry present. The Board approved the expansion of the Board and addition of Stephanie Davis
Michelman as a director, effective immediately, and Ms. Michelman joined the meeting after her appointment.
Thereafter, representatives of Lazard provided an update on engagement with Stone Point Capital subsequent to the
previous meeting of the Board, the gathering of due diligence materials and preparation of a confidential information
memorandum for potentially interested parties, and Lazard’s efforts to contact the previously recommended potential
buyers to gauge potential interest. The Lazard representatives also conveyed Stone Point Capital’s request for a
meeting with senior management to review the long-range forecast. The Board also discussed with representatives of
Lazard the possibility of Tivity Health approaching potential lenders to provide an indicative debt financing proposal
that could be shared with potential buyers to illustrate the feasibility and terms that could be available to finance an
acquisition of Tivity Health. Following discussion, the Board directed Lazard and management to proceed with the
proposed meeting with Stone Point Capital, in conjunction with Lazard’s continuing outreach to other potential
counterparties.
On January 13, 2022, Messrs. Ashworth, Holland, Kunicki and Morrison and Raymond Bilbao, Tivity Health’s Chief
Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary, along with representatives of Lazard, held a virtual meeting with
representatives of Stone Point Capital to discuss Tivity Health’s strategy, business performance and prospects.
During the weeks following the January 11 meeting of the Board, discussions continued among Mr. Holland and
other members of the senior management team, as well as consultation with Mr. Sanfilippo, Tivity Health’s
independent Board Chair, and Ms. Russell, the Chair of the Audit Committee, and representatives of Lazard, about
potential lenders that could be approached to provide indicative debt financing proposals for the benefit of
potentially interested parties. At the direction of Tivity Health, Bass Berry prepared a form of non-disclosure
agreement for prospective lenders, and on January 21, 2022 representatives of Lazard shared this non-disclosure
agreement with two prospective lenders, both of whom executed those agreements after negotiation. Subsequently,
one of the lenders provided a financing proposal that was shared with prospective counterparties.
On January 26, 2022, representatives of Lazard, at the direction of the Board, conveyed a confidential information
memorandum containing Tivity Health’s long-range forecast that had been approved by the Board at its meeting on
December 22, 2021 to interested counterparties that were conducting due diligence, including Stone Point Capital.
On January 27, 2022, the Board held a virtual meeting, with representatives of senior management, Lazard and Bass
Berry present. At the meeting, Mr. Ashworth and representatives of Lazard provided an update to the Board on the
process conducted to date, responses of the counterparties contacted as part of the outreach, and the level of
ongoing due diligence efforts for those counterparties that elected to continue participating in the process. The
representatives of Lazard also reviewed the efforts to procure an indicative debt financing package to be shared with
prospective counterparties. Lazard also provided a further update on the efforts of Stone Point Capital, as the party
whose initial indication of interest had commenced the Board’s process.
On January 30, 2022, representatives of Lazard, at the direction of the Board, conveyed a letter to Stone Point Capital
and other counterparties on behalf of Tivity Health noting Tivity Health’s expectation that first round indications of
interest would be expected to be delivered on or before February 14, 2022. The letter noted that any such proposals
would be reviewed by the Board and, if the Board determined to proceed with any party, that party would be
permitted to conduct further due diligence and would be provided with a draft form of merger agreement to inform
second-round proposals.
On February 3, 2022, the Board held a meeting, with representatives of senior management present, to, among other
things, review Tivity Health’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 performance and prepare for the upcoming earnings
release and annual reporting cycle. At that meeting, Mr. Ashworth provided an update to the Board on ongoing due
diligence activity by and upcoming management meetings with interested counterparties.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 4, 2022, the first of the 14 virtual meetings between Tivity Health’s management team and
representatives of Lazard with counterparties other than Stone Point Capital took place. On February 9, 2022, at Stone
Point Capital’s request, a further virtual meeting was held among Messrs. Ashworth, Holland, Kunicki, Morrison, and
Bilbao along with representatives of Lazard, and representatives of Stone Point Capital to discuss follow-up
questions from Stone Point Capital about Tivity Health’s business, strategy, forecast and customer base, among
other matters.
In light of the breadth of interest in the process undertaken by Tivity Health and the resultant risk of a leak despite all
reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality, Tivity Health’s senior management, in consultation with Mr. Sanfilippo
and representatives of Lazard, determined that it would be advisable for Tivity Health to approach Customer A, one
of Tivity Health’s most significant customers, to inform Customer A, on a confidential basis, of the ongoing process
and reassure Customer A of Tivity Health’s commitment to their business relationship. On February 10, 2022, Mr.
Ashworth held a telephone call with a representative of Customer A to discuss these matters and respond to
questions.
On February 11, 2022, Strategic Party A entered into a non-disclosure agreement, and Lazard sent to Strategic Party A
the confidential information memorandum. On February 15, 2022, the last of the 14 management meetings conducted
with counterparties other than Stone Point Capital was conducted.
On February 14, 2022, Tivity Health’s deadline for counterparties to submit first round indications of interest, Stone
Point Capital submitted a further written indication of interest reaffirming the price of $33.00 per share that had been
reflected in its December 8, 2021, letter to Tivity Health. The February 14 Stone Point Capital letter noted that it
remained subject to confirmatory due diligence, but that Stone Point Capital remained highly interested in completing
a transaction with Tivity Health and was prepared to move expeditiously to do so.
None of the other 30 counterparties contacted by Lazard on behalf of Tivity Health submitted a first-round indication
of interest, either by the February 14 deadline or later. On February 16, 2022, Strategic Party A informed Lazard of its
intention not to proceed further with the process. The other parties cited a number of reasons for their decisions not
to pursue the process further, including lack of clear strategic fit with established businesses of their own or of their
portfolio companies; concerns about customer concentration in Tivity Health’s SilverSneakers business; ongoing
concerns about the impact of COVID-19 and resultant changes in consumer behavior on fitness activity, particularly
among seniors; and potential margin compression that could result from these factors and competitive pressures in
the marketplace. Representatives of Lazard transmitted to Tivity Health on February 17, 2022 a written memorandum
disclosing Lazard’s material relationships with respect to Stone Point Capital, which notice Tivity Health promptly
delivered to the Board.
On February 18, 2022, the Board held a virtual meeting, with representatives of senior management, Lazard and Bass
Berry present, to review the results of the first round of the process. Representatives of Lazard again reviewed the
nature of the outreach to potential counterparties and the feedback received from the parties that had determined not
to submit proposals. The Lazard representatives reviewed the Stone Point Capital proposal, noting that it reflected
the same value that Stone Point Capital had put forward on the basis of publicly available information in December,
and compared the proposal to preliminary valuation analyses prepared by Lazard on the basis of Tivity Health’s long-
range forecast, including a preliminary discounted cash flow analysis. The Lazard representatives reviewed potential
process considerations for a second round with Stone Point Capital if the Board determined to continue. Following
discussion with the representatives of senior management and Lazard, the Board unanimously determined to allow
Stone Point Capital to conduct further due diligence and directed Lazard to invite Stone Point Capital to submit a final
indication of interest in March 2022. After this approval, representatives of Bass Berry reviewed a draft Merger
Agreement to be provided to Stone Point Capital in conjunction with its due diligence review. After discussion, the
Board approved the draft Merger Agreement as presented and directed Lazard and Bass Berry to convey it to Stone
Point Capital.
On February 20, 2022, the draft Merger Agreement was made available to Stone Point Capital via Tivity Health’s
virtual data room for the process.
After market close on February 24, 2022, at which time the closing price of Tivity Health Common Stock on Nasdaq
was $26.09 per share, Tivity Health announced its earnings results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021. On
February 25, 2022, the Board held a virtual meeting, with representatives of senior management, Lazard and Bass
Berry present, to discuss, among other things, stockholder interactions surrounding Tivity Health’s earnings
announcement. Mr. Ashworth reported to the Board on stockholder meetings conducted to date
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and others still to come. Representatives of Lazard updated the Board on discussions with Stone Point Capital
following the Board’s previous meeting, including Stone Point Capital’s desire to contact potential financing sources
for the transaction in connection with its confirmatory due diligence review and final bid preparation. After
discussion, the Board directed Lazard to allow Stone Point Capital to contact potential financing sources, subject to
Stone Point Capital allowing Lazard and Tivity Health’s management team to vet all such contacts in advance.
On March 1, 2022, representatives of Tivity Health’s senior management team and Lazard met with representatives of
Stone Point Capital at the offices of Bass Berry in Nashville, Tennessee for an all-day management presentation. In
connection with this meeting, the representatives of Stone Point Capital discussed their desired scope of outreach to
potential sources of financing, and Tivity Health granted permission to begin outreach. The closing price of Tivity
Health Common Stock on Nasdaq on March 1, 2022 was $28.43 per share, an increase of approximately 9% from the
closing price immediately preceding Tivity Health’s earnings announcement the previous week.
On March 2, 2022, Mr. Holland received a call from a longtime contact at one of the financing sources contacted by
Stone Point Capital the previous day inquiring about market rumors relating to Tivity Health and a potential strategic
process. Mr. Holland responded to this inquiry by noting that Tivity Health’s longstanding policy was not to
comment on any such market rumors, and he relayed this information to Mr. Ashworth, representatives of Lazard and
Bass Berry. On March 7, 2022, Tivity Health approved a further Stone Point Capital request to reach out to additional
potential financing sources.
On March 7 through March 18, 2022 representatives of Tivity Health, Lazard and Bass Berry conducted a number of
virtual due diligence meetings with representatives of Stone Point Capital and its advisors, including Stone Point
Capital’s outside counsel, Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland & Ellis”). These sessions covered a variety of matters,
including quality of earnings, financial performance, information technology, legal and tax.
On March 8, 2022, representatives of Lazard conveyed to Stone Point Capital via a process letter the Board’s
expectation that second round proposals would be received no later than March 28, 2022, and that second round
proposals should be accompanied by a markup of the draft Merger Agreement previously provided and commitment
letters for any planned financing.
On March 16, 2022, Tivity Health approved a further Stone Point Capital request to contact seven additional potential
debt financing sources. Tivity Health approved a further request by Stone Point Capital to contact one additional
potential debt financing source on March 20, 2022.
From March 21 through March 24, 2022, representatives of Tivity Health, Lazard and Bass Berry conducted additional
virtual due diligence meetings on additional topics, including Tivity Health’s relationships with health plans, open
due diligence requests and adjustments to the quality of earnings analysis. On March 21, 2022, Messrs. Ashworth
and Holland, along with Tommy Lewis, Tivity Health’s Chief Operating Officer, Jessica Erb, Tivity Health’s Senior Vice
President of Client Relations, Caroline Khalil, Tivity Health’s Senior Vice President of Fitness Operations, and
representatives of Lazard met with senior management of Stone Point Capital in Nashville, Tennessee and discussed
Tivity Health’s business, strategy and operations.
During the week of March 21, 2022, Stone Point Capital conveyed to Lazard an intention to submit a second-round
bid package by the deadline of March 28, 2022, but noted that, due in part to uncertainties in the capital markets
brought about by inflationary price shocks and the ongoing war in Ukraine, they were unlikely to have all of the
financing commitments ready to accompany the bid package by that date. Lazard conveyed this information to
Messrs. Sanfilippo and Ashworth, along with other members of senior management and Bass Berry.
On March 22, 2022, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis and Bass Berry conducted a telephone call in which Kirkland
& Ellis conveyed their expectation to send to Bass Berry imminently a markup of the draft Merger Agreement
reflecting Stone Point Capital’s preliminary positions on certain terms and conditions. Later that evening, Kirkland &
Ellis sent the markup to Bass Berry. On March 25, 2022, Bass Berry and Kirkland & Ellis conducted a videoconference
in which Bass Berry asked clarifying questions about some of the positions taken in the markup ahead of the
deadline of March 28, 2022. The trading price of Tivity Health Common Stock on Nasdaq closed at $29.69 on March
25, 2022.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On March 27, 2022, representatives of Stone Point Capital and Lazard spoke by telephone, and Stone Point Capital
again noted an intent to deliver a bid package the next day, but likely with debt financing commitment papers to
follow at a date soon thereafter.
On March 28, 2022, Stone Point Capital delivered to Lazard an updated proposal letter, along with a markup of the
Merger Agreement, an equity commitment letter and limited guarantee from Stone Point Capital affiliates supporting
the transaction. The proposal letter reflected a price of $31.50 per share, a decrease of $1.50 per share from the $33.00
proposal price in each of Stone Point Capital’s December 2021 and February 2022 letters. Stone Point Capital noted to
Lazard that the primary reason for this decrease was an increase in costs of financing that Stone Point Capital
expected to incur for the transaction, in large part due to the deterioration in the financing markets subsequent to the
delivery of its earlier proposals, as a result of increased Federal Reserve focus on taming near- and intermediate-term
inflation and recessionary risks. Representatives of Lazard conveyed the bid package to the Board that day. Given
the incompleteness of the proposal without debt financing commitments and lack of certainty as to when it would be
available, however, after consulting with other members of the Board, Mr. Sanfilippo determined not to schedule a
meeting of the Board to review the proposal until such time as the debt commitment was received.
During the week of March 28, 2022, Tivity Health Common Stock continued to trade upward on Nasdaq, closing at
$29.80 on Monday, March 28 and rising to $32.61 by Friday, April 1. On March 30, 2022, Tivity Health Common Stock
closed at $32.09. That same day, Stone Point Capital conveyed to Lazard an executed debt commitment letter from its
financing sources in support of the transaction, and Lazard relayed the debt commitment letter to the Board,
management, and Bass Berry.
On the morning of April 3, 2022, the Board conducted a virtual meeting, attended by representatives of senior
management, Lazard and Bass Berry, to review Stone Point Capital’s offer. Representatives of Lazard reviewed the
Stone Point Capital $31.50 proposal and again compared it to updated preliminary valuation analyses, including a
discounted cash flow analysis, as well as comparative stock price analysis, and other measures. In connection with
discussing the assumptions underlying these valuation methodologies, representatives of senior management
confirmed that there had been no developments that had changed management’s view of the long-range forecast or
caused management to believe that it should be revised or replaced as a basis for Lazard’s valuation analysis and the
Board’s evaluation of the Stone Point Capital proposal. The Lazard representatives also reviewed the financing
package put forward by Stone Point Capital and discussed Stone Point Capital’s rationale for the lowering of its
proposal price given deterioration in the financing markets.
The Lazard representatives further reviewed information regarding the trading metrics of Tivity Health Common Stock
that informed Lazard’s view that the trading price of Tivity Health Common Stock may have been inflated by market
rumors of the transaction, including stock price increases in early March after Stone Point Capital’s outreach to
potential debt financing sources was conducted, and a further increase during the week of trading after the March 28
proposal date, in which trading prices were approaching the original $33.00 price reflected in Stone Point Capital’s
first two proposal letters. Representatives of Bass Berry discussed the Board’s fiduciary duties under Delaware law
and reviewed open issues presented by the proposal draft from Stone Point Capital, including a proposed termination
fee payable by Tivity Health under certain circumstances of 3.5% of equity value, and a proposed reverse termination
fee of 4.75% of equity value payable by Stone Point Capital under certain circumstances and serving as an overall
cap on damages for any breach, including any willful breach, of the Merger Agreement by Stone Point Capital.
Representatives of Bass Berry and Lazard discussed the range of termination and reverse termination fees in
precedent transactions. Representatives of Lazard and Bass Berry then reviewed potential counterproposals that the
Board could make if it determined to continue discussions with Stone Point Capital. After discussion of various
alternatives, the Board unanimously approved a direction to Mr. Ashworth and Lazard to convey a counterproposal
to Stone Point Capital including a price of $33.25 per share, a termination fee of 2.75% of equity value, a reverse
termination fee of 7.25% of equity value, and without capping damages at the reverse termination fee amount in the
event of Stone Point Capital’s willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement. The Board directed Bass Berry to
deliver to Kirkland & Ellis revised drafts of all transaction documents as promptly as possible after the counteroffer
could be conveyed.
At approximately noon on April 3, 2022, Mr. Ashworth and representatives of Lazard spoke with representatives of
Stone Point Capital and conveyed the Board’s counteroffer, and Tivity Health’s willingness to work quickly to reach
agreement on those terms. The Stone Point Capital representatives confirmed their understanding of the
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
counteroffer and committed to respond after further consideration, including from Stone Point Capital’s investment
committee. Shortly after the conclusion of this discussion, Bass Berry conveyed to Kirkland & Ellis revised drafts of
the Merger Agreement and all other major transaction documents.
During the evening of April 3, 2022, representatives of Stone Point Capital conveyed to Mr. Ashworth by telephone
that they would not be in a position to respond to the Board’s counteroffer that day, and would communicate a
response to him when ready. Mr. Ashworth updated the Board by email that Stone Point Capital would not be
providing a response to the Board’s counteroffer that evening.
On the morning of April 4, 2022, representatives of Stone Point Capital contacted Mr. Ashworth and Lazard and
informed them of a further counterproposal, including a price of $32.00 per share, a termination fee of 3.25% of equity
value and a reverse termination fee of 6.5% of equity value, which would also serve as a cap on damages for willful
and material breach of the Merger Agreement by Stone Point Capital. Mr. Ashworth and Lazard committed to convey
this to the Board later that same day.
On April 4, 2022, the closing price of Tivity Health Common Stock on Nasdaq was $32.25. Shortly after the close of
trading on Nasdaq that day, the Board held a virtual meeting attended by representatives of senior management,
Lazard and Bass Berry to review the revised proposal from Stone Point Capital. Representatives of Lazard reviewed
the revised offer and noted that the price remained within the range implied by the discounted cash flows analysis,
among other valuation analyses, that Lazard had conducted based on Tivity Health’s long-range forecast. After
discussion, the Board directed Mr. Ashworth and Lazard to convey a further counteroffer to include a price of $32.65
and accepting of the other positions put forward by Stone Point Capital on the termination fees.
In the early evening of April 4, 2022, Mr. Ashworth and representatives of Lazard spoke with representatives of Stone
Point Capital by telephone and conveyed the Board’s revised counteroffer. The Stone Point Capital representatives
confirmed their understanding of the counteroffer and committed to give the counteroffer further consideration,
including by Stone Point Capital’s investment committee.
Later in the evening of April 4, 2022, representatives of Stone Point Capital spoke by telephone with Mr. Ashworth
and representatives of Lazard and conveyed a “best and final” revised proposal of $32.50 per share. Mr. Ashworth
committed to present the revised proposal to the Board and respond promptly.
Still later in the evening of April 4, 2022, the Board held a virtual meeting, with representatives of senior management,
Lazard and Bass Berry present, to review the revised proposal from Stone Point Capital. After discussion, the Board
unanimously determined to accept the proposed price of $32.50 and directed management, Lazard and Bass Berry to
convey this agreement to Stone Point Capital and to work through the night to finalize all transaction documentation
ahead of a Board meeting the following morning to consider the transaction for final approval.
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Ashworth and representatives of Lazard conveyed the Board’s position to representatives of
Stone Point Capital, and throughout the night of April 4, 2022, representatives of Tivity Health, Lazard, Bass Berry,
Stone Point Capital and Kirkland & Ellis worked to finalize all transaction terms. Early in the morning of April 5, 2022,
before the opening of Nasdaq for trading, the Board met (the “April 5 Meeting”) to consider the Merger Agreement
and other transaction documentation in final form. Representatives of Lazard presented materials reviewing Stone
Point Capital’s proposal, certain trading metrics of Tivity Health Common Stock that informed Lazard’s view that the
trading price may have been inflated by market rumors of the transaction, and Lazard’s financial analysis of the
Merger and delivered Lazard's oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
as of April 5, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review described in such opinion,
the Transaction Consideration to be paid to holders of Tivity Health Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) in
the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
For a detailed discussion of Lazard’s opinion, please see below under the caption “The Merger-Opinion of Tivity
Health’s Financial Advisor”. Representatives of Bass Berry reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties and a
summary of the key terms of a substantially final version of the Merger Agreement that had been negotiated with
Stone Point Capital in connection with the proposed transaction. After further discussion of the proposed
transaction (see below under the captions “The Merger-Recommendation of the Board of Directors
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and Reasons for the Merger”), the Board unanimously adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement,
declared that the Merger Agreement was in the best interests of Tivity Health and its stockholders, and
recommended that Tivity Health’s stockholders approve the Merger Agreement. The Board directed representatives
of Bass Berry to continue to finalize the terms of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the summary of terms
reviewed with the Board.
Following the April 5 Meeting, the parties finalized and executed the Merger Agreement and the schedules thereto
and received executed final copies of the limited guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter, and the Debt Commitment
Letter.
On the morning of April 5, 2022, prior to the opening of trading of Tivity Health Common Stock on Nasdaq, Tivity
Health and Stone Point Capital issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.
Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger
Recommendation of the Board to Adopt the Merger Agreement, Thereby Approving the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement
On April 5, 2022, the Board, after considering various factors, including those described in this section below, and
after consultation with Tivity Health’s outside legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) determined that the terms
of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best
interests of, Tivity Health and its stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best interests of Tivity Health and its
stockholders to enter into, and approved, adopted and declared advisable, the Merger Agreement, (iii) approved the
execution and delivery by Tivity Health of the Merger Agreement, the performance by Tivity Health of its covenants
and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained therein, (iv) directed that the approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to the
stockholders of Tivity Health, and (v) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Tivity Health vote in favor of
the approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the adoption of
the Merger Agreement.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote (i) “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby
approving the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) “FOR” the non-
binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be payable by Tivity Health to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger and contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (iii) “FOR” the
proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the
Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is not initially obtained.
Reasons for the Merger
In recommending that Tivity Health’s stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to approve the adoption of the
Merger Agreement, the Board, including its independent directors, considered a number of potentially positive
factors, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative
importance):
•
Attractive Value. The Board believed that the Transaction Consideration represents attractive value for the
shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, based on, among other things, the Board’s familiarity with Tivity
Health’s current and historical financial condition, results of operations, business, competitive position and
prospects, as well as Tivity Health’s business plan and potential long-term value; and, after a thorough
review of the process conducted, the Board determined that $32.50 per share in cash pursuant to the terms
of the Merger Agreement affords the best value reasonably available for holders of Tivity Health Common
Stock.
•
Form of Consideration. The Board considered that the Transaction Consideration is all cash, which
provides stockholders certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, as
compared to stock consideration whose value fluctuates, while eliminating exposure to long term business
and execution risks.
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Risks Inherent in Tivity Health’s Business Plan; Strategic Alternatives. The Board considered Tivity
Health’s historical results of operations, recent reorientation of strategy following leadership changes at
both the Board and senior management levels beginning in 2020, short-term and long-term strategic goals
and the Tivity Health Projections (which are described in the section entitled “The Merger-Projections
Prepared by Tivity Health’s Management” beginning on page 54 of this Proxy Statement) and the perceived
challenges and risks associated with Tivity Health’s ability to meet the Tivity Health Projections in light of
the heavily competitive senior fitness landscape; the considerable degree of customer concentration in
Tivity Health’s SilverSneakers business; the potential for ongoing, and possibly increasing, pressure on
Tivity Health’s pricing and margins in its core businesses as a result of the foregoing factors; the ongoing
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; the fact that the recent reorientation of Tivity Health’s strategy meant
that several key strategic initiatives were still in their nascency and had not yet demonstrated a track record
of delivering proven long-term results; and Tivity Health’s uncertain ability to retain management talent in
an intensely competitive market environment, as well as the risks and uncertainties described in the “risk
factors” and “forward looking statements” sections of Tivity Health’s disclosures filed with the SEC,
including that Tivity Health’s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially and adversely
from the projected results. Following such review, the Board determined that the combination of value and
certainty offered to Tivity Health’s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement is more favorable to
Tivity Health’s stockholders than the alternative of remaining an independent public company, along with
the risks inherent in doing so.
•
Premium to Market Prices. The Board considered that the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share in
cash, to be received by the holders of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock in the Merger, represents a
significant premium over the market price at which shares of Tivity Health Common Stock traded at times
before receipt of the Stone Point Capital Proposal. The Board further considered the possibility that the
prevailing trading price of Tivity Health Common Stock immediately prior to execution of the Merger
Agreement may have been inflated by market rumors of the potential transaction, borne out by stock price
increases in early March after Stone Point Capital’s lender outreach was conducted, and a further increase
during the week of trading after the March 28 proposal date, in which trading prices were approaching the
original $33.00 price reflected in Stone Point Capital’s first two proposal letters. From February 28, 2022, the
day prior to Stone Point Capital’s initial lender outreach, to April 4, 2022, Tivity Health’s stock price had
increased approximately 18%, while the S&P 500 had increased approximately 5% and the Nasdaq increased
approximately 6% over the same span. The Board’s considerations included that the Transaction
Consideration of $32.50 per share represents a premium of:
•
approximately 28% over the closing stock price on December 7, 2021, the last trading day prior to the
$33.00 per share unsolicited proposal from Stone Point Capital;
•
approximately 31% over the closing stock price on January 7, 2022, the last trading day prior to the
commencement of outreach to potential buyers;
•
approximately 19% over the closing stock price on February 28, 2022, the last trading day prior to the
commencement of Stone Point Capital’s outreach to potential debt financing sources; and
•
approximately 18% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Tivity Health Common
Stock during the 90-day period ended April 4, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of
the proposed Merger.
•
Valuation Multiple. The Board considered that the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share in cash,
to be received by the holders of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock in the Merger, represents a
valuation of Tivity Health at a multiple of approximately 12.1 times Tivity Health’s last twelve-month
(“LTM”) Adjusted EBITDA for the period ending March 31, 2022.
•
Financial Analyses and Opinion of Lazard. The Board considered the financial analyses of Lazard and the
opinion of Lazard, dated April 5, 2022, to the Board to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Lazard’s
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
opinion, the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 in cash per share to be received by Tivity Health
stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as described in the
section entitled “The Merger-Opinion of Tivity Health’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 46 of this
Proxy Statement.
•
Robust Market Check. The Board considered that, following receipt by Tivity Health on December 7, 2021
of Stone Point Capital’s initial written proposal, Tivity Health, acting at the Board’s direction and with the
assistance of Lazard as its independent financial advisor, identified and discussed possible interest in a
potential transaction with 31 potential bidders including Stone Point Capital (comprised of 28 financial
sponsors and three strategic parties) that the Board, with the assistance of Lazard, determined would be
most likely to have sufficient financial capacity and industry experience and/or overlap with Tivity Health’s
business to have the capability and interest to execute a transaction but were not also either competitors or
significant customers of Tivity Health. Of these, 21 parties (comprised of 20 financial sponsors and one
strategic party) entered into non-disclosure agreements with Tivity Health and received initial information,
including a confidential information memorandum that contained Tivity Health’s long-range forecast. Of
those, 15 parties (comprised of 14 financial sponsors and one strategic party) held limited meetings with
management to review the information and ask questions about Tivity Health’s business, financial
performance and strategy. Further, at the direction of the Board, and with the assistance of Lazard, Tivity
Health secured and shared with potential bidders an indicative debt financing proposal to illustrate the
feasibility and potentially available terms for financing an acquisition of Tivity Health. Following
discussions with such counterparties and groups, none of the counterparties other than Stone Point
Capital was willing to submit a written indication of interest in a strategic transaction with Tivity Health, let
alone on terms and conditions more favorable than those offered by Stone Point Capital.
•
Timing of Closing. The Board considered that the Merger is anticipated to be completed during or prior to
the third quarter of 2022, a relatively expedient timeframe for closing that would mitigate the potential risks
to the business during the interim operating period, including due to uncertainties experienced by clients,
employees and other stakeholders.
•
Arms-Length Negotiations. The Board considered that the Board and Tivity Health’s senior management,
in coordination with Tivity Health’s independent legal and financial advisors, vigorously negotiated on an
arms-length basis with Stone Point Capital with respect to price and other terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, including obtaining a price increase of $1.00 from the price of $31.50 per share
proposed by Stone Point Capital’s final indication of interest as reflected in its letter of March 28, 2022 to a
price of $32.50 per share pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and the Board’s belief that it had negotiated
the best value and terms reasonably attainable from Stone Point Capital.
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including
the respective representations, warranties, covenants and termination rights of the parties and the
termination fees payable by Tivity Health and Parent, are reasonable and customary. The Board also
believed that the terms of the Merger Agreement included the most favorable terms reasonably attainable
from Stone Point Capital.
•
Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger; Likelihood of Closing. The Board considered the
likelihood of satisfaction of conditions to closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement in light of the conditions in the Merger Agreement to the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub.
•
Regulatory Considerations. The Board considered that, while the closing of the Merger is subject to
certain regulatory approvals, there are not likely to be significant antitrust or other regulatory impediments
to the closing of the Merger given the asset mix of Stone Point Capital’s portfolio companies. The Board
also considered that the Merger Agreement requires that Parent and Merger Sub agree to take promptly
any and all steps necessary or reasonably advisable or as may be required by any governmental authority
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any antitrust laws that may
be required by any governmental authority so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, as
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
expeditiously as possible (and in any event at least five (5) business days prior to the “End Date” (i.e.,
12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on October 5, 2022)), including the actions described in the section entitled
“Terms of the Merger Agreement-Efforts to Close the Merger” beginning on page 82 of this Proxy
Statement.
•
Financing; No Financing Condition. The Board considered Parent’s and Merger Sub’s representations
and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement relating to the financing commitments from affiliates of
Stone Point Capital, the delivery by Parent of a debt commitment letter by nationally reputable financial
institutions (and the terms and conditions thereof) and that the Merger is not subject to a financing
condition. Further, the Board considered that under specified circumstances, the Merger Agreement
permits Tivity Health to seek specific performance against Parent and Merger Sub with respect to the
financing commitments, including under Tivity Health’s third-party beneficiary rights pursuant to the
equity commitment letter provided by certain affiliates of Stone Point Capital.
•
Reverse Termination Fee. The Board considered the ability of Tivity Health to, under certain
circumstances, receive a reverse termination fee of approximately $100.4 million, plus up to $7.5 million in
enforcement costs, as described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees”
beginning on page 88 of this Proxy Statement.
•
Ability to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Takeover Proposals. The Board considered that, while the
Merger Agreement restricts Tivity Health’s ability to solicit competing bids to acquire Tivity Health, the
Board has rights, under certain circumstances, to engage in discussions with, and provide information to,
third parties submitting unsolicited takeover proposals and to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to
enter into an alternative acquisition agreement that the Board determines to reflect a superior proposal,
subject to payment of a termination fee of approximately $54.4 million. The Board further considered that
the timing of the Merger would provide ample opportunity for any third parties to submit proposals and
that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the size of the termination fee (which is consistent with
or below fees in comparable transactions), would be unlikely to deter such third parties from submitting
such proposals.
•
Change of Recommendation. The Board considered that it has the right to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change to Tivity Health’s stockholders in the event of a superior proposal or an
intervening event if the Board reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent
with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to payment of a termination fee of
approximately $54.4 million if Parent and Merger Sub terminate the Merger Agreement in response to such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
•
Stockholder Approval. The Board considered that the consummation of the Merger is subject to the
approval of Tivity Health’s stockholders, who will have the opportunity to adopt or reject the Merger
Agreement.
•
Appraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights with respect to the Merger for
Tivity Health stockholders who properly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these
stockholders the ability to seek and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the “fair value” of their
shares at the completion of the Merger, as described in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning
on page 95 of this Proxy Statement.
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board also considered and balanced against the potentially positive factors a number of uncertainties, risks and
other potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in
order of relative importance):
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered that Tivity Health’s
stockholders will lose the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value that could occur if Tivity
Health continued as an independent public company and was able to successfully execute on its current
strategy.
•
Impact of Announcement on Tivity Health. The Board considered that the announcement and pendency of
the Merger, or the failure to consummate the Merger, may disrupt Tivity Health’s business operations or
divert employees’ attention away from Tivity Health’s day-to-day operations, result in significant costs to
Tivity Health or harm Tivity Health’s relationships with its employees and customers.
•
Tax Treatment. The Board considered that the all-cash transaction would be taxable to holders of Tivity
Health Common Stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
Closing Certainty. The Board considered that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’
obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied.
•
Pre-Closing Covenants. The Board considered the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on Tivity Health’s
conduct of business prior to completion of the Merger, which could delay or prevent Tivity Health from
undertaking business opportunities that may arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations
during the pendency of the Merger without Parent’s consent.
•
No Solicitation. The Board considered the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on Tivity Health’s ability
to solicit competing bids to acquire Tivity Health during the pendency of the Merger and that, subject to
certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, in the event of Tivity Health’s receipt of a Company
Superior Proposal, Tivity Health is required to negotiate in good faith with Parent (if requested by Parent)
regarding revisions to the Merger Agreement, which the Board must take into account in determining
whether to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such Company Superior
Proposal.
•
Adverse Recommendation Change. The Board considered the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the
Board’s ability to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and that, subject to certain
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, in the event of a potential Company Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Board, Tivity Health is required to negotiate in good faith with Parent (if
requested by Parent) regarding revisions to the Merger Agreement, which the Board must take into
account in determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
•
Termination Fee. The Board considered the termination fee of approximately $54.4 million that could
become payable to Parent under specified circumstances, including upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a Company Superior
Proposal, which may discourage third parties that might otherwise have an interest in a business
combination with, or acquisition of, Tivity Health from making unsolicited proposals (although the Board
concluded that the termination fee is reasonable in amount, consistent with or below fees in comparable
transactions and will not unduly deter any other party that might be interested in acquiring Tivity Health).
•
Limited Specific Performance Remedy; Reverse Termination Fee. The Board considered that Parent and
Merger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets other than equity and debt commitments,
and that, notwithstanding Tivity Health’s specific performance remedy under the Merger Agreement, Tivity
Health’s remedy in the event of breach of the Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub may be limited to
receipt of the reverse termination fee provided under the Merger Agreement, which is guaranteed by
certain affiliates of Stone Point Capital, and that the reverse termination fee is not available in all instances
where the Merger Agreement may be terminated and may not sufficiently compensate Tivity Health for
adverse effects arising out of such termination of the Merger Agreement.

•
Cap on Damages. The Board considered that Stone Point Capital’s aggregate monetary damages under the
Merger Agreement cannot exceed approximately $100.4 million plus up to $7.5 million in reimbursement of
Tivity Health’s enforcement costs, if applicable.
•
Loss of Key Personnel. The Board considered the risk that, despite retention efforts prior to consummation
of the Merger, Tivity Health may lose key personnel.
•
Litigation. The Board considered the risk of potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be
instituted against Tivity Health or its directors and officers, and the potential effects of any outcomes
related thereto.
•
Expenses. The Board considered the risk that, if the Merger is not consummated, Tivity Health will, with
certain exceptions, be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger Agreement and the
Merger.
•
Director and Officer Interests. The Board considered that Tivity Health’s directors and officers may have
interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Tivity Health stockholders
generally, as described in the sections entitled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management” and “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the
Merger” beginning on pages 93 and 56 of this Proxy Statement, respectively.
•
Forward-Looking Statements. The Board considered risks of the type and nature described in the section
entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”, beginning on page 25 of this
Proxy Statement.
After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the risks,
uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger were outweighed by the
potential benefits of, and potentially positive factors associated with, the Merger to Tivity Health’s stockholders.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the
material factors considered by the Board. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with their
evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify
or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching their determinations and
recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the
process and may have given different weight to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its
ultimate determinations. The Board based its recommendations on the totality of the information presented,
including thorough discussions with, and questioning of, Tivity Health’s senior management and the Board’s
independent legal and financial advisors. This explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information
presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the
section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 25 of this
Proxy Statement.
Opinion of Tivity Health’s Financial Advisor
Tivity Health retained Lazard to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. In connection with this
engagement, Tivity Health requested that Lazard evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of
Tivity Health Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) of the Transaction Consideration to be paid to such
holders in the Merger. On April 5, 2022, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, Lazard rendered to the Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
April 5, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken described in such opinion,
the Transaction Consideration to be paid to holders of Tivity Health Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) in
the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated April 5, 2022, which describes the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B and
is incorporated by reference in this document. The summary of the written opinion of Lazard, dated April 5, 2022,
set forth in this Proxy Statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Lazard’s opinion attached as Annex B. Lazard’s opinion was for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) and
Lazard’s opinion was rendered to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and did not address any
terms or other aspects (other than the Transaction Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s
opinion) of the Merger. Lazard’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other
transaction or business strategy in which Tivity Health might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by
Tivity Health to engage in the Merger. Lazard’s opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation
to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any matter relating
thereto.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Lazard, among other things:
•
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft dated April 4, 2022 of the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Tivity Health;
•
reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to Lazard by Tivity Health relating to the
business of Tivity Health and extrapolations thereto based on the guidance of management of Tivity Health
and approved by the Board (the “Tivity Health Projections”);
•
held discussions with members of the senior management of Tivity Health with respect to the business and
prospects of Tivity Health;
•
reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business that Lazard
believed to be generally relevant in evaluating the business of Tivity Health;
•
reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business that
Lazard believed to be comparable in certain respects to the business of Tivity Health;
•
reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Tivity Health Common Stock; and
•
conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Lazard deemed appropriate.
Lazard assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent
verification of such information. Lazard did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets
or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Tivity Health or concerning the solvency or fair value of Tivity Health, and
Lazard was not furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecasts utilized in
Lazard’s analyses, Lazard assumed, with the consent of Tivity Health, that they had been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of Tivity
Health. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on
which they are based.
Further, Lazard’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to Lazard as of, the date of its opinion. In addition, Lazard noted that the current
volatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets relating to, among others, the COVID-19 pandemic and
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have an effect on Tivity Health and Lazard did not express an opinion as to the
effects of such volatility or such disruption on Tivity Health.
Lazard assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring
after the date of its opinion. Lazard did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the Merger. In addition, Lazard’s opinion
did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which
Tivity Health might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by Tivity Health to engage in the Merger.
In rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Board, that the Merger will be consummated on the
terms described in the Merger Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions.
Representatives of Tivity Health advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed, that the Merger Agreement, when executed,
would conform to the draft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects. Lazard also assumed, with the consent of the
Board, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the Merger
will not have an adverse effect on Tivity Health or the Merger. Lazard did not express any opinion as to any tax or
other consequences that might result from the Merger, nor did Lazard’s opinion
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Lazard understood that Tivity Health obtained
such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to any
terms or other aspects (other than the Transaction Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s
opinion) of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any agreements or
arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the Merger. In addition, Lazard expressed no view
or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any
officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Transaction
Consideration or otherwise.
Summary of the Financial Analyses of Tivity Health’s Financial Advisor
In preparing its opinion to the Board, Lazard performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The summary
set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors
considered by, and underlying Lazard’s opinion, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the
relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses. The preparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a
complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion or
analysis is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Lazard considered the results of
all of the analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with
regard to any particular factor or method of analysis considered by it. Rather, Lazard made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.
Accordingly, Lazard believes that its analyses and factors summarized below must be considered as a whole and in
context. Lazard further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information
presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses
and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.
In performing its analyses, Lazard considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of Tivity
Health. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Tivity Health or its
business or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the
analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning business, financial and operating characteristics
and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or
transactions reviewed or views regarding the comparability of such companies, businesses or transactions.
Accordingly, such analyses may not necessarily include all companies, businesses or transactions that could be
deemed relevant. The estimates of the future performance of Tivity Health in or underlying Lazard’s analyses and the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive
of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested
by the analyses. These estimates are necessarily subject to uncertainty because, among other things, they are based
upon numerous factors and events beyond the control of Tivity Health and its advisors. In addition, analyses
relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a
company may actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future.
Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular
analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken as the views of
Lazard regarding the actual values of Tivity Health. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information,
to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before April 5, 2022, and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Lazard did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the
Merger. The type and amount of Transaction Consideration payable in the Merger was determined through
negotiations between Tivity Health and Stone Point Capital rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved
by the Board. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. Lazard’s opinion and
analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the Merger and the Transaction
Consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board or management with respect to
the Merger or the Transaction Consideration payable in the Merger.

Financial Analyses
The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled “Opinion of Tivity Health’s Financial
Advisor - Financial Analyses” is a summary of the material financial analyses provided by Lazard in connection
with its opinion, dated April 5, 2022, to the Board. The summary set forth below is not a comprehensive description
of all analyses undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of the analyses in the
summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The financial analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Lazard’s financial
analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses performed by Lazard. Considering the data set forth in the tables
below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses
performed by Lazard. Future results may differ from those described and such differences may be material.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Tivity Health by calculating, based on the Tivity Health
Projections, the estimated present value (as of March 31, 2022) of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows
(inclusive of the impact of Tivity Health’s net operating loss carryforwards) that Tivity Health was forecasted to
generate during Tivity Health’s fiscal years 2022 through 2032. Lazard also calculated a range of implied terminal
values for Tivity Health by applying perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%, which range was selected based on
Lazard’s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows
that Tivity Health was forecasted to generate. The cash flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted
to present value as of March 31, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 10.00% to 11.00%, derived based on a
weighted average cost of capital calculation. Based on this range of implied enterprise values and Tivity Health’s
estimated net debt as of March 31, 2022 (calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and less the value of
Tivity Health’s equity stake in Sharecare, Inc.), this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of
Tivity Health Common Stock of $26.95 to $33.90 (rounded to the nearest $0.05) compared to the Transaction
Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock.1
Selected Public Company Trading Analysis
Using public filings and other publicly available information, Lazard compared certain financial information of Tivity
Health to corresponding financial information for selected publicly traded companies that, based on Lazard’s
professional judgment and experience, Lazard considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis. The selected
companies used in this analysis were as follows:
Payor Services
•
ModivCare Inc.
•
MultiPlan Corporation
•
Signify Health, Inc.
Tech-Enabled Services
•
Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.
•
Convey Health Solutions Holdings, Inc.
•
Nextgen Healthcare, Inc.
•
Premier, Inc.
•
Sharecare, Inc.
Following the oral submission of Lazard’s opinion, Lazard provided the board on April 7, 2022 with a finalized presentation of its
financial analyses reflecting the finalized share count per the Merger Agreement (the “Finalization”). The Finalization did not
change the conclusion of Lazard’s opinion dated as of April 5, 2022. The impact of the Finalization resulted in a range of implied
value per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $26.95 to $33.90 compared to the prior range of $27.05 to $34.10 for the
discounted cash flow analysis, in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05.

Lazard selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate businesses
similar in certain respects to the business of Tivity Health. However, none of the selected companies is identical to
Tivity Health and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of Tivity
Health. Based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard believes that purely quantitative analyses are not,
in isolation, determinative in the context of the Transaction Consideration and that qualitative judgments concerning
differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of Tivity Health and the
selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each company are also relevant.
For each of the selected companies, Lazard calculated (i) enterprise value (defined as equity market capitalization plus
total debt, plus preferred equity, plus minority interest, less unconsolidated assets, less cash and cash equivalents,
as applicable) based on closing share prices as of April 4, 2022, as a multiple of estimated Adjusted EBITDA (defined
as estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted, as applicable, for non-recurring
items and any other adjustments, as appropriate) for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 and (ii) price per share as of April 4,
2022 as a multiple of Adjusted EPS (defined as diluted income from continuing operations, net of tax, adjusted, as
applicable, for non-recurring items and any other adjustments, as appropriate) for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.

Based on the multiples derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and experience,
Lazard applied a range of multiples of enterprise value / Adjusted EBITDA of 9.0x - 11.0x to Tivity Health’s estimated
Adjusted EBITDA for 2022 and a range of 8.5x - 10.5x to Tivity Health’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA for 2023. Based
on this range of implied enterprise values and Tivity Health’s estimated net debt as of March 31, 2022 (calculated as
total debt less cash and cash equivalents and less the value of Tivity Health’s equity stake in Sharecare, Inc.), this
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $23.75 to $30.15
(rounded to the nearest $0.05) using 2022 Adjusted EBITDA and $25.00 to $32.10 (rounded to the nearest $0.05) using
2023 Adjusted EBITDA, in each case, as compared to the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity
Health Common Stock.2 In addition, based on the multiples derived for the selected companies and based on its
professional judgment and experience, Lazard applied a range of multiples of price / Adjusted EPS of 15.0x - 18.0x and
14.0x - 17.0x to Tivity Health’s estimated Adjusted EPS for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively. This analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $26.65 to $32.00 (rounded to
the nearest $0.05) and $27.50 to $33.40 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), respectively, compared to the Transaction
Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock.
The impact of the Finalization resulted in a range of implied value per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of, $23.75 - $30.15
compared to the prior range of $23.85 - $30.30 for Enterprise Value (“EV”) / 2022 Adjusted EBITDA and $25.00 - $32.10
compared to the prior range of $25.10 - $32.25 for EV / 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05.

Lazard also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to its
opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:
Precedent Transactions Analysis
Lazard reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected transactions
involving target companies in the payor services industry that Lazard believed, based on its experience and
professional judgment, to be relevant in certain respects for purposes of this analysis. None of the selected
precedent transactions or the companies party to such transactions is directly comparable to the Merger or to Tivity
Health, and are included for reference only. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that
could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the Merger. The selected reference transactions in the

For each selected transaction, Lazard calculated the transaction value (defined as the target company’s implied equity
value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus preferred equity, plus
minority interest, less unconsolidated assets, less cash and cash equivalents, as applicable) as a multiple of last
twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA for the target company at the time of the announcement of the applicable
transaction (or in some cases, where last twelve-month financial information was not publicly available, as a multiple
of current calendar year or prior calendar year Adjusted EBITDA), which Lazard refers to as “LTM Adjusted
EBITDA”. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the
time of announcement of each transaction. Lazard analyzed the multiples it derived from the selected payor services
transactions and based on its professional judgment and experience, Lazard selected a reference range of transaction
value to LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 11.5x to 14.2x and applied this range of multiples to Tivity Health’s
estimated LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2022. This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per
share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $30.65 - $38.95 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as compared to the
Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock.3
The impact of the Finalization on the precedent transaction analysis resulted in a range of implied value per share of Tivity Health
Common Stock of $30.65 - $38.95 compared to the prior range of $30.80 - $39.25, in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Illustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis
Lazard performed an illustrative leveraged buyout analysis based on the Tivity Health Projections provided by
management of Tivity Health to determine the range of price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock at which a
financial buyer would be willing to pay to acquire Tivity Health on a stand-alone basis with an illustrative capital
structure that Lazard deemed to be achievable in the current market. For purposes of this analysis, Lazard assumed a
required internal rate of return in the range of 15.0% to 25.0%, total leverage ratio of approximately 6.7x to Tivity
Health’s estimated LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2022 and an exit multiple of 12.0x. This analysis indicated
a range of implied equity values per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $27.05 - $33.65 (rounded to the nearest
$0.05), as compared to the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock. Lazard also
applied these calculations (using a 12.2x exit multiple in lieu of the aforementioned 12.0x exit multiple) utilizing
selected Wall Street equity analysts’ consensus estimates for Tivity Health, extrapolated through 2026 per Tivity
Health guidance, in lieu of the forecasts provided by Tivity Health’s management. This analysis resulted in a range of
implied equity value per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $26.20 to $33.05 (rounded to the nearest $0.05), as
compared to the Transaction Consideration of $32.50 per share of Tivity Health Common Stock.4
Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Lazard reviewed all-cash healthcare services transactions announced since
January 1, 2010 with total enterprise value over $1 billion involving either a U.S. acquiror or a U.S. target and pursuant
to which 100% of the target’s shares were acquired by the acquiror. Using publicly available information, Lazard
calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in
each such transaction exceeded (i) the closing market price per share of the target companies, (ii) the 30-day volume-
weighted average price, (iii) the 60-day volume-weighted average price, (iv) the 90-day volume-weighted average
price and (v) the 52-week high as of the last unaffected date prior to announcement of each transaction.

Common Stock of $27.05 - $33.65 compared to the prior range of $27.10 - $33.75 for the Tivity Health Projections and $26.20 -
$33.05 compared to the prior range of $26.20 - $33.10 for the Wall Street equity analysts’ consensus estimates for Tivity Health,
as extrapolated, in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Lazard applied (i) a one-day
premium range of 17% to 33%, (ii) a 30-Day volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) premium range of 21%-38%,
(iii) a 60-Day VWAP premium range of 21% to 35%, (iv) a 90-Day VWAP premium range of 22% to 39% and (v) a 52-
Week High premium range of (1%) to 20% to the analysis. The one-day premium was applied to (1) the $32.25 closing
price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock as of April 4, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the public
announcement of a proposal from Stone Point Capital to acquire Tivity Health for $32.50 per share, (2) the $27.28
closing price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock as of February 28, 2022, the last full trading day prior to Stone
Point Capital’s outreach to potential debt financing sources, (3) the $24.81 closing price per share of Tivity Health
Common Stock as of January 7, 2022, the last full trading day prior to Lazard’s outreach to other counterparties, and
(4) the $25.36 closing price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock as of December 7, 2021, the last full trading day

premium ranges were applied to Tivity Health’s 30-Day VWAP of $29.76, Tivity Health’s 60-Day VWAP of $28.26, and
Tivity Health’s 90-Day VWAP of $27.46, each calculated as of April 4, 2022. The aforementioned 52-week premium
range was applied to Tivity Health’s 52-week high of $32.61 as of April 4, 2022 and to Tivity Health’s 52-week high of
$28.18 as of February 28, 2022. This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Tivity Health
Common Stock as set forth in the table below (rounded to the nearest $0.05), compared to the Transaction

Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Lazard reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock prepared
and published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of April 4, 2022. The range of selected
equity research analyst price targets per share of Tivity Health Common Stock was $27.00 to $35.00. Public market
trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for
the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock and these target prices and the analysts’ earnings estimates on which they
were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors affecting the financial performance of Tivity Health
and future general industry and market conditions.
Miscellaneous
In connection with Lazard’s services as a financial advisor to the Board, Tivity Health agreed to pay Lazard an
aggregate fee of approximately $24.5 million, $2.5 million of which was payable upon the rendering of Lazard’s opinion
and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, Tivity Health has
agreed to reimburse certain of Lazard’s expenses arising, and to indemnify Lazard against certain liabilities that may
arise, out of Lazard’s engagement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Lazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed
and unlisted securities, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for estate, corporate and other
purposes. In the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard’s opinion, Lazard has provided certain investment
banking services to Tivity Health, for which Lazard received compensation of approximately $9 million, including
having been engaged by Tivity Health to advise on Tivity Health’s disposition of Nutrisystem, Inc. In addition,
Lazard has in the past provided, is currently providing, and may in the future provide certain investment banking
services to Parent and/or certain of its affiliates for which Lazard has received and may receive compensation,
including, during the past two years, having been engaged with respect to certain fund raising matters. The
aggregate amount of fees paid to Lazard for financial advisory services to Stone Point Capital and its known affiliates
in the two-year period prior to the date of Lazard’s opinion was less than $1 million. In addition, in the ordinary
course, Lazard and its affiliates and employees may trade securities of Tivity Health and certain of its affiliates as well
as certain affiliates of Stone Point Capital for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities
on behalf of Tivity Health, Stone Point Capital and certain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of Lazard’s
opinion was approved by the opinion committee of Lazard.
Lazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory and other
services. Lazard was selected to act as investment banker to Tivity Health because of its qualifications, expertise and
reputation in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions generally and in particular, as an advisor to
companies in Tivity Health’s sector, as well as its familiarity with the business of Tivity Health.
Lazard’s engagement and its written opinion are for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) and its written
opinion was rendered to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Lazard’s opinion is not intended
to and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with
respect to the Merger or any matter relating thereto.",43,64

In connection with Tivity Health’s review of strategic alternatives, Tivity Health’s management prepared unaudited
forecasted financial information of Tivity Health for fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2027 and based on such
forecasts prepared extrapolations for the financial projections for 2028 through 2032, which were used by the Board in
connection with its review of strategic alternatives. The Tivity Health Projections were used by Lazard for purposes
of preparing its financial analyses and fairness opinion provided to the Board on April 5, 2022 in connection with its
consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger, as described in the section entitled “Opinion of Tivity
Health’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 46 of this Proxy Statement. In addition, the Tivity Health Projections
were made available to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction, including Stone Point Capital, in
connection with their due diligence review of a potential transaction. The Tivity Health Projections were prepared in
January 2022, treating Tivity Health on a stand-alone basis without giving effect to, and as if Tivity Health never
contemplated, the Merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the Merger Agreement, the expenses that
may be incurred in connection with consummating the Merger, the effect of any business or strategic decision or
action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed or the effect of any
business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been
executed but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger.
The Tivity Health Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and the summary thereof is
included in this Proxy Statement only because such information was made available to the Board in connection with
its review of strategic alternatives, and, in the case of the 2022 through 2027 forecasts, to potential counterparties to a
strategic transaction, including Stone Point Capital, in connection with their due diligence review of a potential
transaction, and to Lazard for purposes of preparing its financial analyses and fairness opinion provided to the Board
on April 5, 2022 in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger, as described in
the section entitled “The Merger-Opinion of Tivity Health’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 46 of this Proxy
Statement. The summary of the Tivity Health Projections is not being included in this Proxy Statement to influence
your decision whether to vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Tivity Health Projections were
not prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines established by the SEC or the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information, or
GAAP (and the Tivity Health Projections do
54TABLE OF CONTENTS
not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP). Neither PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Tivity Health’s
independent registered public accounting firm (“PwC”), nor any other audit firm has audited, reviewed, examined,
compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Tivity Health Projections and, accordingly, PwC
has not expressed an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PwC report included in Tivity
Health’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into
this Proxy Statement, relates to Tivity Health’s historical financial information and does not extend to the Tivity
Health Projections and should not be read to do so.
The Tivity Health Projections are subject to estimates and assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to
interpretation. While presented with numerical specificity, the Tivity Health Projections are based upon a variety of
estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, though considered reasonable by Tivity Health management
as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of
reasons, including general economic conditions, competition and the risks discussed in this Proxy Statement under
the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 25 of this
Proxy Statement. The Tivity Health Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change. There can be no assurance that the projections contained in the Tivity Health Projections will be
realized, and actual results may differ materially from those shown therein. Generally, the further out the period to
which Tivity Health Projections relate, the more unreliable the information becomes.
The information in the Tivity Health Projections is not factual and should not be relied upon as being necessarily
indicative of future results, and Tivity Health’s stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Tivity
Health Projections. The Tivity Health Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical
financial statements and other information regarding Tivity Health contained in Tivity Health’s public filings with the
SEC.
This Proxy Statement contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA (which means
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted, as applicable, for non-recurring items and any
other adjustments, as appropriate) and Unlevered Free Cash Flow (“Unlevered FCF”), which means Adjusted
EBITDA less cash taxes, less capitalized expenditures, less changes in working capital items. Tivity Health believes
that its presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and
management regarding Tivity Health’s financial condition and results of operations. Other firms may calculate non-
GAAP measures differently than Tivity Health, which limits comparability between companies. Non-GAAP measures
are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP.
None of Tivity Health, Lazard or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives can
provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Tivity Health Projections, and none of them
undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Tivity Health Projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the date the Tivity Health Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of
future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Tivity Health Projections, as
applicable, are shown to be in error. Since the date of the Tivity Health Projections, Tivity Health has made publicly
available its actual results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and the quarter ended March 31,
2022. You should review Tivity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with
the SEC on February 25, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2022 for this information. Tivity Health does not intend to
make publicly available any update or other revision to the Tivity Health Projections, even in the event that any or all
assumptions are shown to be in error. None of Tivity Health, Lazard or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers,
directors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any Tivity Health stockholder or any
other person (including Stone Point Capital, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise) regarding the Tivity Health
Projections, Tivity Health’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Tivity Health
Projections or that forecasted results will be achieved.

In considering the recommendation of the Board that holders of Tivity Health Common Stock vote to approve the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, our stockholders should be aware that certain of Tivity Health’s executive
officers and non-employee directors have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those
of Tivity Health’s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other
matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that Tivity Health stockholders
approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement. For purposes of the discussion below, Tivity Health’s executive
officers (each of whom is a named executive officer) are Richard M. Ashworth (Chief Executive Officer), Adam C.
Holland (Chief Financial Officer), Ryan M. Wagers (Chief Accounting Officer), Thomas E. Lewis (Chief Operating
Officer), and J. Raymond Bilbao (Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary) (each, a “NEO”). These interests are
described below.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
The Effective Time is May 18, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for
purposes of the disclosure in this section (the “Change in Control Date”);
•
The employment of each executive officer of Tivity Health is assumed to be terminated by Tivity Health
without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined
in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Change in Control Date;
•
The potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback” to
avoid the “golden parachute” excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”); and
•
A price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $32.50, which is equal to the Transaction Consideration
payable in the Merger.
As the amounts provided below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or
be accurate as of the date referenced, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may materially
differ from the amounts set forth below.
Treatment and Quantification of Tivity Health Equity Awards
Treatment of Company Options
Each Company Option, whether or not vested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and will entitle the holder, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and
(ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company
56TABLE OF CONTENTS
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Transaction Consideration over
the exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If the exercise price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of a Company Option is equal to
or greater than the Transaction Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger
without any action on the part of, and without any payment to, the Company Option holder.
Treatment of Company MSUs
Each Company MSU award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (which, as of the date of this
Proxy Statement, consists only of Company MSU awards held by Mr. Ashworth) will automatically become vested,
will be cancelled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof, and will entitle the holder to
receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving
Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable
withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock that would have vested pursuant to the terms of such Company MSU award based on actual
performance through the Effective Time, and (B) the Transaction Consideration. To the extent that any Company
MSU award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, however, such
cash payment will be paid in accordance with the Company MSU award’s terms and at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code.
Treatment of Company RSUs
Except as described below for Company RSU awards granted after April 5, 2022, each Company RSU award
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically become fully vested, will be cancelled and
will entitle the holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and (ii)
the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest and subject
to applicable withholding taxes) from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the Transaction Consideration. To the extent a Company RSU award constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, however, such cash payment will be paid in accordance with the
Company RSU award’s terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in
the application of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code.
Treatment of Company RSUs Granted After April 5, 2022
If the Merger is completed, except for (i) deferred Company RSUs granted to certain non-employee directors under
Tivity Health’s Director Deferred Compensation Program and (ii) limited exceptions for certain Company RSUs (that
are not applicable to any of Tivity Health’s NEOs or non-employee directors), which, in each case, will vest in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU award granted after April 5, 2022, will vest immediately
prior to the Effective Time on a prorated basis, with such proration based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days of continuous service provided by the grantee to Tivity Health between the grant date of the
Company RSU award and the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is 1,096, and otherwise will be treated in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as described above. The portion of any such Company RSU
award granted after April 5, 2022 that does not vest in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence will be
forfeited without consideration upon the Effective Time without any action on the part of the holder of any such
Company RSU award. No Company RSU awards have been granted to Tivity Health’s named executive officers since
April 5, 2022.
Quantification of Tivity Health Equity Awards
See the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger-
Quantification of Payments and Benefits” beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the
amounts that would become payable to each Tivity Health named executive officer in respect of his unvested
Company Options, Company MSUs and Company RSUs, as applicable.
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Based on the assumptions described above under “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of
Tivity Health in the Merger-Certain Assumptions” beginning on page 56 of this Proxy Statement, the estimated
aggregate amounts that would become payable to Tivity Health’s non-employee directors (including two former non-
employee directors whose service on the Board ended on May 20, 2021) in respect of their unvested Tivity Health
equity awards is $1,277,110 (of which approximately $984,000 pertains to unvested equity awards that are scheduled
to vest on May 20, 2022). Although Peter Hudson, M.D. and Benjamin Kirshner are considered directors for purposes
of this disclosure, both Dr. Hudson and Mr. Kirshner departed the Board on May 20, 2021, do not hold any unvested
Company RSUs and do not otherwise have any interests in the Merger except insofar as they may hold shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock.
Agreements with Tivity Health Named Executive Officers
Messrs. Ashworth and Holland are currently employed pursuant to written employment agreements with Tivity
Health effective on the following dates:
•
Mr. Ashworth - May 20, 2020
•
Mr. Holland - May 22, 2017
Collectively, the employment agreements with Messrs. Ashworth and Holland are referred to as the “NEO
Employment Agreements”. The employment of each of Messrs. Bilbao, Lewis, and Wagers is subject to an offer of
employment letter executed on the following dates (the “NEO Offer Letters”), is not subject to a stated term and
constitutes at-will employment:
•
Mr. Bilbao - October 30, 2020
•
Mr. Lewis - October 4, 2018 (and subsequent amendments dated April 1, 2019 and October 30, 2020)
•
Mr. Wagers - September 14, 2018
In addition to his NEO Offer Letter, Mr. Bilbao is party to a Change of Control Agreement between Tivity Health and
Mr. Bilbao dated as of July 3, 2018 (the “Bilbao Change of Control Agreement”). However, Mr. Bilbao would currently
not receive severance payments under the Bilbao Change of Control Agreement upon a qualifying termination
because Mr. Bilbao would be entitled to receive more favorable severance benefits under the Separation Benefits
Program (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of
Tivity Health in the Merger- Section 16 Officer Separation Benefits Program” beginning on page 59 of this Proxy
Statement).
The NEO Employment Agreements and NEO Offer Letters (other than with respect to Mr. Bilbao) provide that if the
employment of the named executive officer is terminated by Tivity Health without “Cause” or by the named executive
officer for “Good Reason” (each, as defined in the applicable arrangement) within 12 months following a change in
control (which would include the Merger), then the NEO would be entitled to the following payments:
•
Mr. Ashworth - (i) All base salary and benefits due to the NEO through the date of termination, payable in a
lump sum within 30 days of the date of termination; (ii) any earned, but unpaid, bonus, payable in a lump
sum no later than 30 days following the date of termination; (iii) a pro rata portion of any annual bonus for
the year in which the date of termination occurs, based on the greater of target or actual Tivity Health
performance, which pro rata annual bonus amount will be determined after the end of the fiscal year for
which the applicable bonus plan was in place and paid in accordance with the terms of such bonus plan;
(iv) an amount equal to the sum of (a) Mr. Ashworth’s base salary for a total of thirty (30) months following
the date of termination, and (b) Mr. Ashworth’s bonus in respect of the greater of (x) the year prior to the
occurrence of the Effective Date and (y) the year in which the date of termination occurs, payable in a lump
sum no later than 30 days following the date of termination; and (v) an amount equal to Tivity Health’s
estimated obligation for its share of the cost of premiums, and related administrative fees, for group
medical, dental and vision continuation coverage for a period equal to 24 months, payable in a lump sum no
later than 30 days following the date of termination.
•
Mr. Holland - (i) All base salary and benefits due to the NEO through the date of termination, payable in a
lump sum no later than 60 days following the date of termination; (ii) a pro rata portion of any annual bonus
for the year in which the date of termination occurs, based on actual Tivity Health
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
performance, which pro rata annual bonus amount will be determined after the end of the fiscal year for
which the bonus plan was in place and paid in accordance with the terms of such bonus plan; (iii) an
amount equal to Mr. Holland’s base salary for a total of one year following the date of termination, payable
in a lump sum no later than 60 days following the date of termination; and (iv) group medical benefits for
one year after the date of termination, payable in installment payments.
•
Messrs. Lewis and Wagers - (i) All base salary and benefits due to the NEO through the date of
termination, payable in a lump sum within 30 days of the date of termination; (ii) an amount equal to the
NEO’s base salary for a total of one year following the date of termination, payable in installment payments;
and (iii) group medical benefits for one year after the date of termination, payable in installment payments.
In February 2022, Tivity Health entered into a Special Incentive Bonus Award Agreement (the “Special Incentive
Bonus Award Agreement”) with Mr. Ashworth, Tivity Health’s Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which Mr.
Ashworth will be eligible to receive a cash payment in the amount of $5,000,000 (the “Special Incentive Bonus
Award”) on February 11, 2027 (the “Vesting Date”), as long as Mr. Ashworth is serving as an employee of Tivity
Health on the Vesting Date, or on such earlier date as Mr. Ashworth’s employment is terminated by Tivity Health
without “Cause”, Mr. Ashworth resigns for “Good Reason” (each, as defined in the Special Incentive Bonus Award
Agreement), or Mr. Ashworth’s employment terminated due to his death or disability. The Special Incentive Bonus
Award Agreement provides that in the event of a change in control (which would include the Merger), the Special
Incentive Bonus Award will vest as follows: (a) 50% of the Special Incentive Bonus Award will vest immediately on
the date of the change in control, and (b) 50% of the Special Incentive Bonus Award will vest on the first anniversary
of the date of the change in control, provided Mr. Ashworth has remained in the continuous employment of Tivity
Health or its successor through the applicable vesting date (subject to the termination provisions described in the
previous sentence). Mr. Ashworth’s receipt of the Special Incentive Bonus Award is subject to his continued
compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in his NEO Employment Agreement (as described below).
For additional detail, please see the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of
Tivity Health in the Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits” beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement.
Under the NEO Employment Agreements and NEO Offer Letters, each of the named executive officers is subject to
restrictions relating to the use of confidential information, competing against Tivity Health and soliciting any
customers or employees of Tivity Health during the term of employment and for a period up to 24 months thereafter
(in the case of Mr. Ashworth) or 12 months thereafter (in the case of Messrs. Holland, Bilbao, Lewis, and Wagers).
The provision of payments and benefits described above are generally conditioned upon the executive officer’s
execution of a release of claims against Tivity Health.
Section 16 Officer Separation Benefits Program
In September 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted a separation benefits program (the
“Separation Benefits Program”) applicable to Tivity Health’s Section 16 officers, which includes each of its named
executive officers. However, Tivity Health’s Section 16 Officers are not entitled to participate in the Separation
Benefits Program to the extent they are entitled to any severance payments or benefits from another program or
agreement with Tivity Health (for example, an employment agreement or severance agreement) that provides greater
severance payments or more favorable terms than the Separation Benefits Program. Currently, Mr. Bilbao is the only
NEO entitled to participate in the Separation Benefits Program because the Bilbao Change of Control Agreement with
the Company provides for less favorable severance payments than would be payable to him under the Separation
Benefits Program. If the employment of Mr. Bilbao is terminated by Tivity Health without “Cause” or by Mr. Bilbao for
“Good Reason” (each, as defined in the Separation Benefits Program) within 12 months following a change in control,
he would be entitled to the following payments:
•
A severance payment in the form of salary continuation for 52 weeks after the date of termination;
•
Three months of outplacement services; and
•
A subsidy such that Mr. Bilbao’s portion of the COBRA premiums for 52 weeks after the date of termination
will approximate the regular colleague contribution for the coverages elected by Mr. Bilbao.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For additional detail, please see the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of
Tivity Health in the Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits” beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement.
The provision of payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon Mr. Bilbao’s timely execution (without
revocation) of a separation agreement and general release of liability against Tivity Health.
Compensation Arrangements with Parent

discussed or entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to

the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates (including the Surviving

Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the
compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger that will or may become payable to each named
executive officer of Tivity Health in connection with the Merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the
payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and
Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger” beginning on page 56 of this Proxy Statement, which is
incorporated herein.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior to completion of the Merger, including
any equity award grants that may be made after the assumed Effective Time of May 18, 2022. For purposes of
quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
The Effective Time is May 18, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for
purposes of the disclosure in this section;
•
The employment of each executive officer of Tivity Health is assumed to be terminated by Tivity Health
without “Cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “Good Reason” (as such terms are defined
in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the Change in Control Date; and
•
The potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback” to
avoid the “golden parachute” excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code;
•
A price per share of Tivity Health Common Stock of $32.50, which is equal to the Transaction Consideration
payable in the Merger.

Cash. Represents severance payable to each named executive officer upon a termination of employment by Tivity Health
without Cause or by the named executive officer for Good Reason, in each case, pursuant to the NEO Employment Agreements
and NEO Offer Letters or the Separation Benefits Program, as applicable, and consisting of (i) all base salary and benefits due
through the date of termination, which for Messrs. Ashworth, Holland, Lewis and Wagers is payable within 30 days of the date of
termination, (ii) an amount equal to a multiple of monthly salary (30 months in the case of Mr. Ashworth and 12 months in the
case of Messrs. Holland, Bilbao, Lewis, and Wagers), payable in a lump sum (in the case of Mr. Ashworth, no later than 30 days
following the date of termination and in the case of Mr. Holland, no later than 60 days following the date of termination) or in
installment payments (for Messrs. Bilbao, Lewis, and Wagers), (iii) for Mr. Ashworth, any earned, but unpaid, bonus, which is paid
in a lump sum no later than 30 days following the date of termination, which is assumed to be zero for purposes of this disclosure,
(iv) for Mr. Ashworth, a pro rata portion of any annual bonus for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, based on the
greater of target or actual Tivity Health performance, which pro rata annual bonus amount will be determined after the end of
the fiscal year for which the bonus plan was in place and paid in accordance with the terms of such bonus plan, and which is
assuming target levels of performance for purposes of this disclosure, (v) for Mr. Holland, a pro rata portion of any annual bonus
for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, based on actual Tivity Health performance, which pro rata annual bonus
amount will be determined after the end of the fiscal year for which the bonus plan was in place and paid in accordance with the
terms of such bonus plan, and which is assuming target levels of performance for purposes of this disclosure, (vi) for Mr.
Ashworth, an amount equal to the greater of (A) Mr. Ashworth’s annual bonus for the year prior to the occurrence of the
Effective Date and (B) Mr. Ashworth’s annual bonus for the year in which the date of termination occurs, which is paid in the
form of a lump-sum within 30 days of the date of termination, and which is assumed for this purpose to be the same amount as
Mr. Ashworth’s annual bonus for the year 2021, and (vii) for Mr. Ashworth, the full amount of the Special Incentive Bonus
Award in an amount equal to $5,000,000 (under the terms of the Special Incentive Bonus Award Agreement, 50% of the Special
Incentive Bonus Award will vest immediately on the date of the change in control and 50% of the Special Incentive Bonus Award
will vest on the first anniversary of the date of the change in control; any portion of the Special Incentive Bonus Award that
vests must be paid to Mr. Ashworth no later than 15 days following the applicable vesting date; provided, however, that any
unvested portion of the Special Incentive Bonus Award will vest immediately in the event Mr. Ashworth’s employment is
terminated without Cause or for Good Reason). Except with respect to 50% of Mr. Ashworth’s Special Incentive Bonus Award
(i.e., $2,500,000), the amounts payable to each named executive officer under the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (vii)
(i.e., $2,500,000), the amounts payable to each named executive officer under the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (vii)
constitute “double-trigger” payments, which means that the amounts will become payable only on a qualifying termination of
employment within 12 months following the Merger. In the case of 50% of Mr. Ashworth’s Special Incentive Bonus Award (i.e.,
$2,500,000), such amount constitutes a “single-trigger” payment, which means that the amount is payable upon consummation
of the Merger notwithstanding whether Mr. Ashworth incurs a termination of employment. For further details regarding the
amounts that may become payable to Tivity Health’s named executive officers under their arrangements with Tivity Health, see
the sections entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger-Agreements with
Tivity Health Named Executive Officers” and “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the
Merger-Section 16 Officer Separation Benefits Program” beginning on pages 58 and 59 of this Proxy Statement, respectively.

Equity. Represents the value of unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company MSUs held by each named executive
officer. The amounts payable in respect of unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company MSUs at the Effective
Time and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement are “single-trigger” payments, which means that the amounts
will become payable solely as a result of continued employment through the Effective Time. For further information on the

Perquisites / Benefits. Represents Tivity Health’s portion of premiums for group medical benefits to be paid for 12 months
following the NEO’s termination, except that in the case of Mr. Ashworth, this amount represents 24 months of Tivity Health’s
estimated portion of premiums for group medical benefits, payable in a lump sum no later than 30 days following the date of
termination. The continued group medical benefits coverage or cash payment in respect of group medical premiums, as
applicable, is a “double-trigger” payment, which means that the amounts will become payable only on a qualifying termination of
employment within 12 months following the Merger.

The potential payments and benefits described in this table are subject to a “cutback” to avoid the “golden parachute” excise tax
that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. While it is possible that this “cutback” provision may apply to a portion
of the payments that Mr. Ashworth is otherwise entitled to receive, this table assumes that no such “cutback” will apply in order
to present the maximum amount of payments that Mr. Ashworth could receive if the Section 280G provisions were not to apply
to all of Mr. Ashworth’s payments described herein. It is not presently anticipated that the other NEOs would be subject to this
“cutback” provision.

The Company MSUs are calculated based on the trading volume weighted average price of Tivity Health Common Stock over the
period of 20 consecutive trading days ending on May 18, 2022 of $31.98, which results in 345,479 shares being earned compared
to the target shares of 150,000.",66,72

The following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Tivity Health
Common Stock whose shares of Tivity Health Common Stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to
the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations promulgated under
the Code (the “Treasury Regulations”), court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement
63TABLE OF CONTENTS
and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is
limited to holders who hold their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). For purposes of this discussion, a
“holder” means either a U.S. Holder (as defined below) or a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below) or both, as the
context may require.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may
be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances, nor does it address any consequences to holders
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as tax-exempt entities, S corporations,
partnerships (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and
partners therein, financial institutions, insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities who elect to
apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, persons
who are subject to the alternative minimum tax, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States,
persons who actually or constructively own 5% of more of Tivity Health Common Stock, persons who acquire their
shares of Tivity Health Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
compensation, persons who hold their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock as part of a straddle, hedge,
conversion, constructive sale, synthetic security, integrated investment or other risk-reduction transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This discussion does not
address any U.S. federal estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences or any state, local or non-U.S. tax
consequences, or the consequences of the Medicare tax on net investment income. If a partnership (including an
entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status
of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock and
partners therein should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger to their particular
circumstances.
No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
described herein. This summary is not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the tax
consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that they would be sustained by a
court if so challenged.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT
THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING
TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES
ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock who
is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person as defined
in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Tivity Health Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or
loss as a result of such exchange. In general, a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to
the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that the U.S. Holder paid for the
shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain
64
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock is more than one year at the
time of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder are subject to preferential income tax rates.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock who is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment, such as
“controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies.” Non-U.S. Holders should consult their
tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to them in
light of their particular circumstances.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained
by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to a U.S. Holder, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,
such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an
applicable tax treaty); or
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty).
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a
holder of Tivity Health Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a
U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject
to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that provides a
certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or
successor form) or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit
against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the
IRS.
Holders of Tivity Health Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of
the Merger to their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of any state, local, foreign or
other tax laws.

Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act has expired or been terminated. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Time on May 19, 2022.
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the
Merger cannot be consummated until Tivity Health and Parent each file a premerger notification and report form with
the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the
applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be
consummated until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective
HSR Act notification forms, unless extended by a request for additional information or the waiting period is
terminated earlier. Tivity Health made the filings required under the HSR Act on April 19, 2022 and the waiting period
under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 19, 2022.
65TABLE OF CONTENTS
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as either
deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and
notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include
seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private
parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

On May 11, 2022, a purported stockholder of Tivity Health filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Stein v. Tivity Health, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-03832 (referred to as the
“Stein Complaint”), naming as defendants Tivity Health and each member of the Board. On May 20, 2022, a purported
stockholder of Tivity Health filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,
captioned Hopkins v. Tivity Health, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-02992 (referred to as the “Hopkins Complaint”, and,
collectively with the Stein Complaint, the “Complaints”), naming as defendants Tivity Health and each member of the
Board.
The Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Specifically, the Complaints allege that the preliminary
proxy statement filed by Tivity Health with the SEC on May 10, 2022 in connection with the Merger contains
materially incomplete and misleading information concerning the Company’s financial projections and the financial
analyses conducted by Lazard in support of its fairness opinion. The relief sought in the Complaints includes
enjoining the consummation and closing of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly
material information; rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the terms
thereof; granting rescissory damages; directing the defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result
of the defendants’ alleged wrongdoing; and awarding the plaintiffs’ costs and disbursements, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses.
Tivity Health believes that the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit and Tivity Health and the
individual defendants intend to defend against the Complaints; however, Tivity Health cannot predict the amount of
time and expense that will be required to resolve either or both of the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.
Additional lawsuits may be filed against Tivity Health or its directors and officers in connection with the Merger. The
outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or delay
consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Tivity Health, including any costs associated with the
indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no order,
judgment, or injunction, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, by any court or other tribunal of competent
jurisdiction has been entered and continues to be in effect, and no law has been adopted or is effective, in each case
that restrains, enjoins, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff
were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger on the agreed-upon terms,
then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected time frame, or at all.

Outstanding Tivity Health Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that Tivity Health’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be subject to the following treatment as of the Effective Time:
•
Company Options. At the Effective Time, each option granted under Tivity Health’s stock plans to
purchase shares of Tivity Health Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and will entitle the holder to receive, on or before the
later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll
date after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding
taxes, from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the number of shares
of Tivity Health Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Transaction Consideration over the exercise price per share of Tivity
Health Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any
Company Option with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the Transaction Consideration will be
cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on the part of the holder thereof and without any
payment to the holder thereof.

plans that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically become vested and
will be cancelled without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof and will entitle the
holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the Effective Time and (ii) the

product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock that would have vested pursuant to
the terms of such Company MSU award based on actual performance through the Effective Time, and (B)
the Transaction Consideration. To the extent that any Company MSU award constitutes nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, however, such cash payment will be paid in
accordance with the applicable award’s terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such
award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, including
payment in accordance with any applicable exception or permitted payment event under Section 409A of
the Code and Section 1.409A-3(j) of the Treasury Regulations.

April 5, 2022, each Company RSU award, whether or not granted under Tivity Health’s stock plans, that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically become fully vested and will be
cancelled and will entitle the holder to receive, on or before the later of (i) five business days following the
Effective Time and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s first payroll date after the Effective Time, an amount in
cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, from the Surviving Corporation with
respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock then
underlying such Company RSU award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Transaction
Consideration. To the extent that any Company RSU award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, however, such cash payment will be paid in accordance with the
applicable award’s terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result
in the application of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, including payment in accordance
with any applicable exception or permitted payment event under Section 409A of the Code and Section
1.409A-3(j) of the Treasury Regulations.
•
Company RSUs granted after April 5, 2022. At the Effective Time, except for (i) deferred Company RSUs
granted to certain non-employee directors under Tivity Health’s Director Deferred Compensation Program
and (ii) limited exceptions for certain Company RSUs, which, in each case, will vest in full immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each Company RSU award granted after April 5, 2022 will

vest immediately prior to the Effective Time on a prorated basis, with such proration based on a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days of continuous service provided by the grantee to Tivity

which is 1,096, and otherwise be treated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as
described above. The portion of any such equity award granted after April 5, 2022 that does not vest in

"TIVITY HEALTH, INC._20220524_DEFM14A_20120335_4468156.Pdf",Exchange and Payment Procedures,"Exchange and Payment Procedures
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Tivity Health to act
as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Transaction Consideration in the Merger and will enter
into an agreement relating to the Paying Agent’s responsibilities under the Merger Agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Tivity Health. Prior to or concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Transaction Consideration payable in
the Merger to holders of Tivity Health Common Stock (other than shares held in the treasury of Tivity Health and
shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tivity Health, Parent or any of Parent’s wholly-
owned subsidiaries and Dissenting Shares), provided that Tivity Health will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, at the
written request of Parent, deposit with the Paying Agent at the closing of the Merger such portion of the aggregate
Transaction Consideration from Tivity Health’s cash on hand as specified in such request.
Upon surrender of certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares to the Paying Agent together
with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such certificates or book-
entry shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Transaction Consideration. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of Tivity
Health, any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry
share formerly representing such shares of Tivity Health Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the case may be, to
such a transferee if such certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry share is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer or other similar taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the Transaction Consideration payable upon surrender of any certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or book-entry share. Until surrendered as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, each certificate and book-entry
share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Transaction Consideration. Any holder of book-entry shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Transaction Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more book-
entry shares whose shares of Tivity Health Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Transaction
Consideration will upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form or such other
evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, be entitled to receive, and Parent will cause the Paying
Agent to exchange and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Transaction
Consideration in respect of each such share of Tivity Health Common Stock, and the book-entry shares of such
holder will thereupon be cancelled.
Any portion of the payment fund, including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto, that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of certificates and book-entry shares for 12 months after the
Effective Time will be delivered to Parent, upon Parent’s demand, and any holder of certificates or book-entry shares
who has not prior to such date complied with these procedures must thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for satisfaction of its claim for Transaction Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has
been stolen or destroyed. If any certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, the
69TABLE OF CONTENTS
posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably require as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such certificate,
the Paying Agent, or, if subsequent to the termination of the payment fund, Parent, will deliver, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Transaction Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
the exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate been surrendered.
These procedures will be described in the letter of transmittal that you will receive, which you should read carefully in
its entirety.",79,80

Effect;
•
any changes in regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities, credit, financial, debt or other
capital markets conditions, including interest or currency exchange rates, except to the extent that such
changes or conditions have a disproportionate adverse effect on Tivity Health and its subsidiaries, taken

industries in which Tivity Health or any of its subsidiaries operates;
•
any failure, in and of itself, by Tivity Health to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts,
estimates or predictions, or analysts’ estimates, in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics for any period, however, Parent is not precluded from asserting that the facts or
occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the definition
of Company Material Adverse Effect should be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

In the Merger Agreement, Tivity Health agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries and each of its and their
respective directors and officers to, and will instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
subsidiaries’ other representatives to, after April 5, 2022:
•
to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any
persons, other than Parent and its representatives, that are ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover
Proposal (as defined below) or any inquiry, discussion or request that would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Company Takeover Proposal;
•
to promptly (and in any event within two business days following April 5, 2022) request in writing the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any third party or its
representatives;
•
not to, directly or indirectly through intermediaries, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by
way of furnishing non-public information relating to Tivity Health or any of its subsidiaries) the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal;
•
not to, directly or indirectly through intermediaries, conduct, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any information in connection
with, or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging, a Company Takeover Proposal, other than, solely in
response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to the relevant provision of the Merger
Agreement;
75TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
not to, directly or indirectly through intermediaries, execute or enter into any binding letter of intent,

binding or non-binding, with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal (other than an “Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement” as defined in the Merger Agreement);
•
not to, directly or indirectly through intermediaries, grant any waiver, amendment or release (to the extent
not automatically waived, amended or released upon announcement of, or entering into, the Merger
Agreement) of any third party under any standstill or confidentiality agreement; provided that Tivity Health
will be permitted to grant a waiver of any standstill or similar obligation of any third party with respect to
Tivity Health or any of its subsidiaries to allow such third party to make a Company Takeover Proposal.
None of the foregoing will prohibit Tivity Health or its representatives from contacting any person or group of
persons that has made a Company Takeover Proposal after April 5, 2022 solely to ascertain the facts or request the
clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal or to request that any Company
Takeover Proposal made orally be in writing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, if, at any time prior to obtaining the
Tivity Health Stockholder Approval, Tivity Health or any of its representatives receives a bona fide, written Company
Takeover Proposal from any person, which did not result from a material breach of the relevant terms of the Merger
Agreement, and if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Tivity Health, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives may, (i)
furnish information with respect to Tivity Health and its subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company
Takeover Proposal, including non-public information, if Tivity Health receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms that are not materially less restrictive in the aggregate to the other party
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement with Parent; provided, that Tivity Health will promptly, and in
any event within 48 hours following the delivery to such person, make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning Tivity Health or any of its subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
representatives unless such non-public information has been previously provided to Parent and (ii) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal, its
representatives and any prospective debt and equity financing sources regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.
In addition to Tivity Health’s obligations under other provisions of the Merger Agreement, Tivity Health will
promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Parent and Merger Sub if Tivity Health commences furnishing non-
public information or commences discussions or negotiations as provided for in the Merger Agreement.
In addition, Tivity Health agreed:
•
to promptly, and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, notify Parent in writing in the event that Tivity
Health or any of its representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
request that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, including the
identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal or such inquiry, proposal or request and the
material terms and conditions thereof;
•
to keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt),
regarding any material changes to the status and material terms of any such inquiry, proposal or offer,
including, if applicable, by providing Parent with copies of related written documentation; and
•
along with its subsidiaries, not to enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to April 5, 2022
that prohibits Tivity Health from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise
complying with the applicable terms of the Merger Agreement.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement:
•
a “Company Takeover Proposal” is any proposal or offer from any person or group of persons (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) to Tivity Health or any of its representatives relating to (A) a
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, binding share exchange,

a “Company Superior Proposal” is a bona fide, written Company Takeover Proposal (but substituting
“50%” for all references to “20%” in the definition of such term) which did not result from a material breach
of the non-solicitation provision of the Merger Agreement that the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, taking into account the timing, likelihood
of consummation, legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal,
including the financing terms thereof, and such other factors as the Board considers to be appropriate, and
taking into account any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement to which Parent has committed in
writing in response to such Company Takeover Proposal in accordance with the relevant provision of the
Merger Agreement, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and if
consummated would be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Tivity Health
than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.",85,87

Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement, prior to, but not after, obtaining the Tivity Health Stockholder
Approval, the Board may, in respect of a Company Superior Proposal, either or both (1) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (as defined below) or (2) terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive
agreement for such Company Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only if, prior to taking such action, the Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial adviser and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, however, that, prior to taking either such action:
•
Tivity Health has given Parent at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, including the terms and conditions of and the basis for such action, and the identity of the person
making any such Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously provided with such notice to
Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal or any proposed acquisition agreements (or if not
provided in writing to Tivity Health, a written summary of the terms thereof) and a summary of any related
financing commitments in Tivity Health’s possession;
•
to the extent requested in writing by Parent, Tivity Health has negotiated, and has caused its
representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such four business day period concerning
any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent; and
•
following the end of such four business days’ notice period, the Board has determined, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and giving due consideration to the revisions to the
terms of the Merger Agreement to which Parent has committed in writing, that the Company Superior
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal, assuming the revisions
committed to by Parent in writing were to be given effect.
77TABLE OF CONTENTS
Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal requires a new
notice thereof and Tivity Health will be required to comply again with the requirements described in the paragraph
immediately above (except that the four business day period above will be a three business day period).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, neither Tivity Health nor any of its
subsidiaries will enter into any acquisition agreement relating to a Company Superior Proposal unless the Merger
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms and the termination fee (as defined below) has been paid
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board has made the recommendation that
Tivity Health stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Company Board
Recommendation”). The Merger Agreement provides that the Board will not effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (as defined below) except as described below.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Board may not:
•
(i) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this Proxy Statement when it is disseminated to
Tivity Health’s stockholders, (ii) withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw or modify, in any such case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation,
(iii) publicly make any recommendation in support of a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes a
Company Takeover Proposal or fail to recommend against any such tender offer or exchange offer, (iv)
publicly adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, to
stockholders of Tivity Health a Company Takeover Proposal or (v) fail to publicly recommend against any
Company Takeover Proposal or fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case,
within five business days after Parent so requests in writing following a publicly announced Company
Takeover Proposal, provided that Parent may only make such request once with respect to any particular
Company Takeover Proposal or any material publicly announced or disclosed amendment or modification
thereto (any action described in this clause being referred to as a “Company Adverse Recommendation
Change”); or
•
authorize, cause or permit Tivity Health or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any binding letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding or agreement, including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint
venture agreement or other agreement, with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, other than in connection with a Company
Takeover Proposal (as discussed above), the Board may, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Tivity Health
Stockholder Approval, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an event, development or
change in circumstances that was not known to the Board (or if known, the consequences of which were not known
to the Board) as of or prior to April 5, 2022, which event, development or change in circumstances becomes known to
the Board prior to the Stockholder Meeting (an “Intervening Event”), if, prior to taking such action, the Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided,
however, that, prior to taking such action:
•
Tivity Health has given Parent at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, and specifying in reasonable detail the Intervening Event and the potential reasons that the Board
is proposing to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
•
to the extent requested in writing by Parent, Tivity Health has negotiated, and has caused its
representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such four business day period to enable
Parent to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that it would cause the Board to
not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and
•
following the end of such four business days’ period, the Board has considered in good faith any revisions
to the terms of the Merger Agreement to which Parent has committed in writing, and will
78TABLE OF CONTENTS
have determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, assuming the
revisions committed to by Parent in writing were to be given effect, that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law.
The Merger Agreement does not restrict Tivity Health or the Board from complying with its disclosure obligations
under federal or state law with regard to a Company Takeover Proposal, including (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of Tivity Health a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation MA
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the stockholders of
Tivity Health pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in either case, the Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law or obligations of Tivity Health or the Board under applicable federal
securities law.

Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger Agreement, Parent must use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to arrange and obtain and consummate the financing on or prior to the closing date, including, but not
limited to, using its reasonable best efforts with respect to the following items:
•
maintaining in effect the “Equity Commitment Letter” as defined in the Merger Agreement and the “Debt
Commitment Letter” as defined in the Merger Agreement (collectively, the “Commitment Letters”) (subject
to replacement in compliance with the Merger Agreement or as required by the Merger Agreement
following any of the following: (i) the commitments with respect to all or any portion of the Debt Financing
expiring or being terminated, (ii) for any reason, all or any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to fund
the payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at closing (such amount,
the “Required Funding Amount”) becoming unavailable, or (iii) a breach or repudiation by any financing
related person or any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the obligation to fund all or
any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to fund the Required Funding Amount (each, a “Financing
Failure Event”));
•
satisfying on a timely basis all financing conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing of the Merger);
•
negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
that reflect terms no less favorable to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(except to the extent acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion, so long as any new or revised terms would
not be “Prohibited Financing Amendments,” as defined below);
•
in the event that the conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the Merger Agreement
and the financing conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the financing sources to fund the amount of the Debt Financing and the Guarantors to
fund the amount of the Equity Financing necessary to fund the Required Funding Amount; and
•
enforcing Parent’s rights under the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a Financing Failure Event.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, in no event will the reasonable best
efforts of Parent require or be deemed or construed to require Parent to (I) seek equity financing from any source
(other than the Equity Financing), (II) pay any fees materially in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise) or (III) arrange or
obtain any alternative financing having terms and conditions (including any flex provisions applicable thereto) that
are materially less favorable to Parent than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (except to the extent
acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion, so long as any such less favorable terms would not be Prohibited
Financing Amendments as defined below).
Parent will give Tivity Health prompt notice of any breach that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the closing or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter of which Parent or its affiliates becomes
aware. Without limiting Parent’s other obligations under the relevant provisions of the Merger
79TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agreement, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Parent must: (i) promptly notify Tivity Health of such Financing
Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from the
original financing sources or alternative financing sources on terms and conditions that are no less favorable to
Parent than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (except to the extent acceptable to Parent in its sole
discretion, so long as any such less favorable terms would not be Prohibited Financing Amendments as defined
below); provided, that Parent and Merger Sub will not be required to pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any “flex” provisions applicable thereto), and the alternative financing will not
effect any Prohibited Financing Amendments (as defined below), and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
and when obtained, provide Tivity Health with a true and complete copy of, a new financing commitment letter and
related fee letter that provides for such alternative financing. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates will, without the
prior consent of Tivity Health (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend,
modify, supplement, restate, substitute or replace any of the Commitment Letters except for (i) substitutions and
replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and/or (ii)(1) with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letter, any such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, substitution or replacement that would not (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount, taking into account all other sources of
proceeds, necessary to fund the Required Funding Amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions or expand any
of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) materially
delay or prevent the closing or (II) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing on or prior to the closing date less likely to occur, or (C) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter (the limitations set forth in this
clause (1), the “Prohibited Financing Amendments”); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
amend, modify, supplement, restate, substituted or replace the Debt Commitment Letter (x) in accordance with the
“market flex” provisions thereof, and/or (y) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or other
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of April 5, 2022; or (2) with respect to the Equity
Commitment Letter, any such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, substitution or replacement that
would not (A) add new (or otherwise expand, amend or modify any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or
any portion of the Equity Financing, (B) reduce the amount of the Equity Financing below the amount, taking into
account all other sources of proceeds, necessary to fund the Required Funding Amount, (C) adversely affect in any
material respect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, as
so amended, modified, supplemented, restated, substituted or replaced, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against such other parties to the Equity Commitment Letter as in effect on April 5, 2022, or (D) otherwise be
reasonably expected to delay materially or prevent the closing.
Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement, Tivity Health will use its
reasonable best efforts to provide (and will cause each of its subsidiaries and direct its and their respective
representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide) such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent. Such assistance will include using reasonable best efforts to
assist Parent in connection with arranging the Debt Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to do the
following, each of which will be at Parent’s written request with reasonable prior notice and at Parent’s sole cost and
expense: (i) deliver to Parent the Debt Financing Deliverables (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (ii) facilitate and
assist in the preparation and negotiation of the Debt Financing Documents, including one or more credit agreements,
pledge and security agreements, guarantees, certificates (including a solvency certificate), and other definitive
financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including furnishing all (A) information relating to
Tivity Health and its subsidiaries and their respective businesses to be included in any schedules thereto or in any
perfection certificates and (B) stock certificates and any other pledged collateral to the extent held by Tivity Health
and its subsidiaries); (iii) make available to Parent, its advisors and its financing sources such financial and other
pertinent information regarding Tivity Health and each of its subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
its advisors or its financing sources, including (I) the financial statements and other information necessary to satisfy
the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as defined in the Merger Agreement, (II) unaudited financial
statements of Tivity Health for each fiscal quarter of Tivity Health ended 45 days prior to the closing and the audited
financial statements of Tivity Health for any fiscal year of Tivity Health ended 90 days prior to the closing; (III) such
information as is necessary to allow Parent, its advisors and its financing sources to prepare pro forma financial
statements and (IV) customary authorization letters; and (iv) assist with the preparation of lender and investor
presentations,

rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, marketing materials and other similar documents and
materials in connection with the debt financing, participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions (in each case, including via video conference) with providers or
potential providers of the debt financing and ratings agencies and otherwise assist in the marketing efforts of Parent
and its financing sources.
Tivity Health is not, however, required to, among other things, (x) take any such action to the extent it would (1)
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of Tivity Health or require Tivity Health to agree to pay any
fees, reimburse any expenses or give any indemnities, in any case prior to the closing, for which Parent does not
promptly reimburse or indemnify it, as the case may be, under the Merger Agreement, (2) require Tivity Health, or any
of its subsidiaries or their respective representatives to execute, deliver or enter into any Debt Financing Document
prior to the closing and consummation of the Merger, or (3) require Tivity Health to deliver or cause the delivery of
any Debt Financing Document or take any other action prior to the closing and consummation of the Merger that
would reasonably be expected to result in liability to Tivity Health or its representatives in connection with the
financing, (x) require any of the Board (or other similar governing body of any of Tivity Health’s subsidiaries) (other
than persons continuing in such roles after the closing of the Merger) to adopt resolutions approving the Debt
Financing Documents prior to the closing and consummation of the Merger (and any such adoption or approval at
the closing of the Merger will be performed by such Board (or other similar governing body) as constituted after the
Effective Time and closing), and (y) require Tivity Health or any of its subsidiaries to provide any information to the
extent it would (1) violate applicable law or the provisions of any contract not entered into in contemplation of the
Merger Agreement to which Tivity Health or any of its subsidiaries is a party, (2) jeopardize any attorney-client or
other legal privilege or (3) violate any applicable confidentiality obligation of Tivity Health or any of its subsidiaries
not entered into in contemplation of the Merger Agreement so long as Tivity Health provides Parent written notice of
any information so withheld and reasonably cooperates with Parent in seeking to allow disclosure of such
information in a manner that is not reasonably likely to violate such applicable law or contract, jeopardize such
attorney-client or other legal privilege or violate any such confidentiality obligation.
Upon written request from Tivity Health, Parent must keep Tivity Health informed on a reasonably current basis and
in reasonable detail of the status of Parent’s efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub expressly
acknowledge and agree that their obligations under the Merger Agreement, including their obligations to
consummate the Merger, are not subject to, or conditioned on, Parent’s or Merger Sub’s receipt of financing.
Parent agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Tivity Health and its subsidiaries, and each of their respective
representatives, from and against all losses incurred in connection with the Financing or any information, assistance
or activities provided under the Merger Agreement, except to the extent arising from (i) any material inaccuracy of
any historical information furnished in writing by or on behalf of Tivity Health or its subsidiaries, including financial
statements or (ii) the gross negligence, fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct of Tivity Health, any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective representatives. Parent must reimburse Tivity Health and its subsidiaries for any
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses incurred by Tivity Health and its subsidiaries
and each of their representatives in connection with the Financing or such assistance under the Merger Agreement.",89,91

Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the termination date of the applicable Continuing
Employee (as defined below)) (the “Benefits Continuation Period”), the Surviving Corporation will provide, or cause
to be provided, for those employees of Tivity Health and its subsidiaries who continue as employees of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation Period (the “Continuing
Employees”), compensation (including base salary and annual target and maximum bonus opportunities) and
employee benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension, equity or equity-based, nonqualified deferred

that will not be materially less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and employee benefits provided by
Tivity Health or the applicable subsidiary to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,

From and after the Effective Time, Parent must honor, and cause its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its
terms, (i) each employment, change in control, severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement of or

not limited to, those identified in Tivity Health’s disclosure letter and (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective

and the other transactions will constitute a “change in control” (or similar term) of Tivity Health under the terms of
Tivity Health benefit plans containing provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights upon a “change in

against any costs or expenses or other liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or

The Merger Agreement provides that, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any provision of the Merger Agreement
may be amended or waived, but only if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by Tivity Health, Parent and Merger Sub or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving such provision;
provided, however, that in the event that the Merger Agreement has been approved by the stockholders of Tivity
Health in accordance with the DGCL, no amendment will be made to the Merger Agreement that requires the approval
of such stockholders without such approval.
At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, either Tivity Health, on the one hand, or Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, may, to the extent permissible by applicable law and except as otherwise set forth in
the Merger Agreement, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Merger Sub, in the case of an extension by Tivity Health, or of Tivity Health, in the case of an extension by Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained in the Merger Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of any such party contained in the Merger
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party to the Merger Agreement in exercising
any right of amendment, waiver or extension will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right under the Merger Agreement.
In addition, any amendment to certain sections of the Merger Agreement that would affect the rights of a debt
financing source under such section in a manner that is materially adverse to such debt financing source, must also
be approved by such debt financing source.

Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21 thereunder, which were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that Tivity Health provide Tivity Health stockholders
with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the payment of certain compensation that
will or may become payable by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as
disclosed in the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the
Merger- Quantification of Payments and Benefits” beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement.
Tivity Health stockholders are asked to indicate their approval of the compensation that will or may become payable
by Tivity Health to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the
section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger-
Quantification of Payments and Benefits” beginning on page 60 of this Proxy Statement and the accompanying
footnotes. In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be
made have previously formed part of Tivity Health’s overall compensation program for its named executive officers,
and previously have been disclosed to Tivity Health stockholders as part of the “Compensation Discussion and
Analysis” and related sections of Tivity Health’s annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were
adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is composed solely of independent
directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, Tivity Health is seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Tivity Health, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the
compensation that will or may become payable to Tivity Health, Inc.’s named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled “The
Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Tivity Health in the Merger- Quantification of Payments
and Benefits” in Tivity Health’s Proxy Statement for the Special Meeting of stockholders.”
Tivity Health stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to consummation of the Merger, and as
an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Tivity Health, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, regardless of the
outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, Tivity Health’s named executive officers will be eligible
to receive the compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions applicable to those payments.

Tivity Health stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal providing for one or more adjournments of the
Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Board, including to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a
quorum if one is not initially obtained. If this proposal is approved, the Special Meeting could be successively
adjourned to another time and place. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Tivity Health may adjourn, delay or
postpone the Special Meeting (1) with the consent of Parent, (2) if, as of the time the Special Meeting is scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of Tivity Health Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to do business at the Special Meeting, (3) if, as of the time of the Special Meeting is scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of Tivity Health Common Stock with respect to which proxies have been submitted to
approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (4) if the Board determines in its good faith judgment that failure to
adjourn, delay or postpone the Special Meeting would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
or (5) if the Board determines in its good faith judgment that such adjournment, delay or postponement is necessary
for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or additional disclosure reasonably likely to be necessary or
appropriate under applicable law to be disseminated to and reviewed by Tivity Health stockholders prior to the
Special Meeting. If the Special Meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, shareholders
who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. In addition, the
Board may postpone the Special Meeting before it commences in accordance with Tivity’s Health’s bylaws.
The vote on the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary
or appropriate, is a vote separate and apart from the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Tivity Health does not
anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the requisite
number of shares at the Special Meeting.
Vote Required and Board Recommendation
Approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary
or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Tivity Health Common
Stock entitled to vote thereon, which are present or represented by proxy, at the Special Meeting, provided a quorum
is present. The failure of any stockholder of record to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone,
submit a signed proxy card, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate. Abstentions
will be counted as votes “AGAINST” the proposal. Because the proposals presented to stockholders will be
considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will
not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special
Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.
The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the
Special Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement or to seek a quorum if one is
not initially obtained, if a vote on such proposal is called.

If the Merger is consummated, shares of Tivity Health Common Stock held by Tivity Health stockholders who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold of record their shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock through the Effective Time of the Merger, who properly demand appraisal of their shares (and who do
not withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights), and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262
of the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive Transaction Consideration, but the holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex C and
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of
record of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that
holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Tivity Health Common Stock held of record in the
name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to
follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your
shares of Tivity Health Common Stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or the other nominee. Unless context requires otherwise, all
references in this section to a “stockholder” or a “holder” are to a record holder of Tivity Health Common Stock.
Under Section 262, holders of Tivity Health Common Stock who (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of such
holder’s shares of Tivity Health Common Stock to Tivity Health before the taking of the stockholder vote on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
(iii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time, and (iv) otherwise follow the
procedures set forth in Section 262, will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and to
receive in lieu of the Transaction Consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery
to be the “fair value” of the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount determined to
be fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash
payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262). Unless the Court of
Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue
and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period;
provided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving
Corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case, such interest will accrue
after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest
accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders considering seeking
appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more
than, the same as or less than the $32.50 per share Transaction Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger
Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal
rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This Proxy Statement
constitutes Tivity Health’s notice to Tivity Health stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with
the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex C. In connection with the
the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex C. In connection with the
Merger, any holder of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes
to preserve such holder’s right to do so should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the
requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Tivity Health stockholders who assert
appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds one
percent of the outstanding shares of Tivity Health Common Stock measured in
95TABLE OF CONTENTS
accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate Transaction
Consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, Tivity Health believes that if a Tivity
Health stockholder is considering exercising appraisal rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal
counsel. A stockholder who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Transaction
Consideration as described in the Merger Agreement.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Tivity Health Common Stock must
fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Tivity Health a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; and
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the
Effective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the
Effective Time).
If a stockholder submits the form of proxy solicited by Tivity Health, and the stockholder does not provide voting
instructions, the proxy will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should not return a blank
proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.",105,106
"TIVITY HEALTH, INC._20220524_DEFM14A_20120335_4468156.Pdf",Filing Written Demand,"Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Tivity
Health, before the taking of the stockholder vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special
Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not submit a
proxy, or vote by ballot, in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A holder of shares of Tivity Health
Common Stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal
is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. Neither voting (in person or by
proxy) against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the
requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or
vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand before the
taking of the stockholder vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will cause the
stockholder to lose its appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.
Only a holder of record of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock should
be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Tivity Health of the identity of the
holder and state that the stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with
the Merger. If the shares are owned of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depository or
other nominee, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of
record by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by
or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may
execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or
owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or
owners. If a stockholder holds shares of Tivity Health Common Stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares
through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be
made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.

Attention: Secretary
Any holder of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Transaction
Consideration by delivering to Tivity Health a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal within 60 days after the
Effective Time. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time
will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in
the Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of such court and such approval
may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not
affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the Transaction Consideration
within 60 days after the Effective Time.

If the Merger is consummated, within ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of
Tivity Health Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the
Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of
the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or
by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal. The Surviving
Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and holders should not
assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of
shares of Tivity Health Common Stock. Accordingly, any holders of Tivity Health Common Stock who desire to have
their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be responsible for filing a petition for
appraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If no petition is filed with the Court of
Chancery within 120 days after the Effective Time, Tivity Health stockholders’ rights to appraisal will cease, and all
holders of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock will be entitled to receive the Transaction Consideration.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock who has complied with
the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by
a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation
a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the Merger proposal and with respect
to which Tivity Health received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such Tivity Health
Common Stock. The Surviving Corporation must send this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days
after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Tivity Health Common Stock and a copy thereof is
served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such
service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery (the “Register in Chancery”) a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares
97TABLE OF CONTENTS
and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as
required by the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The
Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock
certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any
stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder.",107,108
"TIVITY HEALTH, INC._20220524_DEFM14A_20120335_4468156.Pdf",Determination of Fair Value,"Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Tivity Health Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery will
appraise the “fair value” of the shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of will take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware
stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which
rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,
may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by
the Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to
the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and may not
in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Tivity Health believes that the
Transaction Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a
determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Transaction Consideration. Neither Tivity Health
nor Parent anticipates offering more than the $32.50 per share Transaction Consideration to any Tivity Health
stockholder exercising appraisal rights. Each of Tivity Health and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Tivity Health Common Stock is less than
the $32.50 per share Transaction Consideration.
Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective
Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between
the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the Surviving Corporation may, at any time
before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that
equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as
determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless
paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to
such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and
expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of
Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may
also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata
against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each
party bears its own expense.
98TABLE OF CONTENTS
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Tivity Health Common Stock under Section 262
fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of Tivity
Health Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the Transaction
Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes.
From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Tivity
Health Common Stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except
dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of Tivity Health Common Stock, if any, payable to Tivity
Health stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Tivity Health stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is
encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

Tivity Health does not currently expect to hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2022 (the “2022 Annual
Meeting”) because it will not be a public company after the Merger is completed. However, if the Merger is not
completed, Tivity Health stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in Tivity Health’s annual
meeting of stockholders, and Tivity Health will hold the 2022 Annual Meeting, in which case Tivity Health will
provide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which the 2022 Annual Meeting will be held. If the 2022
Annual Meeting is held, stockholder proposals will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement
and form of proxy for consideration at the 2022 Annual Meeting (“2022 Annual Proxy Statement”) in accordance with
Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and Tivity Health’s bylaws, as described below.
Stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in the 2022 Annual Proxy Statement by submitting their
proposals in writing to Tivity Health in a timely manner. As described in Tivity Health’s annual proxy statement for
the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders filed on April 6, 2021, Tivity Health stockholders had the opportunity to
submit proper proposals for inclusion in the 2022 Annual Proxy Statement and for consideration at the 2022 Annual
Meeting by submitting their proposals to Tivity Health’s Secretary at 701 Cool Springs Blvd., Franklin, Tennessee,
37067 before the close of business on December 7, 2021 and otherwise complying with the requirements of Rule 14a-8
of the Exchange Act. However, if the 2022 Annual Meeting is held and the date of the 2022 Annual Meeting is more
than 30 days after May 20, 2022, then the deadline will be a reasonable time before Tivity Health begins to print and
send its proxy materials for the 2022 Annual Meeting.
Notices of stockholders’ proposals (including nominations) submitted outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 will be
considered timely (but not considered for inclusion in the 2022 Annual Proxy Statement), pursuant to the advance
notice requirement set forth in Tivity Health’s bylaws, if such notices were filed with Tivity Health’s Secretary not
less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting of
stockholders (i.e., not earlier than January 20, 2022 and not later than February 19, 2022). However, in the event that
the 2022 Annual Meeting is held and the date of such meeting is delayed by more than 60 days from May 20, 2022,
notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th
day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), pursuant to

with and into the Company and each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (“Company
Common Stock”) issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), other than shares of
Company Common Stock held by holders who are entitled to and properly demand an appraisal of their shares of
Company Common Stock and shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or owned by
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent, in each case at the Effective Time (such holders, collectively, “Excluded Holders”), will be
converted into the right to receive $32.50 in cash, without interest (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of
the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as of the date hereof as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of

of Company and extrapolations thereto based on the guidance of management of Company and approved for
our use by the Board of Directors of the Company;

and prospects of the Company;

generally relevant in evaluating the business of the Company;

B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
We have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent
verification of such information. We have not conducted any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets
or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or concerning the solvency or fair value of the Company, and
we have not been furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. With respect to the financial forecasts utilized in
our analyses, we have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that they have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of the
Company. We assume no responsibility for and express no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on
which they are based.
Further, our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. We further note that the current volatility and disruption in
the credit and financial markets relating to, among others, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
may have an effect on the Company and we are not expressing an opinion as to the effects of such volatility or such
disruption on the Company. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on
circumstances or events occurring after the date hereof. We do not express any opinion as to the price at which
shares of Company Common Stock may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the Transaction. In
addition, our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any other transaction or
business strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to
engage in the Transaction.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the Transaction will be
consummated on the terms described in the Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or
conditions. Representatives of the Company have advised us, and we have assumed, that the Agreement, when
executed, will conform to the draft reviewed by us in all material respects. We also have assumed, with the consent of
the Company, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the
Transaction will not have an adverse effect on the Company or the Transaction. We do not express any opinion as to
any tax or other consequences that might result from the Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax,
regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed
necessary from qualified professionals. We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than
the Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein) of the Transaction, including, without limitation, the form
or structure of the Transaction or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated
by, the Transaction. In addition, we express no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any
other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Transaction,
or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise.
Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (“Lazard”) is acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction
and will receive a fee for such services, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Transaction. We in the past have provided certain
investment banking services to the Company for which we have received compensation, including, during the past
two years, having been engaged by the Company to advise on the Company’s disposition of Nutrisystem, Inc. In
addition, we have in the past provided, are currently providing, and may in the future provide certain investment
banking services to Parent and/or certain of its affiliates for which we have received and may receive compensation,
including, during the past two years, having been engaged with respect to certain fund raising matters. In addition, in
the ordinary course, Lazard and its affiliates and employees may trade securities of the Company and certain affiliates
of Parent for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities on behalf of the Company, Parent and certain of
their respective affiliates. The issuance of this opinion was approved by the Opinion Committee of Lazard.

capacity as such) and our opinion is rendered to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its

Stock”) or Merger Sub Common Stock:
(i) Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, subject to any applicable withholding
Tax, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically
A-6TABLE OF CONTENTS
converted into the right to receive $32.50 in cash, without interest (the “Transaction Consideration”). From
and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding,
and each applicable holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Transaction Consideration upon the surrender of such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2, into which such shares of Company
Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a).
(ii) Cancellation of Company Common Stock; Certain Subsidiary Owned Shares. At the Effective Time,
each share of Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the Effective Time (x) is held in the
treasury of the Company, or (y) is owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (including Merger Sub), shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (such shares
described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the “Cancelled Shares”), and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.
(iii) Treatment of Merger Sub Shares. At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the “Merger Sub Common Stock”) shall be
automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.
All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Transaction Consideration
pursuant to this ARTICLE II shall no longer be outstanding and upon the conversion thereof shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (“Book-
Entry Shares”) and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Transaction
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate
have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a).
(b) Shares of Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
Person (a “Dissenting Stockholder”) who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Agreement and who has
complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares of Company Common
Stock to demand appraisal of their shares (the “Appraisal Provisions”) of Company Common Stock (“Dissenting
Shares”), to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Transaction Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a)(i), but such holder shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder, whether before, at or after the Effective Time,
effectively withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any
case pursuant to the DGCL, each of such Dissenting Stockholder’s shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be treated as though such shares of Company Common Stock had been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Transaction Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) and such shares shall
not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment to any Dissenting
Stockholder with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, or approve the withdrawal of, any such demands.
(c) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or similar event, or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend
or distribution with a record date during such period, the Transaction Consideration shall be

equitably adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.
Nothing in this Section 2.1(c) shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

(a) Appointment of Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
(which bank or trust company shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as paying agent (the
“Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Transaction Consideration in the Merger and shall enter into an
agreement relating to the Paying Agent’s responsibilities under this Agreement, which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
(b) Deposit of Transaction Consideration. Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, prior to or concurrently with the Effective Time, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Transaction
Consideration payable in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock, other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares (such cash, the “Payment Fund”); provided, that the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, at the written request of Parent, deposit with the Paying Agent at the Closing such portion of
the aggregate Transaction Consideration from the Company Cash on Hand as specified in such request.
(c) Exchange Procedures.
(i) Certificates. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of shares of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall otherwise be in such form and contain such
provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable to the Company) (the “Letter of Transmittal”) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the payment of the
Transaction Consideration payable in the Merger.
(ii) Book Entry Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Evidence

of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Transaction Consideration. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Transaction Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or
more Book-Entry Shares whose Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
Transaction Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form
(or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to exchange and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Transaction Consideration in respect of each such share of Company Common Stock, and the Book-
Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.
(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Transaction Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Transaction
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2(d), without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this ARTICLE II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.
(f) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; provided, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the
time of investment. No such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this ARTICLE II, and following any losses from any such
investment, or to the extent the Payment Fund otherwise diminishes for any reason below the level required for
the Paying Agent to make payments pursuant to this ARTICLE II, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective
Time in the amount of such losses or other shortfall, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Payment Fund. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Payment Fund, and any cash amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 2.1, shall be promptly
returned to Parent.
(g) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest or other amounts
received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon Parent’s demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied
with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for satisfaction of its claim
for Transaction Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE II.

(h) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any portion of the Payment Fund or the Transaction Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such
cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.
(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in form and substance

posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably require
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to Section
2.2(g), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Transaction
Consideration and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement

at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a Tax or

at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code, including payment in accordance with any applicable exception or
permitted payment event under Section 409A of the Code and Section 1.409A-3(j) of the Treasury Regulations.

As of their respective dates or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such

requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and

received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the SEC or its staff. To the Knowledge of the Company,
as of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding

(c) The Company has established and maintains “disclosure controls and procedures” and “internal control
over financial reporting” (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and
Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) substantially as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make
the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company’s
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation. The Company has disclosed based on its most recently completed evaluation of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement to the Company’s
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (i) any “significant deficiencies” and
“material weaknesses” in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The terms “significant deficiencies”
and “material weaknesses” have the meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
(d) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes thereto) of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment filed prior to the date of this
Agreement) (the “Company SEC Financial Statements”) comply in all material respects as to form with applicable

SEC Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of
the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to the absence of information or notes not

Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may, in respect of a Company Superior
Proposal, either or both (1) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) terminate this Agreement

the Company has given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, including the terms and conditions of and the basis for such action, and the identity of the Person
making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously provided with such notice to Parent
a copy of the Company Superior Proposal or any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements (or if not
provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the terms thereof) and a summary of any related
financing commitments in the Company’s possession, (x) to the extent requested in writing by Parent, the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such four (4) Business Day period concerning any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent,
and (y) following the end of such four (4) Business Days’ notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall
have determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and giving due
consideration to the revisions to the terms of this Agreement to which Parent has committed in writing, that the
Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal (assuming
the revisions committed to by Parent in writing were to be given effect), and (z) in the event of any change to
any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other
material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (w) above of this proviso and a new notice period
under clause (w) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four (4) Business Day notice period referred to
above shall instead be equal to three (3) Business Days) during which time the Company shall be required to
comply with the requirements of this Section 5.5(e) anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (w) through (z) above of this proviso. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms and the Termination Fee has been paid in the
manner provided in Section 7.3.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, other than in connection with a
Company Takeover Proposal, the Company Board of Directors may, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided,
however, that, prior to taking such action, (i) the Company has given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and specifying in reasonable detail the Intervening Event
and the potential reasons that the Company Board of Directors is proposing to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, (ii) to the extent requested in writing by Parent, the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such four (4) Business Day period to
enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause the Company Board
of Directors to not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (iii) following the end of such
four (4) Business Days period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement to which Parent has committed in writing, and shall have determined,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel (assuming the revisions committed to by
Parent in writing were to be given effect), that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the termination date of the applicable
Continuing Employee) (the “Benefits Continuation Period”), the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause
to be provided, for those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue as employees of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation Period (the
“Continuing Employees”), compensation (including base salary and annual target and maximum bonus
opportunities) and employee benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension, equity or equity-based,
nonqualified deferred compensation, or post-termination or retiree health or welfare benefits) with respect to
each Continuing Employee that shall not be materially less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation
and employee benefits provided by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the same exclusions). Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a
guarantee of employment for any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other
than as provided in any applicable employment agreement or other Contract, to restrict the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any such employee.
(b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any applicable pre-existing condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or
successor welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates in which a Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods
were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated, (ii) provide, or
cause to be provided, each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to
the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, and (iii) recognize, or
cause to be recognized, service prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting (for the avoidance of doubt, other than with respect to Company
Stock Awards), determination of level of benefits and benefits accrual to the same extent such service was
recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with its terms, (i) each employment, change in control, severance and termination protection plan,
policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former officer,
director or employee, including, but not limited to, those identified in Section 5.6(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge that the consummation of Merger and the other Transactions will constitute a
“change in control” (or similar term) of the Company under the terms of the Company Benefit Plans containing
provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights upon a “change in control” or similar transaction.
(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending ninety (90) days thereafter, not to effectuate a “plant closing” or “mass layoff” as
those terms are defined in WARN affecting in whole or in part any site of employment, facility, or operating unit
of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of
its Subsidiaries not to take any such action after such ninety (90) day period without complying in all material
respects with WARN.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide Continuing Employees whose employment terminates during the Benefits
Continuation Period with severance benefits no less favorable than the severance benefits that
A-35TABLE OF CONTENTS
would have been provided in accordance with the Company’s past practices or any severance plans, policies or
commitments applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, to the
extent set forth on Section 5.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or
other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person
in respect of continued employment by the Company, Parent, any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise, or
(iii) subject to the requirements of this Section 5.6, shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the Closing

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, as promptly as practicable, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the Merger as promptly as practicable, including to use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly
as practicable, (i) cause all of the conditions to Closing set out in ARTICLE VI to be satisfied, (ii) prepare and file
all filings and submissions under the HSR Act, (iii) obtain the expiration or termination of any waiting periods
under the HSR Act, and (iv) obtain all necessary material consents or waivers from non-Governmental Entity
third parties (provided, that in no event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to pay or to commit
to pay to any Person whose consent or waiver is being sought any cash or other consideration, or make any
accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person in connection with such
consent or waiver). In furtherance and not in limitation thereof, not later than ten (10) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall each make an appropriate filing of a notification and
report form pursuant to the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions. Parent and the
Company shall promptly notify the other Party of any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Entity received by such Party alleging that such Governmental Entity’s consent is or may be required in
connection with or as a condition to the consummation of the Merger or any other Transaction.
(b) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other
Party in the taking of the actions contemplated by Section 5.7(a), (ii) provide such assistance as the other Party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing, including supplying the other Party with any
information (except for any notification and report form filed pursuant to the HSR Act) that the other Party may
reasonably request in order to effectuate the taking of such actions, and (iii) keep the other Party reasonably
and timely informed of any developments, meetings, or discussions with any Governmental Entity under any
Antitrust Laws, and any inquiries or requests for additional information, from any Governmental Entity under
any Antitrust Laws. If the Company or Parent receives a formal or informal request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger or the
other Transactions, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. In addition, to the extent practicable, none of the Parties hereto shall participate in any
substantive meeting or conference (telephone, video, in-person or otherwise) with any Governmental Entity, or
any member of the staff of any Governmental Entity, in respect of any filing, Action, investigation (including any
settlement of the investigation) or other inquiry under any Antitrust Laws unless it provides reasonable prior
notice of such meeting or conference and consults with the other Party in advance and, where permitted by
such Governmental Entity, allows the other Party to participate. To the extent reasonably practicable, legal
counsel for Parent and for the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and will consult with the other
Party on and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with any substantive filing made
with, or substantive written materials submitted to, any third party or Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger and the other Transactions. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. However, (A) each of Parent and the Company may designate any
information or material shared under this Section 5.7 as restricted to “Outside Counsel Only” and any such
A-36TABLE OF CONTENTS
information or material shall not be shared with employees, officers, managers or directors or their equivalents of
the other Party without approval of the disclosing Party, and (B) materials may be redacted (x) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements
or applicable Law, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege concerns.
Neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to comply with any of the foregoing provisions of this Section
5.7(b) to the extent that such compliance would be prohibited by applicable Law. The Company shall not
voluntarily extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or associated with any consent of any Governmental
Entity or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of Parent. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent
shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any requisite
regulatory approvals and be entitled to direct, control and lead communications, discussions, and negotiations
under this Section 5.7, and the Company will cooperate reasonably, subject to applicable Law, therewith;
provided, however, that Parent shall consult in advance (to the extent reasonably practicable) with the Company,
and give due consideration in good faith to the Company’s views regarding such strategy, communications,
discussions, and negotiations.
(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions in this Section 5.7, Parent and Merger Sub agree
to take, and to cause their respective controlled Affiliates to take, in each case as promptly as practicable (and in
any event prior to the End Date), any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity and obtain all clearances,
consents, approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental Entity
(including complying with all restrictions and conditions, if any, imposed or requested by any Governmental
Entity in connection with granting any necessary consent, approval, Order, actions or nonactions, waiver or
clearance, or terminating any applicable waiting period), so as to enable the Parties to close the Merger and the
other Transactions as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date), including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, (i) the
sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any Subsidiaries, operations, divisions, businesses, product
lines, customers or assets of Parent or any of its controlled Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), (ii) any limitation or modification of any of the businesses, services,
products or operations of Parent or any of its controlled Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), (iii) the termination, relinquishment, modification, or waiver of existing
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or any of its controlled
Affiliates (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), and/or (iv) the creation of
any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or any of its
controlled Affiliates (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time) (each, a
“Remedial Action”); provided, however, that Parent will not be required to take any Remedial Action that is not
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, in furtherance and not in limitation of the other
provisions in this Section 5.7, Parent shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, take all actions (A)
necessary to defend, including through pursuing litigation on the merits, any administrative or judicial action or
Proceeding asserted or threatened by any Governmental Entity or any other Person under Antitrust Laws
(including pursuing all available avenues of administrative and/or judicial appeal) that seeks, or would
reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, restrain, impede, delay, enjoin, or otherwise prohibit the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and (B) necessary in order to avoid entry of, or to
have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) entered, issued or
threatened that would prevent, restrain, impede, delay, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other Transactions prior to the End Date or otherwise materially delaying the Closing or
delaying the Effective Time beyond the End Date; provided, however, that the obligations set forth in this
sentence shall not limit the obligation of Parent to take, and/or to cause its controlled Affiliates to take, any
Remedial Action or to otherwise comply with its obligations set forth in this Section 5.7(c). The entry by any
Governmental Entity of an Order requiring any Remedial Action shall not be deemed to constitute or result in a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or a failure of any condition to the
Transactions to be satisfied.
(d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree
to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or divisions thereof (through acquisition, license,

combination statute or regulation” or other similar state anti-takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may

former director and officer of the Company as of the Effective Time and any of its Subsidiaries and any other
Person entitled to indemnification under the Company Organizational Documents or Organizational Documents

investigative, arising out of or related to the fact that such Person is or was a Company Indemnified Party and
pertaining to matters existing or occurring or actions or omissions taken at or prior to the Effective Time,
including (i) the Transactions, and (ii) actions to enforce this Section 5.10 and any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Company Indemnified Party, and Parent shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, also advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law; provided, that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by a final and nonappealable judicial determination that such Company Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification.
(b) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Company

shall survive the Transactions and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Company Indemnified Parties.
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may and, if the Company does not, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly following the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for the
extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’
insurance policies for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier
with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”)
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable to the Company Indemnified
Parties than the Company’s existing policies. If neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation obtains such
a “tail” insurance policy as of the Effective Time, then, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the D&O Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable to the Company Indemnified
Parties than those provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof (provided, that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of similar
national reputation that have at least the same coverage and amounts as the D&O Insurance in place on the
date hereof and containing terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability which are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company Indemnified Parties than those of the D&O Insurance in place on the date hereof)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events, or actions or omissions, which occurred or are alleged to
have occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the
premiums paid in 2021 by the Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation’s good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

in limitation of, any other rights such Company Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational

or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.10.
(f) The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of,

following items: (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters (subject to replacement in compliance with this
Agreement or as required by Section 5.20 following a Financing Failure Event); (ii) satisfying on a timely basis
all Financing Conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub (other than those conditions that by their nature

A-42TABLE OF CONTENTS
waiver of such conditions at the Closing); (iii) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents
that reflect terms no less favorable to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (except to
the extent acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion, so long as any new or revised terms would not be
Prohibited Financing Amendments); (iv) in the event that the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2
and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the amount of the Debt Financing and the Guarantors to fund the
amount of the Equity Financing necessary to fund the Required Funding Amount; and (v) enforcing Parent’s
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a Financing Failure Event. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent require or be
deemed or construed to require Parent to (I) seek equity financing from any source (other than the Equity
Financing), (II) pay any fees materially in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (whether
to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise) or (III) arrange or obtain any Alternative
Financing having terms and conditions (including any flex provisions applicable thereto) that are materially less
favorable to Parent than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (except to the extent acceptable to Parent
in its sole discretion, so long as any such less favorable terms would not be Prohibited Financing Amendments).
(b) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any breach that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the Closing or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter of which Parent or
its Affiliates becomes aware. Without limiting Parent’s other obligations under this Section 5.20, if a Financing
Failure Event occurs, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the
reasons therefor, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing (“Alternative Financing”)
from the original Financing Sources or alternative Financing Sources on terms and conditions that are no less
favorable to Parent than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (except to the extent acceptable to Parent
in its sole discretion, so long as any such less favorable terms would not be Prohibited Financing
Amendments); provided, that the Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to pay any fees in excess of
those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any “flex” provisions applicable thereto), and the
Alternative Financing shall not effect any Prohibited Financing Amendments, and (iii) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a true and complete copy of, a new financing
commitment letter and related fee letter that provides for such Alternative Financing (with any such Alternative
Financing being deemed to constitute “Debt Financing”, the commitment letter and fee letter with respect
thereto (which fee letter may be redacted in the manner contemplated by Section 4.11) being deemed to
constitute a “Debt Commitment Letter” and the definitive documentation with respect thereto being deemed to
constitute the “Debt Financing Documents”). Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall, without the prior
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend,
modify, supplement, restate, substitute or replace any of the Commitment Letters except for (i) substitutions and
replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and/or (ii)(1) with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letter, any such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, substitution or replacement that would not
(A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount, taking into account all other sources
of proceeds, necessary to fund the Required Funding Amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions or
expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (I) materially delay or prevent the Closing or (II) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing Date less likely to
occur, or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to the Debt
Commitment Letter (the limitations set forth in this clause (1), the “Prohibited Financing Amendments”);
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may amend, modify, supplement, restate, substituted or
replace the Debt Commitment Letter (x) in accordance with the “market flex” provisions thereof, and/or (y) to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or other entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement; or (2) with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter, any
such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, substitution or replacement would not (A) add new (or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the
Equity Financing, (B) reduce the amount of the Equity Financing below the amount, taking into account all other

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.1(h), the
Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by
Parent) in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days after such termination.
(iii) If (A) a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed by any Person after the date

Section 7.1(c) and at the time of such termination the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) and Section
6.1(c) have been satisfied, (y) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or (z) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and (B) at any time on or prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of such
termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any
transaction included within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal that is subsequently
consummated (whether within such twelve (12) month period or thereafter), then the Company shall pay
Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) of immediately
available funds upon the consummation of such transaction; provided, that for the purposes of this
Section 7.3(a)(iii), all references in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal to “twenty percent (20%)”
shall instead be references to “fifty percent (50%).”
(b) “Company Termination Fee” shall mean a cash amount equal to $54,371,114.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that if this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with any provision under which payment of the Company Termination Fee is required
hereunder or is terminated at a time at which this Agreement is then terminable under any provision that would
trigger the Company’s obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee, then, except in the case of Fraud or a
Willful and Material Breach occurring prior to such termination, upon receipt of such payment by Parent, (i) the
payment of such Company Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 7.3, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement
in this Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and (ii) none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives (collectively, the “Company Parties”) shall have any further liability of any kind
for any reason arising out of or in connection with the Transactions. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub
receives any payments from the Company in respect of a breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent is
entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee under this Section 7.3, the amount of such Company
Termination Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company to Parent or
Merger Sub. In no event shall Parent be entitled to more than one payment of the full Company Termination Fee
in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which such Company Termination Fee is
payable.
(d) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in
which such Company Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve Fraud or a Willful and
Material Breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any
amount due pursuant to Section 7.3(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences
a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3 or any portion
thereof, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection under

adequate remedy for any such damages. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it, including monetary damages (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.4), each of the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of

shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law or
that the award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties

The name of the corporation is Tivity Health, Inc. (hereinafter called the “Corporation”).

The address of the Corporation’s registered office in the State of Delaware is 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, New
Castle County, Delaware 19808. The name of its registered agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.
ARTICLE THREE
The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized
under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
ARTICLE FOUR
The total number of shares which the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is one hundred (100) shares, all of
which shall be shares of Common Stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share.
ARTICLE FIVE
The directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws, except as may be otherwise be provided in the
Bylaws.
ARTICLE SIX
The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.
ARTICLE SEVEN
Section 1. Nature of Indemnity. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a
“proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he (or a person of whom he is the legal representative), is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity
as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent which it
is empowered to do so by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to
such amendment) against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees actually and reasonably incurred by
such person in connection with such proceeding and such indemnification shall inure to the benefit of his or her
heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article Seven, the
Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding initiated by
such person only if such proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Article Seven shall be a contract right and, subject to Sections 2 and 5 of this Article
Seven, shall include the
A-68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
right to payment by the Corporation of the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its
final disposition. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and
agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.
Section 2. Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Any indemnification of a director or officer of the
Corporation under Section 1 of this Article Seven or advance of expenses under Section 5 of this Article Seven shall
be made promptly, and in any event within 30 days, upon the written request of the director or officer. If a
determination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
Seven is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for indemnity, the
Corporation shall be deemed to have approved the request. If the Corporation denies a written request for
indemnification or advancing of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not
made within 30 days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article Seven shall be enforceable
by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person’s costs and expenses incurred in
connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall
also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to
enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of
conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct,
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.
Section 3. Nonexclusively of Article Seven. The rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article Seven shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of
incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Section 4. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this
Article Seven.
Section 5. Expenses. Expenses incurred by any person described in Section 1 of this Article Seven in defending a
proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of such proceeding’s final disposition unless otherwise
determined by the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Corporation. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and
conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
Section 6. Employees and Agents. Persons who are not covered by the foregoing provisions of this Article Seven
and who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the
Corporation as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may
be indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Section 7. Contract Rights. The provisions of this Article Seven shall be deemed to be a contract right between the
Corporation and each director or officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while this Article Seven and the
relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or other applicable law are in effect, and
any repeal or modification of this Article Seven or any such law shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing
with respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 8. Merger or Consolidation. For purposes of this Article Seven, references to “the Corporation” shall
include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had
power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article Seven with respect to the resulting or
surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence
had continued.
ARTICLE EIGHT
The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provisions contained in this Certificate of Incorporation
from time to time and at any time in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and
all rights conferred upon stockholders and directors are granted subject to such reservation.

require.
ARTICLE II
 
MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS
Section 1. Place and Time of Meetings. An annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held each year for the
purpose of electing directors and conducting such other proper business as may come before the meeting. The date,
time and place of the annual meeting shall be determined by resolution of the board of directors. Only stockholders
entitled to vote at an annual meeting shall have the right to attend such annual meeting.
Section 2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders may be called for any purpose (including, without
limitation, the filling of board of directors vacancies and newly created directorships), and may be held at such time
and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in a notice of meeting or in a duly executed
waiver of notice thereof. Such meetings may be called at any time by a majority of the members of the board of
directors, or upon the written request to the corporation of holders of shares entitled to cast not less than fifty
percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of the corporation’s voting stock. Only stockholders entitled to vote at a
special meeting shall have the right to attend such special meeting.
Section 3. Place of Meetings. The board of directors may designate any place, either within or without the State of
Delaware, as the place of meeting for any annual meeting or for any special meeting called by the board of directors.
If no designation is made, or if a special meeting be otherwise called, the meeting shall be held telephonically or at the
principal executive office of the corporation.
Section 4. Notice. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take action at a meeting, written or printed
notice stating the place, date, time, and, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes, of such meeting,
shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the
date of the meeting. All such notices shall be delivered, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the
board of directors, the chief executive officer or the secretary, and if mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be
delivered when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his, her or its
address as the same appears on the records of the corporation. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends for the express purpose of objecting at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to
stockholders given by the corporation shall be effective if given by a
A-72
TABLE OF CONTENTS
form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall
be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if
(1) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation
in accordance with such consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of
the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided that the
inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given
by a form of electronic transmission shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a
number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic
network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting
and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to
the stockholder. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the
corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of this Section 4, “electronic transmission” means any
form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper that creates a record that may be
retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a
recipient through an automated process.
Section 5. Stockholders List. The officer having charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall make, at least ten
days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting
arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the
name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to
the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place
within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting or, if not so
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place
of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
Section 6. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law or by the corporation’s certificate of
incorporation, a majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares is
represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time in
accordance with Section 7 of this Article II, until a quorum shall be present or represented.
Section 7. Adjourned Meetings. When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote
at the meeting.
Section 8. Vote Required. When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person
or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders,
unless the question is one upon which by express provisions of an applicable law or of the corporation’s certificate
of incorporation a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the
decision of such question. Where a separate vote by class is required, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares
of such class present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class, unless the
question is one upon which by express provisions of an applicable law or of the corporation’s certificate of
incorporation a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision
of such question.
Section 9. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or
by the corporation’s certificate of incorporation and subject to Section 3 of Article VI hereof, every stockholder shall
at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of stock entitled to
vote held by such stockholder.
A-73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 10. Proxies. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him, her or it by
proxy. Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder granting the proxy or by his, her or its attorney-in-fact. No
proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A
duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether
the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.
Section 11. Action by Written Consent. Unless otherwise provided in the corporation’s certificate of incorporation,
any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action
which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken and bearing the
dates of signature of the stockholders who signed the consent or consents, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than a majority of the shares entitled to vote, or, if greater, not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered
office in the state of Delaware, or the corporation’s principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the
corporation having custody of the book or books in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the corporation’s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested; provided that no consent or consents delivered by certified or registered mail shall be deemed delivered
until such consent or consents are actually received at the registered office. All consents properly delivered in
accordance with this section shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective
to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the
corporation as required by this section, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to
take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Any
action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect
as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof.
Section 12. Ratification of Acts of Directors and Officers. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Corporation, any transaction or contract or act of the Corporation or of the directors or the
officers of the Corporation may be ratified by the affirmative vote of the holders of the number of shares which would
have been necessary to approve such transaction, contract or act at a meeting of stockholders, or by the written
consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting.

board of directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock
shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such
certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of

so authorize, the signature of such chairman of the board of directors, president, vice president, treasurer, secretary,
assistant treasurer or assistant secretary may be facsimiles thereof. In case any officer or officers of the Corporation
who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any such certificate shall

Section 2. Stock Ledger. A record shall be kept by the secretary, transfer agent or by any other officer, employee or
agent designated by the board of directors of the name of the person, firm or corporation holding the stock

appointed as provided in Section 6 of this Article V, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares
properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon. The person in whose name shares of stock stand on the

the Corporation a bond in such sum and in such form as it may direct or to otherwise indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft, mutilation or destruction of any
such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate. Proper evidence of such loss, theft, mutilation or destruction

of stockholders (and in such case not less than 10 days before the date of such meeting), or the date for the payment
of any dividend or distribution, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any exercise of any rights,
change or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect or a date in connection with obtaining any
written consent to corporate action without a meeting (and in such case not more than 10 days after the date on
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors), as a record date for the
determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, such meeting, and any adjournment thereof, or
to receive payment of any dividend or distribution, or to receive any such allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights
in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of capital stock or to give such written consent, as the case

without a meeting when no prior action of the board of directors is required by law, shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the board of directors is required by law,
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such
prior action; and
(c) the record date for determining stockholders for any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect to any change, conversion or exchange of
stock, or any other purpose, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts
the resolution relating thereto.

with any provision of the corporation’s certificate of incorporation, the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware or any other applicable law the provisions of these bylaws shall not be given any effect to the extent of
such inconsistency but shall otherwise be given full force and effect.
