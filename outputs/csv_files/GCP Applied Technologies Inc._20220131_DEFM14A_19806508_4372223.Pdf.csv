Date, Time and Place
A special meeting of our stockholders will be held on March 8, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to

Table of Contents
Purpose
At the special meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on the following proposals:
(i)
to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “Merger Proposal”);
(ii)
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”); and
(iii)
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers
in connection with the Merger (the “Compensation Proposal”).
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 73,935,805 shares of GCP common stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the special meeting. A quorum of
stockholders is necessary to conduct business at a special meeting. The holders of a majority of the shares of outstanding GCP common stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. As a
result, 36,967,903 shares of GCP common stock must be represented by proxy or by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
to have a quorum. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the special meeting may result in an adjournment of the special meeting and may subject
us to additional expense.
Required Vote
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of GCP common stock outstanding as of the
Record Date and entitled to vote on the matter. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Approval of the Compensation
Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and
entitled to vote on the matter.
Stock Ownership and Interests of Certain Persons
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an aggregate of 419,806 shares of GCP
common stock (excluding any shares that would be delivered upon exercise or conversion, as applicable, of GCP stock options or GCP restricted
stock units and excluding shares beneficially owned by Starboard Value LP and certain of its affiliates (“Starboard”)), representing approximately
0.6% of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of
their shares of GCP common stock: (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Compensation
Proposal.
As of the Record Date, Starboard and certain affiliates of Standard Investments (formerly known as 40 North) and Standard Industries (collectively,
“Standard”) beneficially owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of 6,540,000 and 17,778,352 shares of GCP common stock, respectively,
representing approximately 8.8% and 24.0% of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock, respectively. Per the voting agreements entered into
between Starboard and Standard, respectively, and Parent, Merger Sub and the persons named therein, Starboard and Standard have agreed to vote:
(i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; and (ii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

Voting of Proxies
Any GCP stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by Internet, telephone or
mail or may attend the special meeting and vote in person. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of GCP common stock in “street name”
through a broker, bank or nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of GCP common stock
using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks or nominees have the
discretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to
such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and brokers, banks and nominees therefore cannot vote on these
proposals without your instructions. Generally, if a broker exercises its discretion on routine matters at a stockholder meeting, a stockholder’s shares
will be voted on the routine matter in the manner directed by the broker, but will constitute a “broker non-vote” on all of the non-routine matters to
be presented at the stockholder meeting. Because all of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are non-routine matters, if you hold your
shares in street name through a brokerage account, your broker will not be able to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on any of the
proposals presented at the special meeting. As a result, we do not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. Therefore, it is important that
you instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of GCP common stock or that you obtain from such broker, bank or
nominee a valid legal proxy issued in your name and vote in person at the special meeting.
If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by signing
another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us before 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day before the special meeting, by providing written
notice of revocation to our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary before your proxy is exercised, by submitting a new proxy card
electronically over the Internet or telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy or by attending the special meeting and voting in person.
See the instructions set forth in “Revocability of Proxies” on page 26 of this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of common stock in “street
name,” you should contact your broker, bank or nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote.
The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card or to vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote on the Merger
Proposal, your proxy will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal, but assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation
Proposal. Because all of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are non-routine matters, if you hold your shares in street name through
a brokerage account, your broker will not be able to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on any of the proposals presented at the
special meeting and, as a result, we do not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal.
Neither the SEC nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved of the transactions described in this proxy statement,
including the Merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of such transactions, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this
proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
Expenses of Proxy Solicitation (page 27)
Our board of directors (the “Board”) is soliciting your proxy, and GCP will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. We have engaged the services of Okapi
Partners LLC (“Okapi”) to solicit proxies for the special meeting. In connection with its retention, Okapi has agreed to provide consulting, analytic
and proxy solicitation
4
Table of Contents
services in connection with the special meeting. We have agreed to pay Okapi a fee of approximately $21,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, for its services, and we will indemnify Okapi for certain losses arising out of its proxy solicitation services. In addition to the solicitation of
proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, or representatives of Okapi, in person or by telephone, email, fax
or other means of communication, and we may pay persons holding shares of GCP common stock on behalf of others their expenses for sending
proxy materials to their principals. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or employees for their services in connection
with solicitation of proxies.
Certain Effects of the Merger on GCP (page 33)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into GCP, with GCP continuing as the
surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”) and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, GCP will cease to be a
publicly traded company and will cease to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). If the Merger is completed, you will not own any
shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, and instead will only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in “The
Merger—Merger Consideration” on page 34 of this proxy statement (except that if you are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal for
your shares in accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as
amended (the “DGCL”), you will be entitled only to those rights granted under Section 262 of the DGCL as described in “The Merger—Appraisal
Rights” on page 69 of this proxy statement and Appendix B to this proxy statement).
The effective time of the Merger will occur upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such
later time as we and Parent may agree and specify in the certificate of merger) (the “Effective Time”).
Effect on GCP if the Merger is Not Completed (page 33)
If the Merger Proposal is not approved by the stockholders of GCP or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any
payment for your shares of GCP common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, GCP common stock will continue to be listed and traded on
the NYSE and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and we will continue to be obligated to file
periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a
termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” on page 104 of this
proxy statement.
Merger Consideration (page 34)
At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of GCP common stock (other than (i) shares held by GCP as treasury stock or held by Parent or Merger
Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of GCP, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) shares of common stock held by stockholders who are entitled to and
have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (“Dissenting
Shares”)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $32.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the
“Merger Consideration”). All shares of GCP common stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically be
cancelled and cease to exist at the Effective Time, and each certificate formerly representing such shares will thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. Following the completion of the Merger, GCP will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
As described further in “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures” on page 85 of this proxy statement, substantially currently
with the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited with the paying agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration. Following the completion of
5
Table of Contents
the Merger, after a stockholder has provided the paying agent with such stockholder’s stock certificates and a letter of transmittal, the paying agent
will promptly pay the stockholder the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder is entitled. Stockholders who hold shares of GCP common
stock in book-entry form (other than shares held through The Depository Trust Company) will not be required to deliver stock certificates to the
paying agent to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled. Holders of shares of GCP common stock in book-entry form who hold
such shares through The Depository Trust Company will not be required to deliver an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive
the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled.
After the completion of the Merger, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
you will no longer have any rights as a GCP stockholder (except that stockholders who hold Dissenting Shares will not have the right to receive
the Merger Consideration but will instead have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their Dissenting Shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described in “The Merger—Appraisal
Rights” on page 69 of this proxy statement and Appendix B to this proxy statement).
Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards (page 60)
At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of GCP common stock (each, a “Company Option”), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, automatically without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company,
be cancelled and entitle the holder thereof to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of
GCP common stock subject to the Company Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price
of such Company Option; provided, that any Company Option with respect to which the exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of GCP restricted stock (“Company Restricted Stock”) and each outstanding award of GCP restricted
stock units (“Company RSUs”), that in each case at such time is vested (including restricted stock units under the Company’s Non-Employee
Directors’ Deferred Compensation Program) or subject solely to service-based vesting conditions will become fully vested and will, automatically
without any required action on the part of the holder or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an
amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares underlying such award of Company Restricted Stock or Company RSUs, as applicable,
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company performance based stock units (a “Company PBU”) that is subject to performance-based
vesting conditions will become vested as to the greater of the number of Shares subject to such Company PBUs that would vest based on (1) the
target level of achievement and (2) the Company’s actual level of achievement of the performance goals set forth in the applicable award agreement
as of the Effective Time, as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee prior to the closing of the Merger, and will, after giving effect to
such vesting, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right
to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of vested Shares underlying such Company PBUs, multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration. Any outstanding Company PBUs (or portion thereof) that are not vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled for no consideration.

Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger (page 47)
The Board, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and carefully reviewing and considering various factors described in
“The Merger—Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger” on page 47 of this proxy statement, unanimously (i)
approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger; (ii) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the Voting
Agreements are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, GCP and its stockholders; (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the
stockholders of GCP for its adoption at the special meeting; and (iv) recommended that GCP’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board recommends that you vote: (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Compensation
Proposal.
Opinion of RBC Capital Markets, LLC (page 51)
GCP retained RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBCCM”) to provide its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of GCP
common stock of the Merger Consideration provided for pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
RBCCM rendered an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 5, 2021, to the Board to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth
therein, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of GCP common stock.
RBCCM’s advice (written or oral) and opinion were provided for the benefit, information and assistance of the Board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its evaluation of the Merger. RBCCM’s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of GCP to engage in the Merger or
the relative merits of the Merger compared to any alternative business strategy or transaction that may be available to GCP or in which GCP might
engage. RBCCM’s opinion does not constitute an opinion or recommendation to any holder of GCP common stock as to how such holder should
vote or act with respect to the Merger or any proposal to be voted upon in connection with the Merger or otherwise.
The full text of RBCCM’s written opinion, dated December 5, 2021, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix C, and constitutes part of this
proxy statement. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and
qualifications of the review undertaken by RBCCM in rendering its opinion. GCP urges holders of GCP common stock to read RBCCM’s opinion
carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the
review undertaken by RBCCM.
For a further discussion of RBCCM’s opinion, GCP’s relationship with RBCCM and the terms of RBCCM’s engagement, see “The Merger—Opinion
of RBC Capital Markets, LLC” beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement.
Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger (page 60)
When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that certain of our directors
and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was
aware of these interests in, among other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement
be adopted by the stockholders of GCP. These interests include the following:
●
Executive Severance Agreements with GCP. Our executive officers are covered by agreements or arrangements under which they are
eligible for severance benefits upon the qualifying termination of
7
Table of Contents
the executive officer’s employment without “Cause” or by the executive officer for “Good Reason,” as described in “The Merger—
Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger—Executive Severance Benefits” on page 62 of this proxy
statement;
●
Conversion of Equity Awards. Our directors and executive officers hold equity awards, the treatment of which is described in “The
Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger—Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards” on
page 60 of this proxy statement;
●
Retention Bonuses. Certain of our executive officers have entered into retention incentive agreements with us under which they will,
assuming closing of the Merger within 12 months after signing the Merger Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions to
payment of such awards set forth in the retention incentive agreements, be eligible to receive retention bonus awards, 50% of which
will be payable within 60 days following the consummation of the Merger and 50% of which will be payable within 60 days following
the date that is 90 days following the consummation of the Merger and the amounts and terms of which are described in “The Merger
—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger—Retention Bonuses” on page 66 of this proxy statement;
and
●
Indemnification Rights. Our directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, our organizational documents and certain indemnification agreements, as well as directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance.
If the Merger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the Merger is completed, any vested shares of GCP common stock held by our directors
and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of GCP common stock held by all other stockholders entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration.
These interests are discussed in more detail in “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger” on page 60 of
this proxy statement.
Voting Agreements (page 107)
Parent and Merger Sub have entered into the Voting Agreements with (i) Starboard and (ii) Standard (collectively, the “Voting Agreement
Stockholders”), which contain substantially similar terms. Under the Voting Agreements, the Voting Agreement Stockholders have agreed, subject to
the terms and conditions in the applicable Voting Agreement and during the term of the applicable Voting Agreement, to vote (or cause to be voted)
all of their shares of GCP common stock (1) in favor of (a) the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (b) any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting of GCP’s stockholders to a later
date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and (2) against (x) any action or agreement which the Board recommends voting
against and which would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to consummate the Merger as specified in the Merger Agreement
either not being satisfied or being materially impaired or delayed in being able to be satisfied and (y) any alternative acquisition proposals. The
Voting Agreements terminate immediately and automatically upon the earliest to occur of (1) the termination of the Merger Agreement; (2) any
change of recommendation effected by the Board in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; (3) the Effective Time; (4)
the Outside Date (defined in the Merger Agreement); (5) any change to certain terms of the Merger without the prior written consent of the Voting
Agreement Stockholders; or (6) the mutual written consent of Parent and the Voting Agreement Stockholders. The Voting Stockholders are also
subject to certain restrictions on (i) transfers of their shares of GCP common stock and (ii) solicitation with respect to acquisition proposals, as
described in “Voting Agreements” on page 107 of this proxy statement.
As of the Record Date, Starboard and Standard held, in the aggregate, approximately 8.8% and 24.0%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of GCP
common stock.

Rights Agreement Amendment (page 109)
On December 5, 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, GCP entered into the Second Amendment to Rights Agreement
(the “Second Amendment” and, together with the Rights Agreement, the “Amended Rights Agreement”), by and between GCP and Equiniti Trust
Company, as rights agent (the “Rights Agent”), which amends the Rights Agreement dated as of March 15, 2019, by and between GCP and the
Rights Agent (the “Original Rights Agreement”), as amended by the First Amendment to Rights Agreement (the “First Amendment” and, together
with the Original Rights Agreement, the “Rights Agreement”), by and between the Company and the Rights Agent on March 13, 2020.
The Second Amendment provides that none of Saint-Gobain, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates or Associates (as such
terms are defined in the Rights Agreement), either individually or collectively, shall be deemed to be an Acquiring Person (as defined in the
Amended Rights Agreement) as a result of (i) the approval, adoption, execution, delivery and, if applicable, any amendment, of the Merger
Agreement or the Voting Agreements, (ii) the acquisition or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of the common stock of GCP as a result of
execution of the Merger Agreement; (iii) the execution and entry of the Voting Agreements by the parties thereto; (iv) the exercise by Parent of its
rights under the Merger Agreement and the Voting Agreements; or (v) the public announcement and consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreements. Further, the Second Amendment provides that none of the
execution, delivery or performance of the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreements, or the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreements, will result in a Shares Acquisition Date (as defined in the Rights
Agreement) or Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or permit any Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to be exercised or
exchanged pursuant to the Rights Agreement.
Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Amended Rights Agreement and the rights issued thereunder will terminate and expire immediately prior to
the Effective Time, but subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time without any payment in respect thereof.
Guarantee (page 86)
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Saint-Gobain has agreed to guarantee the due, punctual and complete performance and payment in full of all
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. If, for any reason whatsoever, Parent and Merger Sub fail or
are unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform such obligations, Saint-Gobain will promptly pay or perform, or cause to be paid or
performed, such obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing, Saint-Gobain has agreed to take, and to cause to be taken by its affiliates and
subsidiaries (including Parent and Merger Sub), all actions required to be taken by Parent pursuant to and in accordance with certain terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement relating to approvals, consents and filings, with respect to the assets, properties or businesses of Saint-Gobain
and its affiliates and subsidiaries.
Appraisal Rights (page 69)
Record holders of common stock of GCP will be entitled to seek statutory appraisal of their shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL in
connection with the Merger. This means that such stockholders are entitled to seek appraisal of their Dissenting Shares and, if all requirements of
Section 262 are met, to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of such Dissenting Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amount determined to be the fair value. The ultimate amount holders receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the
amount such holders would have received under the Merger Agreement. For a description of the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares and of the
9
Table of Contents
procedures to be followed in order to assert such rights and obtain payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, see Section 262 of the
DGCL, which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement, as well as the information set forth below.
IN ORDER TO PROPERLY EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, A RECORD HOLDER MUST DELIVER
A WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL TO GCP BEFORE
THE VOTE IS TAKEN ON THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AT THE SPECIAL MEETING, MUST NOT VOTE, IN PERSON OR BY
PROXY, IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL, MUST CONTINUE TO HOLD SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK OF RECORD FROM THE
DATE OF MAKING THE DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER AND MUST COMPLY WITH THE
OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. BECAUSE, UNDER DELAWARE LAW, ONLY A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD CAN
SUBMIT A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL, A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD
IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY
SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL AND IN A TIMELY MANNER TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS. MERELY VOTING AGAINST THE MERGER
PROPOSAL WILL NOT PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. BECAUSE A PROXY THAT IS SIGNED
AND SUBMITTED BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE CONTAIN VOTING INSTRUCTIONS WILL, UNLESS REVOKED, BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE
ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, IF YOU SUBMIT A PROXY AND WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU MUST
INCLUDE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTE YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK AGAINST, OR ABSTAIN WITH RESPECT TO, THE
ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. NEITHER VOTING AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, NOR
ABSTAINING FROM VOTING OR FAILING TO VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL, WILL IN AND OF ITSELF CONSTITUTE A WRITTEN
DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. THE WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL
MUST BE IN ADDITION TO AND SEPARATE FROM ANY PROXY OR VOTE ON THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. IF YOU
HOLD YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE AND YOU WISH TO EXERCISE
APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE
PROCEDURES FOR THE MAKING OF A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL BY SUCH BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE. IN VIEW OF THE
COMPLEXITY OF THE DGCL, STOCKHOLDERS WHO MAY WISH TO PURSUE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD PROMPTLY CONSULT THEIR
LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 75)
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GCP common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger” on page 76 of this proxy statement) in exchange for such U.S. holder’s shares of GCP common stock in the Merger will generally result in
the recognition of taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash such U.S. holder receives in the Merger
(including any cash required to be withheld for tax purposes) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such surrendered shares. Gain or loss will
be determined separately for each block of shares of GCP common stock (that is, shares acquired for the same cost in a single transaction). A non-
U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” on page 77 of this proxy statement) will
generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of such non-U.S. holder’s shares of GCP common stock for cash in
the Merger unless (1) such non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States or (2) GCP is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real
property

holding corporation. Stockholders should refer to “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” on page 75 of this
proxy statement, and consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the Merger in light of their
particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 79)
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), has expired or been terminated and clearance of the Merger has been granted under the
antitrust and foreign investment laws of certain specified foreign jurisdictions. The Merger Agreement contains covenants by Parent and Merger
Sub to use their best efforts (including, if necessary, through litigation or the sale, divestiture or disposition of assets) to obtain regulatory approval
for the Merger under applicable competition laws, including the HSR Act, and foreign investment laws.
No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation (page 92)
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, we have agreed that after the date of the Merger Agreement we will, and will cause our
subsidiaries to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause our and our subsidiaries’ representatives to, (x) promptly cease and cause to be terminated
any and all activities, discussions or negotiations with any third party conducted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to any
acquisition proposal, including immediately terminating all access granted to any third party to any physical or electronic data room, and (y) request
that any such third party (and its agents and advisors) promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning GCP and its subsidiaries
that was furnished by or on behalf of GCP and its subsidiaries.
Under the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, from and after the date of the Merger Agreement, we have agreed not to, and to cause
our subsidiaries and our and our subsidiaries’ respective directors, officers, and employees not to, and to direct and use reasonable best efforts to
cause our and our subsidiaries’ other respective representatives on their behalf not to, directly or indirectly:
●
initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly facilitate, encourage or induce the making, the submission or the announcement of any acquisition
proposal;
●
conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information relating to GCP or any of its
subsidiaries, to any third party or its representatives, or afford to any third party or its representatives access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information of GCP or its subsidiaries, in each case, that could reasonably be
expected to lead to the submission of an acquisition proposal;
●
except where the Board makes a good faith determination that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with GCP directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law, amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of
equity securities of GCP or any of its subsidiaries;
●
approve, recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, term sheet or other
contract relating to any acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction, other than a confidentiality agreement in the circumstance and
upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement; or
●
except as expressly contemplated in the Merger Agreement, terminate, waive or amend or grant any exemptions under or redeem any
rights under the Company’s stockholder rights plan.

Table of Contents
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions (collectively, the “no shop restrictions”), under certain circumstances following receipt of a bona fide
written acquisition proposal from a third party, we may (i) furnish information with respect to GCP and its subsidiaries to the third party making such
acquisition proposal and its representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that is no less favorable to GCP than its confidentiality
agreement with Saint-Gobain and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such third party regarding such acquisition proposal (as
described in “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation” on page 92 of this proxy statement).
Under certain circumstances following receipt of a superior proposal, the Board may, prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval, effect a change
of recommendation with respect to such superior proposal and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a company acquisition agreement
with respect to such superior proposal pursuant to the terms thereof, in either case, subject to compliance with certain notice and other requirements
as set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described in “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation” on
page 93 of this proxy statement). In addition, GCP shall not be permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement for a superior proposal unless GCP pays
the termination fee described in “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” on page 104 of this proxy statement.
In response to an intervening event prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval, the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may effect a
change of recommendation subject to compliance with certain notice and other requirements as set forth in the Merger Agreement (see “The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation” on page 94 of this proxy statement).
For a further discussion of the limitations on solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties and the Board’s ability to make a change of
recommendation with respect to the Merger Proposal, see “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation”
on page 92 of this proxy statement.
Conditions to the Closing of the Merger (page 101)
The parties expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022. However, it is possible that factors outside of each party’s control could
require them to complete the Merger at a later time or not to complete it at all. The following are some of the conditions that must be satisfied or,
where permitted by law, waived before the Merger may be completed:
●
the approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement by the vote of holders of a majority of shares of GCP common stock
outstanding as of the record date and entitled to vote on the matter (the “stockholder approval”);
●
the consummation of the Merger not being restrained, made illegal, enjoined or otherwise prohibited by any order or other legal or
regulatory restraint or prohibition (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of a court of competent jurisdiction or any other
governmental entity;
●
the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act (including any timing agreement with the U.S. Department of
Justice or Federal Trade Commission), and all waivers, consents, clearances, approvals and authorizations under other specified
competition laws having been obtained (see “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger” on page 79 of this proxy
statement);
●
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of GCP, on the one hand, and of Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in the
Merger Agreement, subject in some instances to materiality or “material adverse effect” qualifiers, at and as of the effective date of
the Merger (except for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specific date or time);
12
Table of Contents
●
the performance or compliance in all material respects by GCP, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of or
with their respective obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed or complied with by them under the Merger
Agreement on or before the closing date of the Merger; and
●
since the date of the Merger Agreement, there not having occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in “The Merger
Agreement—Representations and Warranties” on page 86 of this proxy statement).
Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 102)
In general, the Merger Agreement may be validly terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time in the following ways (subject to certain
limitations and exceptions):
●
By mutual written consent of Parent and GCP.
●
By either Parent or GCP:
●
If GCP’s stockholders fail to approve the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof;
●
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity of competent
jurisdiction has enacted, issued or promulgated any legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition or issued or entered any order or
taken any other action that makes illegal, permanently restrains, permanently enjoins or otherwise permanently prohibits the
consummation of the Merger, and such legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition, order or other action has become final and
non-appealable; or
●
If the Effective Time has not occurred on or before September 6, 2022 (the “Initial Outside Date” and, as it may be extended from
time to time in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the “Outside Date”) or, if applicable, the then-scheduled
Outside Date.
●
By GCP:
●
If, prior to receiving the stockholder approval, in order to concurrently enter into a definitive written acquisition agreement for a
transaction that constitutes a superior proposal if (i) GCP has complied in all material respects with its obligations under the
terms of the Merger Agreement with respect to such superior proposal; (ii) prior to or concurrently with such termination, GCP
pays the termination fee described in “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” on page 104 of this proxy statement; and (iii)
substantially concurrently with such termination, GCP enters into such definitive written acquisition agreement; or
●
If (i) Parent or Merger Sub has breached any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in
the Merger Agreement such that any of the related closing conditions is not reasonably capable of being satisfied while such
breach is continuing, (ii) GCP has delivered to Parent written notice of such breach and (iii) such breach is either not capable of
being cured or is not cured prior to the earlier of (x) the then-scheduled Outside Date or (y) the date that is 30 days since the
date of delivery of notice of such breach to Parent.
●
By Parent:
●
If, prior to GCP receiving the stockholder approval, the Board makes a change of recommendation (as described in “The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers; Change of Recommendation” on page 92 of this proxy statement); or
●
If (i) GCP has breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement such that any of the related
closing conditions is not reasonably capable of being
13
Table of Contents
satisfied while such breach is continuing, (ii) Parent has delivered to GCP written notice of such breach and (iii) such breach is
either not capable of being cured or is not cured prior to the earlier of (x) the then-scheduled Outside Date or (y) 30 days since
the date of delivery of notice of such breach to GCP.
Termination Fee (page 104)
Under the Merger Agreement, GCP may be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $71.0 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under
specified circumstances. In no event will GCP be required to pay a termination fee more than once. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee”
on page 104 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the circumstances under which GCP will be required to pay a termination fee.
Fees and Expenses (page 106)
Except in specified circumstances, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses.
Market Prices and Dividend Data (page 113)
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “GCP.” On November 30, 2021, the last trading day before a media report was published
speculating about a potential sale of the Company, the closing price of GCP common stock on the NYSE was $23.34 per share. On December 3, 2021,
the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, the closing price of GCP common stock on the
NYSE was $27.02 per share. On January 28, 2022, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of
GCP common stock on the NYSE was $31.96 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market prices of GCP common stock in connection with
voting your shares of GCP common stock.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of the Merger
Agreement, we may not declare or pay dividends to our common stockholders without Parent’s written consent.
Delisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock (page 100)
As promptly as practicable following the completion of the Merger, GCP common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the
Exchange Act and we will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of GCP common stock.
Litigation Relating to the Merger (page 99)
On January 18, 2022, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”), an individual complaint was filed by a
purported GCP stockholder in connection with the Merger. A second individual complaint was filed on January 21, 2022 in the SDNY, a third
individual complaint was filed on January 28, 2022 in the SDNY, and a fourth individual complaint was filed on January 29, 2022 in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaints are captioned as follows: Stein v. GCP Applied Technologies, Inc., et al., Case
No. 1:22-cv-00436; and Waterman v. GCP Applied Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00583; Le v. GCP Applied Technologies Inc., et al.,
Case No. 1:22-cv-00750; and Newman v. GCP Applied Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00545. The complaints name as defendants GCP
and members of the Board. The complaints generally allege that the defendants filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy
statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial projections of GCP, (ii) certain financial analyses of
RBCCM, and (iii) the amount of certain compensation provided to RBCCM unrelated to the Merger. The Le complaint also alleges that the sale
process leading up to the Merger and the disclosure relating thereto was flawed, and certain conflicts of interest of GCP’s management in the
Merger. The Newman complaint also alleges that the disclosure relating to the sale process leading up to the Merger was flawed. The complaints
seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, damages, and other relief.
The defendants believe the claims asserted in these complaints are without merit. Additional lawsuits related to the Merger may be filed in the
future.

GCP Applied Technologies Inc._20220131_DEFM14A_19806508_4372223.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting, the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of December 5, 2021 (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Cyclades Parent, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Cyclades Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), GCP
Applied Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation (“GCP,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), and, solely for purposes set forth therein, Compagnie
de Saint-Gobain S.A., a société anonyme organized under the laws of France, and the merger of Merger Sub with and into GCP in accordance with the
Merger Agreement (the “Merger”). These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of GCP.
Please refer to the preceding section of this proxy statement entitled “Summary” and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy
statement, its appendices, including the Merger Agreement, and the documents incorporated by reference herein, which you should read carefully and in
their entirety.
Q: Why am I receiving these materials?
A: On December 5, 2021, GCP entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into GCP, with
GCP surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference herein. Our Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of GCP common
stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal (each as
described below) to be voted at a special meeting of stockholders or at any adjournments or postponements thereof.
Q: When and where is the special meeting?
A: The special meeting will take place on March 8, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the health
and well-being of our stockholders, employees and their families, the special meeting will be held in a virtual meeting format only, through a live webcast.
You will be able to vote and submit questions by visiting register.proxypush.com/gcp and participating live in the webcast at register.proxypush.com/gcp.
A secure control number that will allow you to participate in the meeting electronically can be found on the enclosed proxy card. For purposes of
attendance at the special meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present in person” or “in person” shall mean virtually present at the special
meeting.
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A: To be able to vote on the matters presented at the special meeting, you must have been a stockholder of record at the close of business on January 14,
2022 (the “Record Date”). The aggregate number of shares entitled to vote at this meeting is 73,935,805 shares of GCP common stock, which is the number
of shares that were outstanding as of the Record Date.
Q: How many votes do I have?
A: Each share of GCP common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the Record Date entitles you to one vote on each matter that is voted
on at the special meeting.
Q: May I attend the special meeting and vote in person?
A: Yes. All stockholders of record as of the Record Date may attend the special meeting and vote online, by mail or by phone. To register for the virtual
meeting along with voting your shares, visit
15Table of Contents
register.proxypush.com/gcp. You will then be required to enter your control number which is included with the proxy materials. After registering, you will
receive a confirmation email and an email approximately one hour prior to the start of the special meeting to the email address you provided during
registration with a unique link to the virtual meeting. For purposes of attendance at the special meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present
in person” or “in person” shall mean virtually present at the special meeting.
Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy to ensure that
your shares of GCP common stock will be represented at the special meeting. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person, your vote by ballot will
revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of GCP common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or nominee, you should instruct your
broker, bank or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of GCP common stock using the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee.
Your broker, bank or nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the Merger Proposal (as described below), without your instructions. If you
hold your shares of GCP common stock in “street name,” because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares of GCP common
stock in person at the special meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy in your name from your broker, bank or nominee.
Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
A: You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
●
to adopt the Merger Agreement (“Merger Proposal”);
●
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”); and
●
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the Merger (the “Compensation Proposal”).
Q: What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on GCP?
A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of GCP by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Proposal is approved by the holders of
GCP common stock and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into GCP, with
GCP continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, GCP will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. GCP will cooperate with
Parent to de-list GCP common stock from the NYSE and de-register under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and, at such time, GCP will no longer be a publicly traded company and will no longer be required to
file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.
Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive $32.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the “Merger
Consideration”), for each share of GCP common stock that you own, unless you are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal rights and have
complied in all respects with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100
shares of GCP common stock, you will be entitled to receive $3,200 in cash in exchange for such shares, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes. In either case, as a result of the Merger, your shares will be cancelled and you will not own shares in GCP or the Surviving Corporation,
which will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent following the Merger.
16
Table of Contents
Q: How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of GCP common stock prior to the public announcement of the Merger
Agreement?
A: The Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 37% over the closing price of GCP common stock on November 30, 2021, the last
trading day before a media report was published speculating about a potential sale process, and a premium of 39% over the 30-day volume-weighted
average on the same date.
Q: What do I need to do now? If I am going to attend the special meeting, should I still submit a proxy?
A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, its appendices, including the Merger Agreement, and the documents incorporated by reference
herein, carefully and in their entirety and consider how the Merger affects you. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting in person, we
encourage you to complete, sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card so that your shares of GCP common stock may be
represented and can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares of GCP common stock in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction
forms provided by your broker, bank or nominee to vote such shares.
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A: No. If the Merger Proposal is approved, shortly after the Merger is completed, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will receive a letter of
transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the Merger
Consideration for each share of GCP common stock represented by the stock certificate or book-entry shares. You should use the letter of transmittal to
exchange your stock certificates or book-entry shares for the cash payment to which you are entitled upon completion of the Merger. If your shares of
GCP common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, broker or nominee as to
how to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares of GCP common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Please do not send in your
stock certificates now.
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of GCP common stock after the Record Date but before the special meeting? What happens
if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of GCP common stock after the special meeting but before the Effective Time?
A: The Record Date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and earlier than the date the Merger is expected to be completed.
If you sell or transfer your shares of GCP common stock after the Record Date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies GCP in writing of such
special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the special meeting, but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration
if the Merger is completed to the person to whom you sell or transfer such shares.
If you sell or transfer your shares of GCP common stock after the special meeting, but before the Effective Time, you will transfer the right to receive the
Merger Consideration if the Merger is completed. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of GCP common stock
through the completion of the Merger.
The right to seek appraisal of GCP common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL is only available to GCP stockholders
who, among other requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, hold their stock as of the date of making a demand for appraisal and hold their
shares continuously through the effective date of the Merger. Accordingly, if you sell or transfer your shares of GCP common stock after the special
meeting, but before the effective date of the Merger, you will lose the right to seek appraisal of those shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.
17
Table of Contents
Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of GCP common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy or, if your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or nominee, instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote your
shares using the voting instruction form furnished by your broker, bank or nominee.
Q: What is the position of GCP’s Board of Directors regarding the Merger?
A: After consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after reviewing and considering the terms and conditions of the Merger and
the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, the Board unanimously (i) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger
Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; (ii) determined that the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the Voting Agreements are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of,
GCP and its stockholders; (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of GCP for its adoption at the special meeting; and
(iv) recommended that GCP’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board recommends that you vote: (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Compensation
Proposal.
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the stockholders of GCP or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, you will not receive any
payment for your shares of common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, GCP common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the
NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in “The
Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” on page 104 of this proxy statement.
Q: Do any of GCP’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of GCP stockholders generally?
A: In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that certain of our directors and
executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of
these interests in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of
GCP. For a description of these interests, see “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger” on page 60 of this
proxy statement.
Q: Have any stockholders agreed to vote for the Merger Proposal?
A: Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of GCP common stock “FOR” the Merger
Proposal. In addition, Starboard and Standard have agreed to vote “FOR” for the Merger Proposal.
Q: What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of GCP common stock outstanding as of the Record Date and entitled to vote on the
matter is required to approve the Merger Proposal.
18
Table of Contents
The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card or to vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. Broker non-votes (if any) and abstentions will also have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal.
As of the Record Date (January 14, 2022), there were 73,935,805 shares of GCP common stock issued and outstanding. Each holder of GCP common stock
is entitled to one vote per share of GCP common stock owned by such holder as of the Record Date.
Q: What vote is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal?
A: Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of GCP common stock having a majority of the shares of
GCP common stock present or represented, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting entitled to vote on such matter.
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of GCP common stock having a majority of the shares of
GCP common stock present or represented, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting and entitled to vote on such matter.
Assuming a quorum is present, the failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card or to vote in person by ballot at the special meeting,
as well as broker non-votes, if any, will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal and the Compensation Proposal.
Q: What is “Merger-related compensation”?
A: “Merger-related compensation” is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the completion of the Merger and may be payable to GCP’s named
executive officers under its existing plans or agreements, which is the subject of the Compensation Proposal. See “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-
Related Named Executive Officer Compensation” on page 112 of this proxy statement.
Q: Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve “Merger-related compensation” payable to GCP’s named executive officers
under its plans or agreements?
A: In accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing you with the opportunity to cast a non-binding,
advisory vote on the compensation that may be payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q: What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the special meeting?
A: Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is on
an advisory basis and will not be binding on GCP or Parent. Further, the underlying compensation plans and agreements are contractual in nature and are
not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, payment of the “Merger-related compensation” is not contingent on stockholder
approval of the Compensation Proposal.
Q: What is a quorum?
A: In order for business to be conducted at the special meeting, our by-laws require that a quorum must be present. A quorum consists of the holders of a
majority of the shares of the GCP common stock outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of directors represented in person or by proxy.

Table of Contents
Shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy (including shares that reflect abstentions) will be counted for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum exists.
Whether or not a quorum is present, the special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shares so represented at
the special meeting until a quorum is obtained.
Q: How do I vote?
A: Stockholder of record: Shares registered in your name: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, your shares are registered in your own name, not in
“street name” by a bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary).
●
You may submit a proxy via the Internet. To submit a proxy via the Internet, log on to the website listed on the proxy card and follow the
on-screen instructions, using the Company Number and Account Number shown on your proxy card when prompted. We permit Internet
proxies to allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares on-line, with procedures designed to ensure the authenticity and correctness of
your proxy vote instructions. You must submit your Internet proxy before the special meeting, for your proxy to vote your shares to be
counted at the special meeting. Please be aware that you must bear any costs associated with your Internet access, such as usage charges
from Internet access providers and telephone companies.
●
You may submit a proxy by mail. If you received our proxy materials by mail, you may complete, date and sign the proxy card that
accompanies our proxy statement and promptly return it in the postage-paid envelope provided so that it is received prior to the special
meeting. You do not need to put a stamp on the enclosed envelope if you mail it from within the United States. The persons named in the
proxy card will vote the shares you own in accordance with your instructions on the proxy card you mail. If you return the proxy card, but
do not give any instructions on a particular matter to be voted on at the special meeting, the persons named in the proxy card will vote the
shares you own in accordance with the recommendations of our Board. Our Board recommends that you vote FOR the Merger Proposal,
FOR the Adjournment Proposal and FOR the Compensation Proposal. GCP must receive your proxy card no later than March 7, 2022, the
day before the special meeting, for your proxy to vote your shares to be counted at the special meeting.
●
You may submit a proxy by phone. You may vote toll-free by telephone by calling 1-866-883-3382 in the U.S., U.S. territories and Canada
on a touch tone telephone and following the instructions provided on the telephone line. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. Easy-to-follow voice prompts allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your instructions have been recorded
properly. If you vote by telephone, you do not need to return a proxy card. Please see the Notice for telephone voting instructions.
Beneficial owner: Shares held in “street name.” If the shares you own are held in “street name” by a bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary, then
your bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary, as the record holder of your shares, is required to vote your shares according to your instructions. In
order to vote your shares, you will need to follow the voting instructions your bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary provides you. Many banks,
brokerage firms and other intermediaries also offer the option of submitting voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone, instructions for which
would be provided to you by your bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary.
If you wish to attend the special meeting to personally vote your shares held in “street name,” you will need to obtain a legal proxy from the holder of
record (i.e. your bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary); a legal proxy is not the form of proxy card enclosed with this proxy statement.
Q: If my broker, bank or nominee holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker, bank or nominee vote my shares for me?
A: Not without your direction. Your broker, bank or nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares on any proposal at the special meeting if you
instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote. Under
20
Table of Contents
applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks or nominees have the discretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your broker,
bank or nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and brokers,
banks and nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or
nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of GCP common stock.
You should follow the procedures provided by your broker, bank or nominee regarding the voting of your shares of GCP common stock. Generally, if a
broker exercises its discretion on routine matters at a stockholder meeting, a stockholder’s shares will be voted on the routine matter in the manner
directed by the broker, but will constitute a “broker non-vote” on all of the non-routine matters to be presented at the stockholder meeting. Because all of
the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are non-routine matters, if you hold your shares in street name through a brokerage account, your
broker will not be able to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on any of the proposals presented at the special meeting. As a result, we do
not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. Broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Adjournment Proposal or the
Compensation Proposal.
Q: May I revoke my proxy after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise submitted my vote by proxy?
A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your earlier proxy and/or change your vote at any time before the special meeting by taking
one of the following actions (only your latest-dated proxy that received prior to the special meeting will be counted):
●
completing, signing, dating and mailing another proxy card with a later date before 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day before the special
meeting;
●
submitting a proxy again via the Internet or telephone;
●
giving written notice that you want to revoke your proxy at the following address: GCP Applied Technologies Inc., 2325 Lakeview
Parkway, Alpharetta, Georgia 30009, Attention: Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; or
●
attending the special meeting and voting in person. Your attendance at the meeting alone will not revoke your proxy; you must vote again
or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked.
If you own shares in “street name,” your bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary should provide you with appropriate instructions for changing or
revoking your voting instructions.
Q: If a stockholder submits a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A: Regardless of the method you choose to submit your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares
in the way that you indicate. When completing the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from
voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.
If you sign and properly return your proxy card, but do not include instructions on how to vote, your shares of GCP common stock will be voted as
recommended by the Board with respect to each proposal. It is not currently anticipated that any other proposals for consideration will be presented at
the special meeting. If other proposals requiring a vote of stockholders are brought before the special meeting in a proper manner, the persons named in
the enclosed proxy card, if properly authorized, will have discretion to vote the shares they represent in accordance with their best judgment.
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction
cards. For example, if you hold your shares of GCP
21
Table of Contents
common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold
shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares of GCP common stock are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one
proxy card. Please complete, date, sign and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive. Each proxy card you receive comes with
its own prepaid return envelope; if you submit a proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy
card.
Q: Who will count the votes?
A: The votes will be counted by the independent inspector of election appointed for the special meeting.
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A: GCP intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed
with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that GCP files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” on page 119 of this proxy statement.
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of shares of GCP common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
A: If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” on page 76 of this proxy
statement), the exchange of your shares of GCP common stock for cash (including any cash required to be withheld for tax purposes) pursuant to the
Merger will generally require you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash you receive pursuant to the Merger (including any cash required to be withheld for tax purposes) and your adjusted tax basis in such
surrendered shares. If you are a non-U.S. holder (as defined in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” on page
77 of this proxy statement) you will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of your shares of GCP common stock
for cash in the Merger unless (1) you have certain connections to the United States or (2) GCP is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property
holding corporation. Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal
income tax consequences to you of the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided in “The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” on page 75 of this proxy statement.
Q: What will the holders of GCP stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units receive in the Merger?
A: At the Effective Time, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will,
automatically without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and entitle the holder thereof to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of GCP common stock subject to the Company Option, multiplied by (y)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Company Option; provided, that any Company Option with
respect to which the exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company Restricted Stock and each outstanding award of Company RSUs, that in each case at such
time is vested (including Company RSUs under the Company’s Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred Compensation Program) or subject solely to service-
based vesting conditions will become fully vested and will, automatically without any required action on the part of the holder or the
22
Table of Contents
Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares underlying
such award of Company Restricted Stock or Company RSUs, as applicable, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company PBUs that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions will become vested as to the
greater of the number of Shares subject to such Company PBUs that would vest based on (1) the target level of achievement and (2) the Company’s
actual level of achievement of the performance goals set forth in the applicable award agreement as of the Effective Time, as determined by the Board or
its Compensation Committee prior to the closing of the Merger, and will, after giving effect to such vesting, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to (x) the
number of vested Shares underlying such Company PBUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. Any outstanding Company PBUs (or portion
thereof) that are not vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled for no consideration.
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A: We are working towards completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022.
However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to conditions, including adoption of the
Merger Agreement by the stockholders of GCP and the receipt of regulatory approvals.
Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A: Yes. As a holder of GCP common stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger if you take certain
actions and meet certain conditions. See “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” on page 69 of this proxy statement.
Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?
A: Some banks, brokers and other nominee record holders may be participating in the practice of “householding” proxy statements and annual reports.
This means that only one copy of our proxy statement may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household. We will promptly deliver a
separate copy of either document to you if our Investor Relations Department receives a call or written request from you at the address, telephone
number or email address indicated below.

At the special meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the Record Date to consider and vote on the following proposals:
(i)
to adopt the Merger Agreement;
(ii)
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are

Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date (January 14, 2022) are entitled to notice of the special meeting and to vote at
the special meeting or at any adjournments or postponements thereof. Each holder of record of GCP common stock on the Record Date will be entitled to
one vote for each share of GCP common stock held as of the Record Date on each matter submitted to our stockholders for approval at the special
meeting. If you sell or transfer your shares of GCP common stock after the Record Date but before the special meeting, you will transfer the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of GCP common stock, but you will
retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting.
As of the Record Date, there were 73,935,805 shares of GCP common stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the special meeting.
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a special meeting. The holders of a majority of the shares of GCP common stock entitled to vote at the
special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. As a result, 36,967,903 shares must be
represented by proxy or by stockholders present and entitled to vote at the special meeting to have a quorum. Shares that abstain on one or more of the
proposals before the special meeting will be deemed to be present for quorum purposes. If you hold your shares in “street name” and you fail to provide
your broker, bank or nominee with instructions how to vote such shares on any of the proposals before the special meeting, your shares will not be
deemed to be present at the special meeting for quorum purposes. If you provide your broker, bank or nominee with instructions how to vote on one or
more but not all of the proposals before the special meeting, your shares will be deemed to be present at the special meeting for quorum purposes.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of GCP common stock outstanding as of the Record Date and entitled to vote on the matter
is required to approve the Merger Proposal. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger. A failure
to vote your shares of GCP common stock, an abstention from voting or a broker non-vote (if any) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of GCP common stock present, in person or

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an aggregate of 419,806 shares of GCP common
stock (excluding any shares that would be delivered upon exercise or conversion, as applicable, of GCP stock options or GCP restricted stock units and
excluding shares beneficially owned by Starboard), representing approximately 0.6% of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock. Our directors and
executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of GCP common stock: (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR”
the Adjournment Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.
As of the Record Date, Starboard and certain affiliates of Standard beneficially owned and are entitled to vote an aggregate of 6,540,000 and 17,778,352

If your shares of GCP common stock are registered in your name with our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you may cause your shares to be voted
at the special meeting by submitting your proxy or by voting in person at the special meeting. Based on your proxy cards, the proxy holders will vote
your shares of GCP common stock according to your directions.
If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote virtually, you will need to provide the secure control number provided in your proxy card
voting instruction form, or in the email sending you the proxy statement. If you attend the special meeting, and vote virtually, your vote will revoke any
proxy previously submitted. If your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special
meeting virtually.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares of GCP common stock represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the
special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly executed proxies that do not contain
voting instructions will be voted (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.
If your shares of GCP common stock are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or nominee, you may provide voting instructions through your
broker, bank or nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your broker, bank or nominee, or over the Internet or by telephone
through your broker, bank or nominee if such a service is provided. To provide voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone through your broker,
bank or nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your broker, bank or nominee. Under applicable stock exchange
rules, brokers, banks or nominees have the discretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how to
vote your shares with respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and brokers, banks and nominees therefore
cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Generally, if a broker exercises its discretion on routine matters at a stockholder meeting, a
stockholder’s shares will be voted on the routine matter in the manner directed by the broker, but will constitute a “broker non-vote” on all of the non-
routine matters to be presented at the stockholder meeting. Because all of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are non-routine matters, if
you hold your shares in street name through a brokerage account, your broker will not be able to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on
any of the proposals presented at the special meeting. As a result, we do not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. If you do not return
your broker’s, bank’s or nominee’s voting form, do not provide voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone through your broker, bank or other
nominee, if applicable, or do not attend the special meeting and vote in person with a proxy from your broker, bank or nominee, such actions will have the
same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal, but assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the
Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal.

stockholders and cost savings for companies. Stockholders who hold their shares through a nominee, such as a broker, bank, broker-dealer or similar
organization may receive notice from that nominee regarding the householding of proxy materials. As indicated in the notice, a single proxy statement will

stockholder has received notice that a nominee will be householding, such householding will continue until the stockholder is notified otherwise or until
the stockholder has revoked consent by notifying the nominee. If you hold your shares in “street name” and would prefer to receive separate copies of a

Rights of Stockholders Who Assert Appraisal Rights",35,36

Record holders of shares of common stock who have not voted in favor of the Merger, have properly demanded appraisal rights for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and have complied in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares (“Dissenting
Shares”) will be entitled to statutory appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the Merger. This means that such
stockholders are entitled to seek appraisal of their Dissenting Shares and, if all requirements of Section 262 are met, to receive payment in cash for the
“fair value” of such Dissenting Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The ultimate amount holders
receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount such holders would have received under the Merger Agreement.
For a description of the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares and of the procedures to be followed in order to assert such rights and obtain payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, see Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement, as well as the information
set forth below.
IN ORDER TO PROPERLY EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, A RECORD HOLDER MUST DELIVER A
WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL TO GCP BEFORE THE VOTE
IS TAKEN ON THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AT THE SPECIAL MEETING, AND MUST NOT VOTE, IN PERSON OR BY PROXY, IN
FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL AND CONTINUE TO HOLD YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK OF RECORD FROM THE DATE OF
MAKING THE DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER AND MUST COMPLY WITH THE OTHER
REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. BECAUSE, UNDER DELAWARE LAW, ONLY A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD CAN SUBMIT A
DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL, A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME
OF ANOTHER PERSON MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE
DGCL AND IN A TIMELY MANNER TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS. MERELY VOTING AGAINST THE MERGER PROPOSAL WILL NOT
PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. BECAUSE A PROXY THAT IS SIGNED AND SUBMITTED BUT DOES
NOT OTHERWISE CONTAIN VOTING INSTRUCTIONS WILL, UNLESS REVOKED, BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, IF YOU SUBMIT A PROXY AND WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU MUST INCLUDE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS
TO VOTE YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK AGAINST, OR ABSTAIN WITH RESPECT TO, THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT. NEITHER VOTING AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER

AGREEMENT, NOR ABSTAINING FROM VOTING OR FAILING TO VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL, WILL IN AND OF ITSELF CONSTITUTE A

APPRAISAL MUST BE IN ADDITION TO AND SEPARATE FROM ANY PROXY OR VOTE ON THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. IF

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into GCP, with GCP
continuing as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. GCP will cooperate with Parent to de-list GCP common stock from
the NYSE and to de-register under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, and at such time, we will cease to be
a publicly traded company and will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of
the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, and instead will only be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in “—Merger
Consideration” on page 34 of this proxy statement or, with respect to Dissenting Shares, will only be entitled to receive the “fair value” of your
Dissenting Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law.
The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as we and
Parent may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).

payment for your shares of GCP common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, GCP common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the
NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will be required to continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Furthermore, depending on the circumstances that would have caused the Merger not to be completed, it is possible that the price of GCP common stock
will decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of GCP common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of
the date of this proxy statement.

GCP Applied Technologies Inc._20220131_DEFM14A_19806508_4372223.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
In the ordinary course, our Board and management team regularly review and assess our results of operations, financial position, business strategy and
growth opportunities, as well as the trends and conditions affecting our industries and business generally. Such assessments include periodic meetings
or consultations with third-party advisors, as well as consideration of potential strategic and financial alternatives to maximize stockholder value, such as
business combinations, acquisitions and financing transactions. Our Board and management team periodically discuss the Company’s business strategy
and potential strategic and financial alternatives to maximize stockholder value.
In February 2019, our Board commenced a process to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company, including a potential sale or other business
combination. In connection with this process, the Company, working with its financial advisor at the time, contacted 36 strategic parties, including Saint-
Gobain and a strategic party referred to as “Party A”, and 12 private equity sponsors, including a private equity sponsor referred to as “Party B.”
Following this outreach, the Company entered into customary confidentiality agreements with five strategic parties, including Party A, and nine private
equity sponsors, including Party B, and furnished customary business and financial diligence information to these parties. Although one strategic party
and one private equity sponsor submitted initial non-binding indications of interest for a potential sale transaction at that time and the Company also
made customary management presentations to these parties, these parties subsequently withdrew from the process and did not submit a final proposal to
acquire the Company. None of Saint-Gobain, Party A or Party B submitted an initial indication of interest at the time or received a management
presentation. Accordingly, the Board determined to continue to execute a standalone business strategy for the Company at that time.
34Table of Contents
From time to time in 2019 and continuing into 2020, the former chief executive officer of the Company and the chief executive officer of Party A discussed
a potential business combination of the Company with Party A. These discussions did not result in a proposal from Party A during that period.
At the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders held on May 28, 2020, a majority of new directors were elected to our Board following a contested
election and proxy contest, including eight directors nominated by Starboard. Mr. Peter Feld was appointed as Chairman of the Board following this
annual meeting of stockholders.
On November 23, 2020, Mr. Feld emailed the chief executive officer of Party A introducing Mr. Bates as the new chief executive officer of the Company.
Mr. Feld believed it would be productive for two chief executive officers in similar businesses to become acquainted. The following day, Mr. Bates
introduced himself to the chief executive officer of Party A via email, indicating that Mr. Bates would contact the chief executive officer of Party A in the
near future.
During the week of January 24, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to become acquainted. The parties discussed their respective
businesses, and the chief executive officer of Party A referenced Party A’s historical interest in considering a possible business combination of the
Company with Party A and prior discussions with the former chief executive officer of the Company, noting that there had always been a significant gap
between the respective views of the two parties about the valuation of the Company.
On August 6, 2021, Mr. Bates and a representative of Party B had a telephone call in which the parties discussed the Company’s business and strategy
generally, and Party B enquired whether the Company would be interested in a conversation to explore potential transaction opportunities with Party B.
Mr. Bates indicated that the Company would be willing to consider exploratory conversations, but that the Company would request that Party B enter
into a customary non-disclosure agreement to facilitate those discussions.
On August 16, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A emailed Mr. Feld and Mr. Bates to request a telephone call to follow up on their prior discussion
regarding Party A’s potential interest in an acquisition of the Company.
Also on August 16, 2021, following up on Party B’s prior inquiry, the Company and Party B signed a customary non-disclosure agreement, which did not
include a standstill provision, to allow for confidential exploratory discussions regarding potential transaction opportunities involving Party B and GCP.
On August 17, 2021, Mr. Bates had a telephone call with the chief executive officer of Party A, during which the chief executive officer of Party A
expressed Party A’s interest in exploring an acquisition of the Company. Mr. Bates stated the Board’s confidence in the Company’s standalone business
plan, but noted that if Party A had significant interest in an acquisition of the Company, Party A should submit a written proposal to the Company.
On August 18, 2021, Mr. Bates and Mr. Valente, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, and representatives of Party B held a
videoconference to discuss the Company’s business and strategy generally, as well as the type of financial information that Party B would require for
exploratory conversations about potential transaction opportunities with Party B.
On August 20, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates to affirm Party A’s interest in the Company and indicated that Party A would
submit a non-binding proposal in writing to acquire the Company. Shortly thereafter, Party A sent its non-binding proposal to acquire GCP for $29.00 per
share of GCP common stock (the “First Party A Proposal”), which consisted of 50% cash (representing $14.50 per share) and
35
Table of Contents
50% newly-issued shares of Party A’s common stock (representing 0.17 shares of Party A common stock per share of GCP common stock ). The non-
binding proposal was subject to due diligence and negotiation of definitive documentation. While the proposal would not be subject to any financing
contingency, Party A indicated its desire to pursue financing, including externally sourced debt. Mr. Bates confirmed receipt of Party A’s non-binding
proposal and indicated that the Board would discuss at an upcoming meeting and he would respond back to the chief executive officer of Party A after
that meeting. On August 17, 2021, the closing price of GCP common stock was $23.49 per share.
On August 26, 2021, the Board held a meeting via videoconference, including management and representatives of Latham & Watkins LLP, outside legal
counsel to GCP (referred to as “Latham”), to review the recent discussions with Party A and Party B and to consider how to respond to the First Party A
Proposal. Management reviewed the business, strategic and financial position of GCP as a standalone company, together with the financial aspects of the
First Party A Proposal. Representatives of Latham provided legal advice regarding the fiduciary duties of the Board in the context of the First Party A
Proposal. After discussion and deliberation, the Board determined that the First Party A Proposal undervalued the Company and was inadequate, that the
Company should continue to execute its existing business strategy, and that management should respond in writing to Party A, declining the First Party
A Proposal. The Board also determined, based on various factors, including, among other things, the Board’s and management’s knowledge of the
Company, the Company’s business, and the industry in which the Company operates, that it did not believe the Company should incur the expense of
engaging a financial advisor at that time, given the Board’s determination not to move forward with the First Party A Proposal.
On August 30, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A and indicated that the Board had unanimously rejected the First Party A
Proposal, believing that the proposal undervalued the Company. Shortly thereafter, the Company sent a letter to the chief executive officer of Party A,
indicating that Party A’s proposal undervalued the Company and did not provide a basis for productive discussion. The Company indicated in the letter
that the interests of the Company and its stockholders would be best served by continuing to pursue the Company’s existing business strategy.
On September 7, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates to indicate Party A’s continued interest in the Company. In this conversation,
the chief executive officer of Party A indicated that Party A could increase the First Party A Proposal above $29.00 per share and could offer all cash
consideration. Mr. Bates relayed this conversation to Mr. Feld in a call on September 9, 2021 and Messrs. Feld and Bates determined to request that Party
A provide a revised proposal in writing.
On September 10, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to request that, if Party A had continued interest in an acquisition of the
Company at a price above $29.00 per share, Party A should submit a revised written proposal to the Company. The chief executive officer of Party A
indicated that he would discuss further with Party A’s board of directors, but proposed an in-person meeting in Florida for October 21, 2021.
On September 15, 2021, Mr. Bates had a telephone call with a representative of Party B to continue exploratory conversations about the potential
transaction opportunities with Party B. The representative of Party B asked if the Company would be open to providing limited financial information to
facilitate further discussions. Mr. Bates responded that the Company would be open to further discussions and that Party B should reach out to Mr. Craig
Merrill, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, to coordinate exchange of limited financial information.
On September 21, 2021, a representative of Party B contacted Mr. Merrill to request limited financial information with respect to the Company. Party B
subsequently emailed a targeted request for financial information regarding the Company to Mr. Merrill.

On September 28, 2021, Mr. Benoit Bazin, the Chief Executive Officer of Saint-Gobain, emailed Mr. Bates to introduce himself and propose an in-person
meeting to discuss potential business opportunities when Mr. Bazin was next in the United States. After discussion with Mr. Feld and members of the
Board, Mr. Bates responded to Mr. Bazin to propose a meeting on October 14, 2021.
On September 29, 2021, Mr. Merrill furnished certain limited financial information regarding the Company to Party B. Mr. Merrill had a telephone call with
representatives of Party B on October 5, 2021 to discuss this information. In response to a follow-up request from Party B, Mr. Merrill provided certain
additional financial information regarding the Company to Party B on October 11, 2021 and October 12, 2021.
On October 14, 2021, Messrs. Bates and Bazin had an in-person meeting in Boston, Massachusetts. Mr. Bazin introduced Saint-Gobain and its business
and strategy, explained the strategic rationale for Saint-Gobain’s purchase of Chryso, a leading global construction chemicals company, completed in
September 2021, noted Saint-Gobain’s view that the Company would fit with Saint-Gobain and its business and strategy, and expressed Saint-Gobain’s
interest in considering a potential acquisition of the Company. Mr. Bates then reviewed the Company’s business and strategy. Mr. Bates stated the
Board’s confidence in the Company’s standalone business plan, but noted that if Saint-Gobain had significant interest in an acquisition of the Company,
Saint-Gobain should submit a written proposal to the Company. No non-public information was exchanged during this meeting.
On October 18, 2021, Saint-Gobain submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for $29.00 per share in cash (the “First Saint-Gobain
Proposal”), conditioned on the Company’s receipt of customary voting agreements from certain of the Company’s stockholders. The First Saint-Gobain
Proposal also indicated that Saint-Gobain had sufficient cash on its balance sheet to fund the purchase price and that the proposal would not be subject
to any financing condition, that Saint-Gobain had the ability to sign and announce within three to four weeks after commencing substantive discussions,
and that the First Saint-Gobain Proposal would be contingent on negotiations being conducted on an expedited bilateral basis. On October 18, 2021, the
closing price of GCP common stock was $22.45 per share.
During the period leading up to the November 1, 2021 meeting of the Board, Messrs. Bates and Feld had numerous conversations, including with other
members of the Board and members of senior management, to discuss the First Saint-Gobain Proposal, the upcoming meeting with the chief executive
officer of Party A, and whether to move forward with formal discussions with Saint-Gobain and Party A with respect to a potential transaction at that time.
Given the expressed interest of two highly credible strategic parties, the opportunity to facilitate a competitive process to realize additional value for the
Company and its stockholders, and the expectation that each of the two strategic bidders would increase their initial non-binding proposals subject to
completion of due diligence, it was determined that the Company should continue preliminary discussions with each of Saint-Gobain and Party A in the
near term, and to discuss whether to move forward with more formal discussions with the full Board at its next meeting.
On October 19, 2021, Mr. Bazin called Mr. Feld to discuss Saint-Gobain’s interest in the Company and to review the First Saint-Gobain Proposal. Mr. Feld
indicated that he would discuss with other Board members and expected the Company to provide initial feedback on process and timing promptly.
On October 21, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A met in person with Mr. Bates in Florida to discuss Party A’s continued interest in a potential
acquisition of the Company and the potential opportunities for synergies from such a merger. Mr. Bates stated that if Party A had continued interest in an
acquisition of the Company, Party A should submit a revised proposal to the Company in writing. The chief executive officer of Party A indicated that,
before Party A could submit a revised proposal to the Company, Party A would need to review confidential financial diligence information regarding the
Company and evaluate potential opportunities for synergies in a proposed transaction. Mr. Bates noted that, based on his discussions with Mr. Feld and
other members of the Board, he expected the Board would prefer an all-cash offer in order to, among other things, maximize certainty of value. No non-
public information was exchanged during this meeting.

On October 23, 2021, Mr. Bates had a call with Mr. Bazin to provide initial feedback on the First Saint-Gobain Proposal. Mr. Bates indicated that the
Company appreciated Saint-Gobain’s interest and he expected the Board to discuss the proposal further at its upcoming meeting, but that the proposal
undervalued the Company. Mr. Bates reiterated the Board’s confidence in the Company’s standalone business plan, and noted that there was another
strategic third party interested in the Company that the Board also would be considering at its upcoming meeting.
On October 26 and 27, 2021, Mr. Bates and Mr. Bazin exchanged emails in which Mr. Bates indicated that, based on his conversations with Mr. Feld and
the significant third party interest in the Company, Mr. Bates anticipated the Board would consider further discussions with Saint-Gobain if Saint-Gobain
would be willing to increase its proposal. Mr. Bazin confirmed that Saint-Gobain expected to be able to increase its offer following its review of financial
due diligence. Mr. Bates noted that further discussions would need to be approved by the Board at its upcoming meeting. The parties discussed that, if
further discussions were approved by the Board, a customary confidentiality agreement would need to be in place, and the Company subsequently
circulated a draft confidentiality agreement to Saint-Gobain.
On October 28, 2021, Saint-Gobain entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with GCP, which included a customary one year standstill
provision. The standstill provision expressly permitted confidential proposals to the Board and was subject to a customary “sunset” provision on the
public announcement of the sale of 50% or more of GCP common stock.
On November 1, 2021, the Board met via videoconference, including Messrs. Merrill and Valente. Messrs. Feld and Bates updated the Board on the recent
discussions with Party A and Saint-Gobain, including the First Saint-Gobain Proposal. Management reviewed the business, operations and financial
performance of the Company, and the Board discussed the opportunity to facilitate a competitive process between two highly credible strategic parties to
realize additional value for the Company and its stockholders. Following this discussion, the Board authorized further discussions with each of Party A
and Saint-Gobain, including management presentations and furnishing certain financial information to allow each party to submit revised proposals to
acquire the Company. In addition, the Board discussed the status of the exploratory discussions with Party B and determined, based on preliminary
nature of those discussions, the Board’s general understanding that a private equity sponsor was unlikely to be in a position to acquire the Company at a
value in excess of a motivated strategic party with identified opportunities for synergies and the Board’s desire for management to focus on facilitating a
competitive process between Party A and Saint-Gobain to maximize value, that the Company should defer further discussions with Party B. The Board
also determined, based on various factors, including, among other things, the Board’s and management’s knowledge of the Company, the Company’s
business and the industry in which the Company operates, that it did not believe the Company should incur the expense of engaging a financial advisor
at that time, but that management should begin confidential discussions with potential financial advisors to be in a position to advise the Board, when
and if revised proposals were obtained that, the Board believed, provided a basis to move forward.
On November 2, 2021, Mr. Bates called Mr. Bazin to indicate that the Board had approved further discussions with Saint-Gobain and another interested
strategic party regarding a potential acquisition of the Company, and that the Company proposed to schedule a management presentation and furnish
certain financial information to allow the bidders to submit revised proposals. Mr. Bates noted the Board continued to have confidence in the Company’s
standalone business plan and had not determined to sell the Company, but had authorized a targeted process to explore whether a potential transaction
would realize additional value for the Company and its stockholders.
Also on November 2, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to indicate that there was another strategic party interested in a potential
acquisition of the Company, and that the Board had determined to invite both Party A and the other strategic party to evaluate the Company in greater
detail, including a management presentation and review of certain limited financial information, after signing a
38

customary confidentiality agreement. Mr. Bates noted the Board continued to have confidence in the Company’s standalone business plan and had not
determined to sell the Company, but had authorized a targeted process to explore whether a potential transaction would realize additional value for the
Company and its stockholders. On November 3, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates and discussed the Company conducting a
presentation to the management of Party A on November 18 and 19, 2021.
On November 3, 2021 and November 4, 2021, the Board met in person in Alpharetta, Georgia. During the meeting, in addition to its regular business, the
Board discussed the status of discussions with Party A and Saint-Gobain, as well as the Company’s standalone business plan and strategy.
On November 4, 2021, Party A signed a customary confidentiality agreement which included a customary eighteen month standstill provision. The
standstill provision expressly permitted confidential proposals to the Board and was subject to a customary “sunset” provision on the public
announcement of the sale of 50% or more of GCP common stock.
On November 11, 2021, Saint-Gobain and the Company entered into a customary clean team agreement, which addressed disclosure of competitively
sensitive information between the parties. Later that day and continuing into November 12, 2021, the Company held a management presentation via an in-
person meeting with Saint-Gobain regarding the Company’s business, products, operations, financial performance and estimates, as well as potential
opportunities for synergies and acquisition opportunities for Saint-Gobain in a potential transaction. Saint-Gobain was subsequently granted access to a
virtual data room that included customary business, financial, accounting, environmental, human resources and legal diligence information, in order for
Saint-Gobain to conduct its due diligence review of the Company. At the conclusion of the meeting, Messrs. Bates and Bazin, together with other
members of senior management of the Company and Saint-Gobain, discussed next steps in the process and timing. Mr. Bates reiterated that the Board
continued to have confidence in the Company’s standalone business plan and had not determined to sell the Company, that the process approved by the
Board was targeted and exploratory only, and that Saint-Gobain would need to improve the First Saint-Gobain Proposal for the Board to move forward
with further discussions.
On November 16, 2021, Party A was granted access to the virtual data room that included customary business, financial, accounting, environmental,
human resources and legal diligence information, in order for Party A to conduct its due diligence review of the Company. On the same date, Party A and
the Company entered into a customary clean team agreement, which addressed disclosure of competitively sensitive information between the parties.
On November 18, 2021, Mr. Feld called Mr. Bazin to discuss the First Saint-Gobain Proposal in greater detail. Mr. Feld noted that the Board appreciated
Saint-Gobain’s interest in the Company and that the Board would fully consider any revised proposal. Mr. Feld shared with Mr. Bazin that the Board
continued to have confidence in the Company’s standalone business plan and that the Board believed that the Company was undervalued. Mr. Feld
informed Mr. Bazin that the Board felt that the First Saint-Gobain Proposal undervalued the Company and that if Saint-Gobain wanted to pursue an
acquisition of the Company that the purchase price would need to be meaningfully increased. Mr. Feld also mentioned that there had been other strategic
interest in the Company.
On November 18 and 19, 2021, the management of the Company held a presentation for Party A in Atlanta, Georgia. During the management presentation,
the Company discussed its business, products, operations, financial performance and estimates, as well as potential opportunities for synergies for Party
A in a potential transaction. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Bates and chief executive officer of Party A, together with other members of senior
management of the Company and Party A, discussed next steps in the process and timing. Mr. Bates reiterated that the Board continued to have
confidence in the Company’s standalone business plan and had not determined to sell the Company, that the process approved by the Board was
targeted and exploratory only, and that Party A would need to submit a proposal at a price significantly above the First Party A Proposal for the Board to
move forward with further discussions.

On November 19, 2021, Mr. Bazin corresponded with both Mr. Bates and Mr. Feld to convey a revised offer from Saint-Gobain of $30.00 per share in cash.
Saint-Gobain then sent an updated non-binding written proposal to acquire the Company for $30.00 per share in cash (the “Second Saint-Gobain
Proposal”). The Second Saint-Gobain Proposal was subject to the completion of diligence and negotiation of definitive documents. The offer requested a
response by November 29, 2021, and was conditioned on the commitment to work on an expedited, bilateral and confidential basis, as well as receipt of
customary voting agreements from certain stockholders of the Company. Saint-Gobain indicated its ability to sign and announce within two weeks after
commencing substantive discussions. On November 19, 2021, the closing price of GCP Common Stock was $23.44 per share.
On November 22, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was held via teleconference, with the Company’s management and representatives of Latham in
attendance, during which the Board discussed the status of the proposals from Party A and Saint-Gobain. The Board also considered and discussed the
Management Projections (for details, see “—Certain Financial Projections”) with members of management and received presentations from
representatives of RBCCM (as a potential financial advisor at that time), which included preliminary financial analyses relating to the Company’s
standalone business strategy, and a presentation from representatives of another potential financial advisor to the Company, which included a review of
strategic and financial alternatives available to the Company, including continuing to pursue the Company’s standalone business strategy, seeking to
enhance return of capital to stockholders by using excess liquidity or incremental debt financing to fund either a special dividend or share buyback,
pursuing one or more meaningful acquisitions for cash and/or stock considerations, or a sale of the Company to strategic or financial sponsor parties.
The Board determined that, in light of the proposal received from Saint-Gobain and the expectation that a revised proposal would be received from Party
A shortly, as well as the opportunity to realize additional value in a competitive process between Party A and Saint-Gobain, the Company should continue
to explore a potential sale transaction with both Party A and Saint-Gobain. In this context, the Board determined it was not appropriate to grant exclusivity
to either Party A or Saint-Gobain.
On November 23, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates and shared that a revised offer would be submitted in writing later that day.
Shortly thereafter, the Company received a non-binding proposal for Party A to acquire the Company for $31.00 per share, which consisted of 50% cash
(representing $15.50 per share) and 50% of newly-issued shares of Party A’s publicly-traded common stock (representing 0.18 shares of Party A common
stock per share of GCP common stock), but with the option for the Company to receive $31.00 per share all in cash if preferable to the Board (the “Second
Party A Proposal”). The Second Party A Proposal was subject to the completion of diligence and negotiation of definitive documents. The Second Party
A Proposal indicated Party A’s desire to pursue customary financing, including externally sourced debt, but stated that the Second Party A Proposal was
not subject to a financing contingency. The Second Party A Proposal indicated a three to four week timeline to complete negotiations, diligence, and sign
and announce the transaction. On November 23, 2021, the closing price of GCP Common Stock was $23.07 per share.
On November 24, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was held via teleconference, together with management and representatives from RBCCM and
Latham. During the meeting, representatives from Latham reviewed the fiduciary obligations of the Board when considering potential strategic
transactions, including a potential sale transaction. Representatives from RBCCM provided the Board an update with respect to certain financial
analyses, as well as strategies to maximize stockholder value, and reviewed various potential deal processes. It was noted that Saint-Gobain and Party A
were highly qualified strategic bidders, with the opportunity to realize synergies in a potential transaction with the Company, and, taking into
consideration the strategic alternative process from the spring of 2019, that outreach to other potential strategic parties or financial sponsors (including
Party B) at that time was not expected to realize additional value for the Company and its stockholders. The Board reviewed the terms of the RBCCM
engagement and certain customary disclosures provided by RBCCM with respect to its relationships with the Company, Saint-Gobain and Party A, and
selected RBCCM as the Company’s financial advisor on the basis of, among other things, RBCCM’s reputation, experience, knowledge and familiarity
with the Company and its industry, and lack of material conflicts. The
40
Table of Contents
Board authorized Mr. Bates to work with Mr. Feld to finalize an engagement letter with RBCCM. With respect to the Second Saint-Gobain Proposal and
the Second Party A Proposal, the Board determined to move forward with both Party A and Saint-Gobain and authorized the Company’s management and
RBCCM to advise the bidders of a proposed process for due diligence and submission of revised proposals. The Board determined that it would not
grant exclusivity to either bidder at that time.
That evening, Mr. Bates called Mr. Bazin to inform him that the Second Saint-Gobain Proposal was no longer competitive and needed to be increased and
that the Board was not willing to grant exclusivity, but that the Board had authorized the Company to work with RBCCM towards obtaining final bids and
potentially sign definitive documents by the week of December 13, 2021. Mr. Bazin indicated that he would come back with a revised proposal after
completion of due diligence, but that the Company’s stated timeline was too long and that Saint-Gobain would be in a position to submit its final
proposal, sign definitive transaction documents and announce by Monday, December 6, 2021.
On November 26, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to explain that the Board had reviewed the Second Party A Proposal and had
determined to move forward with a competitive process, with the most important considerations for the Board being value, certainty, and speed. In
response to a question from Mr. Bates, Party A clarified that the implied value of the 50% cash and 50% of Party A common stock offer was intended to
be the same $31.00 per share as the all-cash offer. Mr. Bates shared that RBCCM and Latham had been hired as advisors to represent the Company, and
further discussed timing, due diligence, and next steps.
On November 28, 2021, Mr. Valente contacted Antoine Vignial, the Corporate Secretary of Saint-Gobain to discuss process and timing. Mr. Valente
indicated that additional materials would be provided in the virtual data room, with a merger agreement draft to be distributed on the same day. It was
noted that the regulatory teams of Latham and the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (“Freshfields”), outside legal counsel to Saint-Gobain, should
discuss competition and foreign investment filings.
That evening, representatives of Latham and Freshfields met telephonically to discuss process and timing, including the timing for distribution of a draft
merger agreement, the process for considering voting agreements requested by Saint-Gobain, due diligence and the process to confirm antitrust and
foreign investment filing requirements. Representatives of Freshfields indicated that Saint-Gobain wanted to sign by the end of the week. Representatives
of Latham noted that the process was competitive and that representatives of RBCCM had communicated expectations on process to representatives of
the financial advisors to Saint-Gobain.
On November 29, 2021, representatives of Latham met telephonically with the outside legal counsel to Party A to discuss process and timing, including
the timing for distribution of a draft merger agreement, the process for considering voting agreements requested by Party A, due diligence and the
process to confirm antitrust filing requirements. Party A’s legal counsel indicated that they understood the process could be moving forward on an
accelerated timeline. Latham explained that the process was moving quickly and that Party A should work as quickly as possible to remain competitive.
On the afternoon of November 29, 2021, Latham furnished the draft merger agreement to the legal representatives of each of Party A and Saint-Gobain.
The draft merger agreement provided for, among other things, cash consideration, customary non-solicitation and fiduciary out provisions, including the
ability for the Company to consider unsolicited competing proposals, customary information and access rights for the bidder, an initial three calendar day
match period (reduced to one calendar day for subsequent bids), the ability for the Company to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior
proposal, the ability for the Company to change its recommendation for an intervening event, a termination fee equal to 2% of transaction equity value, a
“hell or high water” antitrust covenant and no financing condition.
During the period leading up to December 3, 2021, the Company and its financial and legal advisors posted additional documents to the virtual data
rooms to which Party A and Saint-Gobain had access, held
41
Table of Contents
diligence calls and hosted facility visits with each of Party A and its financial, legal and other advisors, and Saint-Gobain and its financial, legal and other
advisors. The various diligence materials covered topics that included business, financial, commercial, tax, legal, compliance, human resources,
environmental, intellectual property and information technology issues.
On December 1, 2021, Mr. Bates had a telephone call with the chief executive officer of Party A, indicating that the Company expected to receive a revised,
higher cash offer from another bidder, that the other bidder was accelerating its process, had made considerable progress on its merger agreement, and
could be in a position to sign within 72 hours of its revised offer. Mr. Bates suggested that Party A provide the Company with crucial diligence requests
in order to support an increased offer from Party A, and asked if Party A was willing to increase its offer. The chief executive officer of Party A confirmed
that Party A had the ability to increase the Second Party A Proposal.
On December 1, 2021, Party A requested consent to furnish the Company’s name on a confidential basis to rating agencies as part of a process to arrange
potential debt financing. The Company promptly granted such consent. On December 1, 2021, an article was published on Bloomberg.com, an industry
news site that covers mergers and acquisitions, speculating that the Company was considering strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the
Company. The Company declined to comment on this article or subsequent market speculation, consistent with its corporate policy that it does not
comment on market rumors or speculation. On November 30, 2021, the last trading day prior to the article being published on the Bloomberg.com website,
the Company’s stock price closed at $23.34 per share.
In the evening on December 1, 2021, Freshfields sent a mark-up to the merger agreement to Latham together with proposed form voting agreements for
Starboard and Standard, respectively. Key changes to this revised merger agreement draft included an increased matching period of five business days
(reduced to three business days for subsequent proposals), a termination fee equal to 3.75% of transaction equity value, and an additional fee equal to
1% of transaction equity value payable if, among other things, the Company’s stockholders did not vote to approve the proposed transaction (also
known as a “naked no vote”). Saint-Gobain had agreed to the proposed “hell or high water” divestiture covenant. The voting agreement drafts were in
customary form and would terminate upon a termination of the merger agreement, but would not terminate if the Board otherwise changed its
recommendation without terminating the merger agreement.
On December 2, 2021, Mr. Bates and the chief executive officer of Party A exchanged emails reviewing critical due diligence items and providing feedback
regarding the completion of various diligence requests.
On December 2, 2021, Messrs. Bates and Valente had separate calls with Messrs. Bazin and Vignial of Saint-Gobain to discuss the timing and process of
the proposed transaction. Mr. Vignial subsequently indicated that Saint-Gobain had substantially completed its due diligence, the only remaining item
being the completion of the planned site visit on December 3, 2021. Later that day, Mr. Bazin called Mr. Bates to confirm that significant progress had
been made and indicated Saint-Gobain wanted to accelerate the process. Mr. Bazin separately confirmed to Mr. Feld that he spoke to Mr. Bates and
indicated that Saint-Gobain’s due diligence was substantially complete pending a last site visit for the next day, December 3, 2021. Mr. Bazin requested
that Latham and Freshfields work to revise the merger agreement and converge on finalized terms by the end of the day on December 3, 2021.
On the afternoon of December 2, 2021, representatives of Latham held a teleconference with legal counsel to Party A to discuss the status of the
applicable merger agreement draft, process and timing. Party A’s legal counsel indicated that an updated merger agreement draft would be sent later that
evening, but that Party A would not offer a “hell or high water” clause, but instead would offer a limited divestiture covenant subject to a cap, and a
reverse termination fee that would be equal to the Company’s termination fee. Party A’s legal counsel also asked whether there would be additional time
the following week to finalize the merger agreement.
42
Table of Contents
Representatives of Latham indicated that the process was competitive and moving quickly, and that Party A should make its best proposal relative to
antitrust commitments and financing as soon as possible to remain competitive.
Later that day, representatives of RBCCM held a teleconference with representatives of the financial advisor to Party A and communicated that the
process timeline was accelerating and that Party A should work quickly to increase value, shorten the timeline for signing definitive transaction
documents and provide additional certainty of consummation of a transaction.
Also on December 2, 2021, representatives of Latham held a teleconference with representatives of Freshfields to discuss the status of the merger
agreement draft, process and timing. Latham indicated that a revised draft of the merger agreement would be forthcoming on December 3, 2021, including
2.25% termination fee and a reduced matching period of three business days (reduced to two business days for subsequent proposals) and the
elimination of the “naked no vote” termination fee payable by the Company. In addition, Latham discussed the process for requesting a voting agreement
from Standard, noting that Standard was not under a non-disclosure agreement at that time, and therefore that GCP would plan to approach Standard to
sign a non-disclosure agreement closer to the signing of the merger agreement.
That evening, Party A’s legal counsel sent a mark-up to the draft merger agreement to Latham together with a proposed voting agreement for each of
Starboard and Standard. Updated terms included an increased matching period of three business days (reduced to two business days for subsequent
proposals). Party A agreed to a termination fee of 2% of the proposed equity value for the Company, but did not accept the “hell or high water”
divestiture covenant. Instead, Party A proposed it would have no obligation to divest assets that generate, in the aggregate, more than $30 million in total
revenues in the twelve months ended on December 31, 2020, as well as a reverse termination fee, payable if the transaction did not close due to failure to
obtain regulatory approvals, equal to 2% of the proposed equity value of the Company. Party A noted that its reverse termination fee should be equal to
the termination fee payable by the Company in connection with exercise of the fiduciary out provisions. The merger agreement would not be subject to a
financing condition, but Party A also added a covenant for the Company to cooperate to facilitate Party A’s third party debt financing. The voting
agreement drafts were in customary form and would terminate upon a termination of the merger agreement, but would not terminate if the Board otherwise
changed its recommendation without terminating the merger agreement.
That same evening, through email and telephonic communications, Mr. Vignial and Mr. Valente discussed the process for finalizing the merger agreement
and other transaction documents.
During the morning of December 3, 2021, the Board, along with the Company’s management and representatives of Latham and RBCCM, met via
videoconference and discussed the status of the ongoing negotiations, as well as process and anticipated timing. Mr. Bates indicated that he expected
Saint-Gobain to submit a revised offer on December 4, 2021. Latham reviewed the status of key legal work streams, and provided legal advice regarding
the revised drafts of the merger agreement submitted by Party A and Saint-Gobain. Latham also reviewed the proposed process for discussions with
Starboard and Standard regarding the proposed voting agreements, including the process to request that Standard enter into a customary non-disclosure
agreement with respect to those discussions. It was noted that Starboard was already subject to a non-disclosure agreement entered into in connection
with Mr. Feld’s service on the Board. Representatives of RBCCM reviewed and provided updates with respect to their discussions with Party A and
Saint-Gobain, including strategies to maintain competitive tension in the process, Saint-Gobain’s desire to sign as quickly as possible and how best to
elicit final proposals from each of Party A and Saint-Gobain to maximize value and certainty for the Company. The Board confirmed that it was not
prepared to grant either Party A or Saint-Gobain exclusivity, and that the Board would provide clear messages to each party to seek their final proposals.
The Board instructed management, Latham and RBCCM to notify Saint-Gobain and its advisors that Saint-Gobain would need to improve the value of its
offer significantly to remain competitive, but that the Company was willing to continue to move quickly if Saint-Gobain offered compelling value. The
Board also instructed management, Latham and
43
Table of Contents
RBCCM, to notify Party A that, in addition to increasing its offer price, Party A needed to accelerate timing of completing definitive transaction
documents and enhance the certainty of completing a proposed transaction, including by considering a “hell or high water” provision, and obtaining
committed debt financing. The Board instructed Latham to send revised draft merger agreements to the legal advisors for each of Party A and Saint-
Gobain. The Board authorized management to seek a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement with Standard to facilitate discussions of a voting
agreement between Standard and Saint-Gobain or Party A, as the case may be. In addition, the Board granted customary approvals, for purposes of
Section 203 of the DGCL, with respect to the voting agreements proposed to be entered into by Saint Gobain and Party A, respectively, with Starboard
and Standard such that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 would not apply by virtue of the voting agreements. The Board
concluded the meeting by authorizing RBCCM to use the Management Projections (for details, see “—Certain Financial Projections”), which were
previously reviewed by the Board, for purposes of its financial analysis and fairness opinion. Management confirmed the Management Projections
represented management’s best estimates as to the future financial performance of the Company at that time.
On December 3, 2021, Saint-Gobain submitted via email its final offer of $32.00 per share, in cash (the “Final Saint-Gobain Proposal”). This email was
followed by a letter from Saint-Gobain confirming the $32.00 per share, all-cash offer, and indicated that Saint-Gobain’s due diligence of the Company was
complete and that Saint-Gobain was prepared to sign the definitive documents. The proposal also indicated that it was subject to exclusive negotiations
with the Company, that the definitive agreement must be signed no later than the opening of the European financial markets on December 6, 2021 and that
the proposal represented Saint-Gobain’s best and final offer.
On December 3, 2021, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A to discuss process and timing, noting that the other bidder had revised its
offer and now constituted the highest offer for the Company, that the other bidder was moving quickly to signing and had offered a “hell or high water”
commitment with respect to antitrust and other regulatory approvals. Mr. Bates requested that Party A submit its final proposal by December 4, 2021,
increasing both value and certainty, as the Board was planning to meet on December 5, 2021 to review final proposals.
On December 3, 2021, representatives of Latham and Freshfields held a teleconference to discuss process and timing for the merger agreement, as well as
the process and timing for discussing voting agreements with Starboard and Standard. Separately, Mr. Valente and Mr. Vignial participated in a telephone
call with respect to process and timing, during which Mr. Vignial expressed Saint-Gobain’s desire to sign a definitive merger agreement quickly.
Also on December 3, 2021, Mr. Feld, management and representatives of Latham and RBCCM held a teleconference to discuss process and timing,
including how best to elicit a final proposal from Party A, in light of the Final Saint-Gobain Proposal and Saint-Gobain’s statement that a definitive
agreement must be signed no later than the opening of the European financial markets on December 6, 2021. The parties determined that management,
RBCCM and Latham should reiterate to Party A the request to provide a final proposal by the end of the day on December 4, 2021, to enable the Board to
consider final proposals during its anticipated meeting on December 5, 2021. Latham was instructed to send an updated merger agreement draft to Party
A’s legal advisor, and request that Party A’s legal advisor send a revised draft, reflecting any final comments from Party A, together with its final proposal
on December 4, 2021.
Later that day, representatives of Latham had a teleconference with Party A’s legal counsel to discuss process and timing, and provide feedback on key
issues in the merger agreement. Latham noted that a revised merger agreement would be distributed on the morning of December 4, 2021 and emphasized
the need for Party A to enhance certainty in its proposal by agreeing to a “hell or high water” provision or, if it were unable to offer such a provision, that
Party A submit its strongest commitments with respect to antitrust issues. Latham also indicated that the process was competitive and moving quickly
and that, to be competitive, Party A should be in a position to sign as soon as possible.

Also on December 3, 2021, Mr. Bates had a call with representatives of Standard to request that Standard enter into a customary non-disclosure
agreement to allow for discussions with the Company. The Company subsequently entered into a customary non-disclosure agreement with Standard.
Later that day, Mr. Feld and Mr. Bates called the Standard representatives to advise them of the proposed transactions with Saint-Gobain and Party A,
noting that Saint-Gobain’s proposal was currently more favorable, and conveyed the request for an agreement by Standard to vote for the proposed
transaction if Saint-Gobain emerged as the winner. Latham then distributed the voting agreement draft to the respective legal counsels for each of
Starboard and Standard.
During the evening of December 3, 2021, representatives of Latham and Freshfields participated in a teleconference to discuss issues related to the
merger agreement, including Saint-Gobain’s request for a termination fee of 3.75% of the proposed transaction equity value of the Company. Shortly
thereafter, Freshfields circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement to Latham and requested a call to finalize all open issues to be in a position to
sign as soon as possible. Latham responded that it would need to review the documents and consult with the Company, and then would be in a position
for a teleconference with Freshfields the next morning.
Also that evening, Mr. Vignial called Mr. Valente to discuss open issues with respect to the most recent revised merger agreement draft circulated from
Freshfields to Latham. Mr. Vignial proposed a termination fee of 3.00% of the proposed transaction equity value of the Company. Mr. Valente indicated
that the Company could be in a position to accept the 3.00% termination fee. From a process perspective, they agreed to instruct their respective legal
teams to work to finalize documents as soon as possible.
On the morning of December 4, 2021, Latham distributed draft disclosure schedules to the legal counsels for each of Party A and Saint-Gobain. Also on
the morning of December 4, 2021, Latham distributed a revised merger agreement draft to Party A’s legal counsel, requesting that Party A submit its final
proposed draft merger agreement by the end of the day on December 4, 2021 together with Party A’s final proposal.
Also on the morning of December 4, 2021, Mr. Bazin contacted both Mr. Feld and Mr. Bates to express Saint-Gobain’s desire to sign later in the day on
December 4, 2021. Mr. Feld then convened a call with management and representatives of Latham and RBCCM to discuss process and timing, including
the timing to obtain an improved offer from Party A in light of Saint-Gobain’s updated proposal and request to sign a definitive agreement by the evening
of December 4, 2021. Following this call, Mr. Feld called Mr. Bazin to inform him that the Board was planning to meet on December 5, 2021, that the
Company and its advisors would work quickly to finalize all definitive documents, and, if Saint-Gobain was selected as the buyer, that the Company was
working to be in a position to sign no later than the opening of the European financial markets on December 6, 2021, consistent with Saint-Gobain’s
previously communicated timeline. Mr. Feld stated that the Company would not be in a position to sign an agreement on December 4, 2021.
Thereafter, Mr. Bates called the chief executive officer of Party A, and representatives of RBCCM made a corresponding call to representatives of Party
A’s financial advisor, to reiterate that Party A should submit its updated proposal by on the end of the day on December 4, 2021, along with an updated
merger agreement draft, to remain competitive in the process. Mr. Bates and RBCCM emphasized the need for Party A to increase the value of its proposal
and the certainty of completion of a transaction, and provide a clear timeline for signing definitive transaction documents.
Later that day, Mr. Bazin contacted Mr. Feld to request that the merger agreement between Saint-Gobain and the Company be signed as soon as possible.
Mr. Bazin further requested an update regarding negotiations with Standard regarding its voting agreement. Mr. Feld indicated that Standard had verbally
communicated its support for a sale of the Company, and that the Company expected to receive Standard’s comments to the draft voting agreement later
that evening. Mr. Feld also informed Mr. Bazin that the Board would meet on the morning of December 5, 2021, and that the Company continued to work
to be in a position to sign no later than the opening of the European financial markets on December 6, 2021, consistent with Saint-Gobain’s previously
communicated timeline, if Saint-Gobain was selected as the buyer.

Later on December 4, 2021, Latham sent a revised merger agreement draft to Freshfields, together with comments to the voting agreement draft. The
parties subsequently exchanged further drafts of the merger agreement, along with a revised draft voting agreement. Latham forwarded the voting
agreement draft to the legal counsel for each of the two stockholders (Starboard and Standard) and requested that each be in a position to sign its
respective voting agreement.
On December 4, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A called Mr. Bates to present Party A’s final proposal of $32.00 per share, with 60% of the
consideration payable in cash and 40% payable with Party A common stock (the “Final Party A Proposal”), and that Party A would not agree to a “hell or
high water” provision. The chief executive officer of Party A said Party A was working to be in a position to sign definitive documents during the
following week. Mr. Bates requested a submission of the offer in writing. The chief executive officer of Party A stated that they could not provide an offer
in writing until December 5, 2021. Mr. Bates indicated that he would provide feedback after the Board meeting the next day.
On the morning of December 5, 2021, the Board convened to review the Final Party A Proposal and the Final Saint-Gobain Proposal. The Board discussed
that while each proposal attributed the same nominal value for the Company’s stock at $32.00 per share, the Final Party A Proposal consisted of 60% cash
and 40% stock and required third party debt financing, whereas the Final Saint-Gobain Proposal consisted of 100% cash and would be funded from cash
on hand at Saint-Gobain. The Board noted Party A would not agree to a “hell or high water” provision, and Party A would not be in a position to sign a
definitive agreement until the following week at the earliest. Representatives of Latham provided legal advice to the Board with respect to antitrust and
foreign investment filings, reviewed key terms of the draft merger agreement proposed by Saint-Gobain, and counseled the Board regarding its fiduciary
duties in the context of a potential sale of the Company. Representatives of RBCCM reviewed RBCCM’s financial analysis with respect to the Final Saint-
Gobain Proposal. After discussion, the Board expressed its view that the competitive process had yielded the best proposals from each party and, in light
of value and certainty represented by the Final Saint-Gobain Proposal and Saint-Gobain’s statement that it would not continue with discussions if the
transaction were not signed and announced prior to the opening of the European financial markets on December 6, 2021, the Company should work with
its advisors to finalize definitive documents with Saint-Gobain to be presented to the Board for approval later that day.
Throughout the day on December 5, 2021, representatives of Latham and Freshfields participated in a series of conference calls in order to finalize the
merger agreement and the disclosure schedules, and engaged in separate discussions with legal counsel to Starboard and Standard to finalize the voting
agreements requested by Saint-Gobain. In connection with these discussions, Saint-Gobain agreed that the voting agreements would terminate on a
change in recommendation by the Board.
On December 5, 2021, the chief executive officer of Party A sent an email to Mr. Bates withdrawing the Final Party A Proposal.
In the late afternoon of December 5, 2021, a special meeting of the Board was held via teleconference with its management and representatives of Latham
and RBCCM in attendance. The Board reviewed the final form of the definitive agreements relating to the merger with Saint-Gobain as presented by
representatives of Latham, including the Merger Agreement and the voting agreements. Representatives of RBCCM then reviewed RBCCM’s financial
analyses and rendered an oral opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 5, 2021, to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the
$32.00 per share consideration to be paid to the holders of GCP common stock pursuant to the Saint-Gobain merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. For more information about RBCCM’s opinion, see below under the section entitled “—Opinion of RBC Capital Markets,
LLC.” The Board considered various reasons to approve the Merger Agreement (see “—Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and
46
Table of Contents
Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 47), and certain countervailing factors. After discussions with the Company’s management and financial and
legal advisors, the Board unanimously:
●
approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the merger;
●
determined the terms of the Merger Agreement and the merger were fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders;
●
approved the voting agreements;
●
directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption; and
●
recommended adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders.
Also on December 5, 2021, Mr. Bates discussed certain retention matters for key employees with Saint-Gobain, including the Company’s desire to make
certain awards to key employees during the pre-closing period in connection with employee promotion and annual performance assessments and
retention. The parties mutually agreed to a retention bonus pool not to exceed $12,000,000 in the aggregate and that Mr. Bates and Mr. Bazin would
cooperate in good faith to finalize the recipients, terms, timing and amounts of such bonuses after the execution of the Merger Agreement.
During the evening of December 5, 2021, the Company and Saint-Gobain executed and released signatures for the Merger Agreement and each of
Starboard and Standard, as well as Saint-Gobain, executed and released signatures for the voting agreements.
On the morning of December 6, 2021, the Company and Saint-Gobain issued press releases announcing the merger.",42,55

Recommendation of Our Board of Directors
The Board, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and carefully reviewing and considering various factors described in “—
Reasons for the Merger,” unanimously (i) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; (ii) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, and the Voting Agreements are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, GCP and its stockholders; (iii) directed
that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of GCP for adoption at the special meeting; and (iv) recommended that GCP’s stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Board recommends that you vote: (i) “FOR” the Merger Proposal; (ii) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal; and (iii) “FOR” the Compensation
Proposal.
Reasons for the Merger
At a meeting of our Board on December 5, 2021, our Board unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; (ii) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, GCP and its stockholders; (iii) directed that the
Merger Agreement be submitted to GCP’s stockholders for adoption at the special meeting; and (iv) recommended that GCP’s stockholders adopt the
Merger Agreement.
In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by GCP’s
stockholders, the Board evaluated the Merger Agreement and the
47Table of Contents
Merger with GCP’s management and GCP’s legal and financial advisors and carefully considered a number of factors, including the following material
factors (which are not intended to be exhaustive or listed in any relative order of importance):
●
the fact that the Merger Consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 37% over the closing price of GCP common stock on
November 30, 2021, the last trading day before a media report was published speculating about a potential sale process, and (ii) a premium
of 39% over the 30-day volume-weighted average on the same date;
●
the Board’s belief that the value offered to stockholders pursuant to the Merger is more favorable to GCP stockholders than the potential
value from other alternatives reasonably available to GCP, including remaining an independent public company, after reviewing GCP’s
business, financial condition, results of operations, market trends, competitive landscape and execution risks, and discussions with GCP’s
management and advisors and considering:
●
the outlook for the industries and end markets that GCP serves;
●
the historical, current and prospective financial condition, results of operations and business of GCP and the execution risks and
uncertainties associated with achieving GCP’s stand-alone plan, including GCP’s ability to attract and retain talent, GCP’s ability to
compete effectively and growth given its relatively smaller scale in its geographies outside North America, and GCP’s history of
management changes and the restructuring and relocation of its corporate headquarters to Alpharetta, Georgia;
●
the increasingly competitive nature of GCP’s industry; and
●
the risks and uncertainties of continuing on a stand-alone basis as an independent public company.
●
the fact that the Merger Consideration of $32.00 per share will be paid in cash, and provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to
GCP’s stockholders, enabling them to realize value for their interest in GCP while eliminating business and execution risk inherent in GCP’s
business, including risks and uncertainties associated with achievement of the stand-alone plan;
●
the Board’s belief that the competitive bidding process between Saint-Gobain and Party A, both highly credible strategic bidders,
positioned GCP and its advisors to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for the proposed Merger in the interests of GCP and its
stockholders;
●
the belief of the Board, based upon arms’ length negotiations, including the Board’s multiple requests that Parent increase its proposed
price per share and its responses thereto (as further described in the section titled “—Background of the Merger” on page 34 of this proxy
statement), resulting in Parent’s submission of what Parent referred to as its “best and final” offer, that the price to be paid by Parent was
the highest price per share that Parent was willing to pay for GCP;
●
the fact that the Merger Agreement was the product of arms’ length negotiations and contained terms and conditions that are, in the
Board’s view, advisable and favorable to GCP and its stockholders, as well as the Board’s belief, based on these negotiations, that these
are the most favorable terms available to GCP and its stockholders on which Parent was willing to transact;
●
the business reputation, financial wherewithal and capabilities of Saint-Gobain, including its prior track record of successfully completing
acquisitions;
●
the Board’s belief that Parent has access to the resources needed to complete the Merger, based on, among other factors, Saint-Gobain’s
guarantee of the performance and payment in full of all obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement;
●
the financial analysis presented by RBCCM and the oral opinion of RBCCM, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion, dated December 5, 2021, to the Board, a copy of which is
48
Table of Contents
attached to this proxy statement as Appendix C, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based on and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of
view, to holders of GCP common stock, as more fully described below in the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of RBC Capital
Markets, LLC”;
●
the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, based upon, among other things, the limited number of conditions to the Merger,
Parent’s ability to pay the Merger Consideration in cash, without the requirement for third party debt financing, the likelihood of obtaining
required regulatory approvals and contractual commitments by Parent and Merger Sub to use their best efforts (including, if necessary,
through litigation or the sale, divestiture or disposition of assets) to obtain regulatory approval for the Merger under applicable
competition laws; and
●
the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the following related factors:
●
the customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of GCP in the Merger Agreement;
●
the ability of the Board, subject to certain limitations, to respond to a bona fide written acquisition proposal received from a third
party following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to obtaining the stockholder approval if the Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the acquisition proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal;
●
the ability of the Board, subject to certain limitations, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that stockholders vote in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement in connection with the receipt of a superior proposal or the occurrence of an intervening event,
and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
superior proposal, subject to payment to Parent of a termination fee;
●
the conclusion of the Board that the termination fee and the circumstances in which such termination fee may be payable are
reasonable in light of the benefit of the Merger and would not be a significant impediment to third parties interested in making an
acquisition proposal;
●
the fact that Parent has agreed to use its best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals, including, if necessary, through litigation or the
sale, divestiture or disposition of assets to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable competition
and foreign investment law;
●
Parent’s ability to pay the Merger Consideration in cash, without the requirement for third party debt financing;
●
the fact that Saint-Gobain has guaranteed the performance and payment in full of all obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement;
●
the fact that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, GCP is entitled to specific performance and other equitable remedies to prevent
breaches of the Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, may enforce Parent’s obligation to consummate the
transactions, including the Merger, contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
●
the fact that the Outside Date (as it may be extended) under the Merger Agreement allows for sufficient time to complete the
Merger; and
●
the availability of statutory appraisal rights to GCP stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL.
49
Table of Contents
The Board also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors with respect to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the
following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):
●
the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on our soliciting competing bids to acquire GCP following the date of the Merger Agreement;
●
the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on GCP’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement or change its recommendation in connection
with the receipt of a superior proposal, including the fact that the Board must (i) provide three business days’ written notice to Parent of
its intention to effect a change of board recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in order to provide Parent with an
opportunity to match a superior proposal; (ii) negotiate in good faith with Parent during such period, and the discouraging effect such
restrictions may have on other potential bidders; and (iii) consider in good faith any adjustments and/or proposed amendments to the
Merger Agreement (including a change to the price terms thereof) and other agreements contemplated thereby that were irrevocably
proposed in writing by Parent no later than 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the last day of such three business day notice period;
●
the fact that, under certain circumstances in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement (including if the Board changes its
recommendation in light of a superior proposal or intervening event or if GCP terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior
proposal), GCP will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $71.0 million, and the potential effect of such termination fee to
discourage other potential bidders from making an acquisition proposal for GCP;
●
the fact that, if the Merger is completed, GCP stockholders would not have the opportunity to participate in the future performance of our
assets, earnings growth and appreciation of the value of GCP common stock;
●
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the Merger and the substantial time and effort of
management required to complete the Merger and related disruptions to the operation of our business;
●
the risk that the conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be satisfied and, as a result, the possibility that the Merger may
not be completed in a timely manner or at all, even if the Merger Agreement is adopted by GCP’s stockholders;
●
the potential negative effects if the Merger is not consummated, including:
●
the trading price of GCP common stock could be adversely affected;
●
we will have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs attempting to complete the Merger;
●
we could lose customers, suppliers, business partners and employees, including key executives, sales and other personnel;
●
our business may be subject to significant disruption and decline;
●
the market’s perceptions of our prospects could be adversely affected; and
●
our directors, officers and other employees will have expended considerable time and efforts to consummate the Merger;
●
the fact that any gain realized by GCP stockholders as a result of the Merger will generally be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes
to those stockholders that are U.S. persons subject to taxation in the United States;
●
the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which may delay or
prevent us from undertaking business or other opportunities that may arise prior to completion of the Merger;
50
Table of Contents
●
the potential distraction to our business from stockholder lawsuits in connection with the Merger; and
●
the fact that our executive officers and directors may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of
GCP stockholders. See “—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger” on page 60 of this proxy statement.
After taking into account the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger to GCP’s
stockholders outweighed the potentially negative factors associated with the Merger. Accordingly, the Board unanimously determined that the Merger
Agreement and the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of GCP and its stockholders and recommends that the stockholders of GCP
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing discussion summarizes the material factors considered by the Board, but is not intended to be exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Moreover, each member of the Board applied his or her
own business judgment to the process and may have given different weight to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination and
recommendation. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including its discussions with GCP’s executive
management and its financial advisors and outside legal counsel. This explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in
this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking
Statements” on page 30 of this proxy statement.",55,59

On December 5, 2021, RBCCM rendered an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated December 5, 2021, to
the Board to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set
forth therein, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of GCP common stock. The full text of RBCCM’s written opinion
dated December 5, 2021, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix C and constitutes part of this proxy statement. RBCCM’s opinion was approved
by RBCCM’s Fairness Opinion Committee. This summary of RBCCM’s opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. GCP
urges holders of GCP common stock to read RBCCM’s opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by RBCCM.
RBCCM’s advice (written or oral) and opinion were provided for the benefit, information and assistance of the Board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its evaluation of the Merger. RBCCM’s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of GCP to engage in the Merger or
the relative merits of the Merger compared to any alternative business strategy or transaction that may be available to GCP or in which GCP might
engage. RBCCM’s opinion does not constitute an opinion or recommendation to any holder of GCP common stock as to how such holder should vote or
act with respect to the Merger or any proposal to be voted upon in connection with the Merger or otherwise.
RBCCM’s opinion addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date thereof, of the Merger Consideration (to the extent expressly
specified therein), without regard to individual circumstances of specific holders that may distinguish such holders or the securities of GCP held by such
holders. RBCCM’s opinion did not in any way address any other terms, conditions, implications or other aspects of the Merger or the Merger Agreement,
including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any voting agreements to be entered into by certain holders of GCP common stock in
favor of Parent in connection with the Merger, or any
51Table of Contents
other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or contemplated by the Merger or otherwise. RBCCM did not express any
opinion or view with respect to, and relied upon the assessments of GCP and its representatives regarding, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and similar
matters, as to which RBCCM understood that GCP obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In rendering its opinion,
RBCCM did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation (if any) or other
consideration to any officers, directors or employees of any party, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. In
connection with its engagement, RBCCM was not requested to, and did not, undertake a third-party solicitation process on GCP’s behalf with respect to
the acquisition of all or a part of GCP.
In rendering its opinion, RBCCM assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all information that was reviewed by RBCCM, including all
financial, legal, tax, accounting, operating and other information provided to, or discussed with RBCCM by, or on behalf of, GCP (including, without
limitation, financial statements and related notes), and upon the assurances of the GCP’s management and other representatives of GCP that they were
not aware of any information that had been omitted or that remained undisclosed to RBCCM that would have been meaningful in any material respects to
RBCCM’s analyses or opinion. RBCCM did not assume responsibility for independently verifying and did not independently verify such information.
RBCCM also assumed that the financial projections and other estimates and data that it was directed to utilize in its analyses were reasonably prepared
on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of GCP’s management as to the future financial performance of GCP
and the other matters covered thereby and RBCCM further assumed that the financial results reflected therein will be realized in the amounts and at the
times projected. RBCCM expressed no opinion as to any such financial projections and other estimates and data or the assumptions upon which they
were based. RBCCM assumed that there will be no developments with respect to any of the foregoing that would have an adverse effect on GCP or the
Merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in any material respect to its analyses or opinion.
In connection with its opinion, RBCCM did not assume any responsibility to perform, and did not perform, an independent valuation or appraisal of any
of the assets or liabilities (contingent, off-balance sheet, accrued, derivative or otherwise) of or relating to GCP or any other entity and RBCCM was not
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. RBCCM did not assume any obligation to conduct, and did not conduct, any physical inspection of the
property or facilities of GCP or any other entity. RBCCM did not investigate, and made no assumption regarding, any litigation or other claims affecting
GCP or any other entity. RBCCM did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of GCP or any other entity under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. RBCCM assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement
and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition
or agreement, and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents, releases, waivers and
agreements for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed or occur, including any divestiture or other requirements, that
would have an adverse effect on GCP or the Merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in any material respect to its analyses or opinion. In addition,
RBCCM assumed that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ, in any material respect that would be meaningful to its analyses or opinion,
from the draft that it reviewed.
RBCCM’s opinion speaks only as of the date thereof, is based on the conditions as they existed and information supplied or reviewed as of the date
thereof, and is without regard to any market, economic, financial, legal or other circumstances or event of any kind or nature which may exist or occur or
may have existed or occurred after such date. RBCCM did not undertake any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion for events occurring after
the date thereof. As the Board was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets, and the industries in which GCP operates, have experienced and
continue to experience volatility and RBCCM expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on GCP (or its business) or the
Merger.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, RBCCM undertook such review, inquiries and analyses as it deemed necessary or appropriate under the
circumstances, including the following:
●
RBCCM reviewed the financial terms of a draft of the Merger Agreement;
●
RBCCM reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information, and certain historical operating data, relating to GCP made
available to it from published sources and internal records of GCP;
●
RBCCM reviewed the Management Projections (as defined below under “—Certain Financial Projections”) and other estimates and data
relating to GCP, prepared by GCP’s management, which projections and other estimates and data RBCCM was directed to utilize for
purposes of its analyses and opinion;
●
RBCCM conducted discussions with members of the senior management of GCP relating to the business, prospects and financial outlook
of GCP;
●
RBCCM reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for GCP common stock;
●
RBCCM compared certain financial metrics of GCP with those of selected publicly traded companies in lines of businesses that it
considered generally relevant in evaluating GCP;
●
RBCCM compared certain financial terms of the Merger with those of selected precedent transactions that it considered generally relevant

●
RBCCM considered other information and performed other studies and analyses as it deemed appropriate.
Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by RBCCM in connection with rendering its opinion, as delivered to the Board
in connection with its meeting on December 5, 2021. The order of analyses described does not represent relative importance or weight given to those
analyses by RBCCM. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. To fully understand the summary
of the analyses used by RBCCM, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the analysis.
For purposes of its analyses, RBCCM reviewed a number of financial and operating metrics, using certain time periods, including:
●
“Enterprise Value”—the value as of a specified date of the relevant company’s outstanding equity securities (taking into account
outstanding in-the-money options and other in-the-money securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into or for equity securities
of the company), plus the amounts of its net debt (the amount of its outstanding indebtedness and out-of-the-money convertible and
non-convertible preferred stock, less the amount of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet) and non-controlling interests, less the
amount of investments in unconsolidated affiliates; and
●
“EBITDA”—the amount of the relevant company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for a specified time
period.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the analyses performed below were calculated using (i) the closing prices of (a) GCP common stock as of
November 30, 2021, the day prior to press reports of the potential acquisition of GCP (the “GCP Unaffected Stock Price”) and (b) the common equity of the
selected U.S. public companies in the specialty and envelope building products (“S&E Building Products”) and construction chemicals (“Construction
Chemicals”) sectors as of December 3, 2021 and (ii) historical balance sheet data for the selected companies and GCP based on publicly available
information for each company as of December 3, 2021. Per share amounts for GCP were based on diluted shares outstanding calculated using the treasury
stock method and GCP’s securities outstanding as of December 2, 2021, as set forth in a draft of the Merger Agreement. Implied equity value per share
reference ranges for GCP described below were rounded to the nearest $0.25.

Table of Contents
Selected Companies Analysis. RBCCM reviewed certain financial and operating information and implied trading multiples for selected publicly traded
companies in the S&E Building Products and Construction Chemicals sectors as compared to the corresponding information and implied trading multiples
for GCP. The relevant publicly traded companies were selected based upon RBCCM’s professional judgment and experience as to companies with
operational and financial characteristics similar to those of GCP. In this analysis, RBCCM compared, among other things, multiples of implied Enterprise
Value to estimates of EBITDA for each of calendar years 2021 (“2021E”) and 2022 (“2022E”), which estimates for the selected companies and GCP were
based on mean consensus Wall Street analyst estimates (such mean consensus estimates, “Wall Street research”), available as of December 3, 2021.

Based on the foregoing, RBCCM selected Enterprise Value reference range multiples of 13.0x—17.0x 2021E EBITDA and 11.5x—14.5x 2022E EBITDA.
RBCCM applied such multiple ranges to 2021E Adjusted EBITDA (as such term is described below under “—Certain Financial Projections”) and 2022E
Adjusted EBITDA for GCP (based on the Management Projections), in order to derive implied Enterprise Value reference ranges. RBCCM then derived
implied equity value per share reference ranges using the balance sheet and diluted share information described above. This analysis indicated the
following implied equity value per share reference ranges for GCP common stock as compared to the GCP Unaffected Stock Price and the Merger
Consideration:
Implied Equity Value Per Share Reference Range

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. RBCCM reviewed certain implied transaction multiples for seventeen (17) transactions involving target
companies in the S&E Building Products and Construction Chemicals sectors since the beginning of 2017. The relevant precedent transactions were
selected based upon RBCCM’s professional judgment and experience as to target companies with operational and financial characteristics similar to
those of GCP. Financial and operating data for each target company in the selected transactions were calculated as of the announcement date of the
applicable transaction based, in part, on the implied purchase prices announced on such date for the selected transactions, and otherwise based on
publicly

available information for each target company as of the most recent quarter prior to the announcement of the applicable transaction for which such
information was available or as otherwise subsequently publicly disclosed by the applicable transaction parties. Accordingly, this information may not
reflect current or future market conditions.
In this analysis, RBCCM compared, among other things, multiples of implied Enterprise Value to the EBITDA of the target company for the latest twelve
month period (“LTM”) for which financial information had been publicly announced prior to the announcement of the applicable transaction. The results
of this analysis are summarized in the following table:

Based on the foregoing, RBCCM selected Enterprise Value reference range multiples of 12.0x—15.0x LTM EBITDA. RBCCM applied such multiple range
to 2021E Adjusted EBITDA for GCP (based on the Management Projections), in order to derive an implied Enterprise Value reference range. RBCCM then
derived an implied equity value per share reference range using the balance sheet and diluted share information described above. This analysis indicated
the following implied equity value per share reference range for GCP common stock as compared to the GCP Unaffected Stock Price and the Merger

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. RBCCM performed a discounted cash flow analysis of GCP by calculating the estimated net present value of the after-
tax free cash flows of GCP as of December 31, 2021, based on the Management Projections.
RBCCM performed the discounted cash flow analysis using (i) discount rates ranging from 10.5%—12.5% based on an estimated weighted average cost
of capital of GCP, using the capital asset pricing model and (ii) a terminal value at the end of the forecast period, using terminal multiples ranging from
11.0x—13.0x estimated calendar year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, which estimated Adjusted EBITDA was the terminal year Adjusted EBITDA for GCP (based
on the Management Projections), in order to derive an implied Enterprise Value reference range. RBCCM then derived an implied equity value per share
reference range using estimated net debt and non-controlling interests as of December 31, 2021 and diluted share information described above. The
discounted cash flow analysis indicated the following implied equity value per share reference range for GCP common stock as compared to the GCP

Overview of Analyses; Other Considerations
No single company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison was identical to GCP or the Merger, and an evaluation of the results of
those analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involved complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions analyzed.
56
Table of Contents
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves the application of subjective business judgment in determining the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to particular circumstances. Several analytical methodologies
were used by RBCCM, and no one method of analysis should be regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached. Each analytical technique has
inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature of the available information may further affect the value of particular techniques. The overall
conclusions of RBCCM were based on all the analyses and factors presented herein taken as a whole and also on application of RBCCM’s own
experience and judgment. Such conclusions may involve significant elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. RBCCM therefore believes
that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the analyses and the factors considered, without considering all factors
and analyses, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the processes underlying its opinion.
RBCCM, as part of its investment banking services, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, corporate restructurings, underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
corporate and other purposes. RBCCM was selected to advise GCP with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and
its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with GCP and the industries in which it operates. In the ordinary
course of business, RBCCM and/or certain of its affiliates may act as a market maker and broker in the publicly traded securities of GCP, Saint-Gobain
and/or other entities involved in the Merger, or their respective affiliates, and receive customary compensation in connection therewith, and may also
actively trade securities of GCP, Saint-Gobain and/or other entities involved in the Merger, or their respective affiliates, for its or its affiliates’ own account
or for the account of customers and, accordingly, RBCCM and its affiliates may hold a long or short position in such securities. RBCCM and certain of its
affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing or in the future may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and financial advisory
services to GCP, Saint-Gobain and certain of their respective affiliates unrelated to the Merger, including having acted as a lender under certain credit
facilities of Saint-Gobain and its affiliates, for which services RBCCM and its affiliates have received and expect to receive customary compensation.
Aggregate fees received by RBCCM and its affiliates for all investment banking, commercial banking and financial advisory services, since November 1,
2019, from Saint-Gobain and certain of its affiliates is less than $1.5 million.
Under its engagement agreement with GCP, RBCCM became entitled to a fee of $1.0 million upon the delivery of its opinion in connection with the Merger,
without regard to whether such opinion was accepted or the Merger is consummated. If GCP consummates the Merger, RBCCM will receive an additional
transaction fee currently estimated to be approximately $13.5 million paid upon the closing of the Merger, against which the fee RBCCM received for
delivery of its opinion will be credited. GCP has also agreed to indemnify RBCCM for certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement, and to
reimburse certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by RBCCM in performing its services. The terms of RBCCM’s engagement letter were negotiated at
arm’s-length between GCP and RBCCM, and the Board was aware of this fee arrangement at the time it reviewed and approved the Merger Agreement.",59,65
GCP Applied Technologies Inc._20220131_DEFM14A_19806508_4372223.Pdf,Certain Financial Projections,"Certain Financial Projections
GCP does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose internal projections of its future financial performance, revenue, earnings, EBITDA, financial
condition or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. In connection with GCP’s
evaluation of a possible transaction, GCP management prepared certain non-public, unaudited, stand-alone financial projections (the “Management
Projections”). The Management Projections were furnished to the Board and reviewed by the Board at its meetings held on November 1, 2021, November
22, 2021 and December 3, 2021, in connection with the Board’s review of the proposed transaction with Saint-Gobain, and at its meeting held on December
3, 2021, the Board authorized GCP’s financial advisor to use the Management Projections for purposes of performing its financial analyses summarized
under “—Opinion of RBC Capital Markets, LLC” on page 51 of this proxy
57Table of Contents
statement. The Management Projections reflect the following key considerations and assumptions as to the future financial performance of GCP:
●
financial results and business performance for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2021;
●
the outlook for the industries and markets that GCP serves and the increased competitive environment, particularly as it relates to growth
in global construction; and
●
GCP’s estimated share in its Specialty Construction Chemicals (including VERIFI®) segment and Specialty Building Materials segment, as
well as pricing, productivity and inflation trends.
The Management Projections are included in the table below. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that GCP, its
financial advisors or any of their respective representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Management
Projections to be necessarily predictive of future results. GCP’s management advised the Board that the Management Projections represent GCP’s
management’s best estimates of the future financial performance of GCP and its business as currently configured as a stand-alone publicly listed
company.
The following table summarizes the Management Projections as described above.

Adjusted EBIT is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders adjusted for: (i) gains and losses on
sales of businesses, product lines and certain other investments; (ii) currency and other financial losses in Venezuela; (iii) costs related to legacy
product, environmental and other claims; (iv) restructuring and repositioning expenses, and asset write offs; (v) defined benefit plan costs other
than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs/credits; (vi) third-party and other
acquisition-related costs; (vii) other financing costs associated with the modification or extinguishment of debt; (viii) amortization of acquired
inventory fair value adjustments; (ix) tax indemnification adjustments; (x) interest income, interest expense and related financing costs; (xi) income
taxes; (xii) shareholder activism and other related costs; (xiii) gain on sale of corporate headquarters, net of related costs; and (xiv) certain other
items that are not representative of underlying trends.
(2)
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.
(3)
Unlevered Free Cash Flow was calculated by RBCCM, for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as tax-adjusted EBIT plus depreciation
and amortization less capital expenditures and change in net working capital based, in each case, on assumptions provided by GCP management.
The Management Projections also were provided to Saint-Gobain and Party A in connection with their respective due diligence reviews of GCP and the
proposed transaction, except that, for fiscal year 2021, the projections provided to Saint-Gobain and Party A were adjusted to account for out-of-period
impacts and supply chain disruption on revenues. After giving effect to these adjustments, the financial projections provided to Saint-Gobain and Party
A showed, for fiscal year 2021 (in millions), Net Revenue of $965, Adjusted Gross Profit of $347, Adjusted EBIT of $93 and Adjusted EBITDA of $139.
Unlevered Free Cash Flow calculated by RBCCM was not provided to Saint-Gobain and Party A.
58Table of Contents
GCP’s ability to achieve the results set forth in the Management Projections are expressly dependent upon certain assumptions, including with respect to
broad trends in the construction chemicals and building materials industries and the continued impact of pandemic restrictions, cost inflation and supply
chain disruptions. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included herein only because such
information was made available as described above. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to comply with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information.
Furthermore, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accountant, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied
procedures to the Management Projections and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for them and expresses no opinion on them. The Management
Projections included herein have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, GCP’s management.
Although a summary of the Management Projections is presented with numerical specificity, the Management Projections reflect numerous variables,
assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the Management
Projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to the Company’s management at the time the Management Projections
were prepared. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important
factors that may cause actual results to deviate from the Management Projections include general economic conditions, results or financial condition,
industry performance, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, the continued
impact of pandemic restrictions, cost inflation and supply chain disruptions, accuracy of certain industry forecasts prepared by third parties,
strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting our results, our contingent liabilities and tax matters
causing us to incur losses or costs, any inability to protect our intellectual property rights adversely affecting our business or our competitive position,
costs or adverse effects on our business, reputation or results from governmental regulations, failure to hire and retain employees, results or financial
condition, and changes in tax laws. In addition, the Management Projections do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that
the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Management Projections.
Since the Management Projections cover multiple years, that information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The inclusion
of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, GCP, our financial advisor or Saint-Gobain, or any of their respective
representatives and affiliates, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Management Projections to be material
information of GCP or that actual future results will necessarily reflect the Management Projections, and the Management Projections should not be relied
upon as such. The summary of the Management Projections is not included herein to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or
any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the
Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to shares of GCP common stock.
The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements, risk factors and other information
regarding GCP contained in our public filings with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 119 of this proxy statement.
The Management Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause GCP’s future results to materially vary, see
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” on page 30 of this proxy statement.
Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility, to update or otherwise
revise the Management Projections to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic or industry conditions, even if the
assumptions underlying the Management Projections are shown to be in error. By including in this proxy statement a summary of certain
59
Table of Contents
financial projections, neither GCP nor any of its representatives or advisors, nor Saint-Gobain or any of its representatives and affiliates, makes any
representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of GCP compared to the information contained in such financial projections and should
not be read to do so.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to unduly rely on the
Management Projections included herein.
Certain of the measures included in the Management Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP financial
measures as used by GCP may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that certain of our directors and
executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder generally. The Board was
aware of these interests in, among other matters, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be
adopted by the stockholders of GCP. See “—Background of the Merger” and “—Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the
Merger” on pages 34 and 47 of this proxy statement, respectively. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the
approval of the Merger Agreement.
These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them, including the compensation that may become payable in connection with the
Merger to Messrs. Bates, Merrill, Holland, Thompson, and Van Lent, who constitute our named executive officers, are subject to a non-binding, advisory
vote of the stockholders of GCP and are quantified in the narrative below and in “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer
Compensation” on page 112 of this proxy statement. Messrs. Holland, Thompson and Van Lent are no longer employed by the Company. The dates used
below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will
occur.
Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards
Under the Merger Agreement, the equity-based awards held by GCP’s directors and executive officers under the GCP Applied Technologies Inc. Equity
and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on July 29, 2020 (the “Equity and Incentive Plan”) and the GCP Applied Technologies Inc. 2020 Inducement
Plan (the “Inducement Plan”) will be treated as follows:
Company Options
At the Effective Time, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically
and without any required action on the part of the holder or GCP be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in
cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of GCP common stock underlying the Company Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Option; provided, that any such Company Option with respect to which the exercise
price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company Restricted Stock and each outstanding award of Company RSUs that in each case at such
time is vested (including restricted stock units under the Company’s Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred Compensation Program) or subject solely to
service-based vesting conditions shall be fully vested and shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the
Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal
60Table of Contents
to (x) the total number of shares of GCP common stock underlying such award of Company Restricted Stock or Company RSUs, as applicable, multiplied
by (y) the Merger Consideration.
Performance Based Stock Units
At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company PBUs that at such time is subject to performance-based vesting conditions shall become
vested as to the greater of the number of Shares subject to such Company PBUs that would vest based on (1) the target level of achievement and (2) the
Company’s actual level of achievement of the performance goals set forth in the applicable award agreement as of the Effective Time, as determined by
the Board or its Compensation Committee prior to the completion of the Merger, and shall, after giving effect to such vesting, automatically and without
any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount
in cash equal to (x) the number of vested Shares underlying such Company PBUs, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. Any outstanding
Company PBUs (or portion thereof) that are not vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled for no consideration.
The following table sets forth the number of outstanding Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PBUs that were awarded to and held by our
executive officers and non-employee directors as of the Record Date under our Equity and Incentive Plan and Inducement Plan and the value of these
awards in the Merger. The foregoing equity awards will be treated in the same manner as outstanding equity awards generally and described above. In
addition, any vested shares of GCP common stock held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of
GCP common stock held by other GCP stockholders entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.
As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 23, 2021, Messrs. Bates and Merrill each received accelerated payment in 2021 of
earned annual bonuses for fiscal year 2021 and accelerated vesting of certain equity awards to take advantage of tax planning opportunities that the
Company believes could benefit both the Company and the executives.

Other than the Bates Inducement Option (as defined below in footnote 6), options generally vest ratably over three years, with one-third of the
option vesting on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. All outstanding options have a 10 year term, except for the Bates
Inducement Option, which has a five year term. Stock options with an exercise price in excess of the Merger Consideration are excluded.
(2)
The value of each Company option is based on the Merger Consideration less the exercise price of the option. The value of each PBU and RSU is
based on the Merger Consideration.
(3)
Consists of Company RSUs granted pursuant to our Equity and Incentive Plan. The amounts reported primarily include Company RSUs which vest
over a three year period. Certain Company RSUs were designated as sign-on awards used for purposes of attracting key employees, the majority of
which vest after two years from the date of grant. With respect to non-employee directors, represents retainer fees paid in the form of Company
RSUs, under our Non-Employee Directors’ Deferred Compensation Program.
(4)
Consists of Company PBUs granted pursuant to our Equity and Incentive Plan. The amounts reported include Company PBU awards granted with
performance conditions and either with or without market-based vesting conditions. The performance criteria for PBUs granted in 2021 are tied to
the Company’s achievement of each of the following metrics: free cash flow, adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
metric, and relative total shareholder return, with each metric measured over a two year period. The performance criteria for PBUs granted in 2020
and 2019 are tied to the Company’s achievement of adjusted diluted earnings per share and relative total shareholder return, measured over a three
year period. PBUs granted in 2019 have been excluded from the table as the Company expects the performance criteria for these awards will not be
attained and they will be forfeited in accordance with their terms prior to the closing of the Merger.
(5)
In the case of Company PBUs, the amount reported assumes payout based on the target level of achievement as set forth in the applicable award
agreement. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding award of Company PBUs that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions
will become vested as to the greater of the number of shares subject to such Company PBUs that would vest based on (x) the target level of
achievement and (y) the Company’s actual level of achievement.
(6)
Represents award of an option to purchase 388,348 shares of GCP common stock issued to Mr. Bates under the Inducement Plan in connection with
the start of his employment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the “Bates Inducement Option”). The Bates Inducement Option is subject
to time- and performance-based vesting terms, with performance tied to achievement of pre-determined GCP stock price hurdles. At the effective
time of the Merger, all Company Options, including the Bates Inducement Option, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration described above.

Employment Agreement with Mr. Bates
In connection with the commencement of his employment, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Bates, dated October 1, 2020
(the “Bates Employment Agreement”). The Bates Employment Agreement sets forth, among other things, Mr. Bates’ initial annual base salary and target
bonus, the terms of his
62
Table of Contents
new hire equity awards (consisting of Company Restricted Stock and the Bates Inducement Option, each granted in October 2020) and his entitlement to
severance benefits upon certain terminations of employment. Mr. Bates’ new hire award of Company Restricted Stock provides for full vesting upon a
change in control and, in the event of a change in control, the time-based vesting conditions of the Bates Inducement Option will be deemed to be
satisfied; provided, that he remains employed through the date of a change in control. In addition, pursuant to its terms, the applicable portion of the
shares underlying the Bates Inducement Option will vest upon a change in control if the per-share price to be paid in the change in control equals or
exceeds the applicable share price target. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all Company Options including the Bates Inducement
Option, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration described above.
In the event of the involuntary termination of Mr. Bates’ employment by the Company without cause or by Mr. Bates for good reason, in each case
outside of the Change in Control Period (as defined below), subject to his execution of a separation agreement, including a release of claims, Mr. Bates
will receive (i) a severance payment equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary, (ii) the annual incentive compensation Mr. Bates would
otherwise be entitled to receive based on Company and individual performance for such calendar year and (iii) a pro-rata portion of the annual incentive
compensation Mr. Bates would otherwise be entitled to receive for such calendar year based on Company and individual performance.
If Mr. Bates is terminated as a result of death or disability, any equity awards subject solely to time-based vesting will become fully vested as of his
applicable date of termination, and any equity awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions will remain eligible to be earned at the end of the
applicable performance period based upon achievement of the pre-established performance metrics in accordance with the terms of the applicable award
agreements and equity incentive plan of the Company. Any portion of such performance-based awards that is earned at the end of the performance
period shall be immediately fully vested.
In the event of the involuntary termination of Mr. Bates’ employment by the Company without cause or by Mr. Bates for good reason, in each case within
12 months following a Change in Control of the Company (the “Change in Control Period”), subject to the execution of a separation agreement, including
a release of claims, Mr. Bates will receive (i) a severance payment equal to two times the sum of (A) his annual base salary and (B) his target annual
incentive compensation, (ii) a pro-rated portion of his target annual incentive compensation for the year of termination, (iii) at his request, the same or
substantially similar outplacement services as those generally offered to the Company’s executive officers, and (iv) on a pre-tax basis, the medical, dental
and vision benefits substantially similar to those he received prior to termination for 18 months following termination.

materials known to be relevant to such investigation or the inducement of others to fail to cooperate or produce documents or other
materials in connection with such investigation.
●
“Change in Control” has the same meaning as set forth in the Bates Employment Agreement.
●
“Good Reason” means the occurrence after a Change in Control of the Company of any of the following conditions without the
executive’s written consent (each, a “Good Reason Condition”); provided, that the executive has completed all steps of the Good Reason
Process (defined below) following the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a material diminution in the executive’s
responsibilities, authority or duties; (ii) a material diminution in the executive’s base salary except for across-the-board salary reductions
based on the Company’s financial performance similarly affecting all of substantially all senior management employees of the Company;

30 miles of driving distance to such location from your principal residence as of such change; or (iv) a material breach of the Change in
Control Agreement by the Company. The “Good Reason Process” consists of the same steps set forth in the Bates Employment
Agreement.

Severance Plan
Executive officers are also eligible for severance benefits under the Severance Plan for Leadership Team Officers of GCP Applied Technologies Inc. (the
“Severance Plan”) to the extent the executive officer’s termination of employment is not related to a Change in Control. Under the Severance Plan,
benefits are payable to an executive officer upon a qualifying involuntary termination of employment, permanent disability or death, subject to the
executive’s execution and non-revocation of a release agreement. Severance benefits include a lump sum cash payment equal to up to one times the sum
of the executive’s base salary plus target bonus, a prorated payment of the executive’s annual incentive cash award and continued health coverage at
employee rates for a period of up to 24 months following the executive’s termination of employment.
Retention Bonuses
In connection with the Merger, the Company approved the grant of retention bonuses to certain employees and executive officers, with a total bonus
pool of $12,000,000 (the “Retention Bonuses”). The Retention Bonuses are being granted pursuant to a form of retention incentive agreement (the
“Retention Agreement”) approved by the Company and are being put in place to retain key talent during the period between the signing of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, assuming a closing within 12 months after the date of the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the
Retention Agreement, 50% of the Retention Bonus will be payable within 60 days following the consummation of the Merger, with the remaining 50%
payable within 60 days following the date that is 90 days following the consummation of the Merger, subject to the employee’s continued employment
with the Company through the consummation of the Merger and the date that is 90 days following the consummation of the Merger, respectively.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a recipient of a Retention Bonus is terminated by the Company without “cause” or resigns for “good reason”
(as such terms are defined in the Retention Agreement), subject to the individual’s execution of a release, the Company will pay such individual any
unpaid portion of the individual’s Retention Bonus. Retention Bonuses for the executive officers are — Mr. Bates: $825,000; Mr. Valente: $630,000; Mr.
Merrill: $600,000; Mr. Campos: $256,750; Ms. Mennenga: $325,000; and Mr. Waddell: $180,690.
Continuing Employees
The Merger Agreement provides that from the Effective Time until 12 months following the effective time, each employee of GCP and any of its
subsidiaries who, as of the closing of the Merger, continues to be employed with GCP or any of its subsidiaries (each, a “Continuing Employee”) will
receive (i) base salary or wages and a target annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less than the base compensation and target annual cash bonus
opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and benefits (excluding equity
award compensation and any change in control or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits) that are substantially equivalent in aggregate
economic value to other compensation and benefits provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, Parent will
or will cause its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to assume, honor and continue during the 12 month period following the Effective Time
all of the Company’s employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements, in each case, as in effect
at the Effective Time. With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent and its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation (including any
vacation, paid time off and severance plans), for all purposes, including determining a Continuing Employee’s eligibility to participate, level benefits,
vesting and benefit accruals, each Continuing Employee’s service with GCP or any of its subsidiaries, as reflected in GCP records, will be treated as
service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries to the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited to such Continuing Employee
under the analogous GCP benefit plan as of the Effective Time (except to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits and
excluding with respect to any defined benefit plans).

Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table provides information about certain compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger. The amounts in the table were calculated using outstanding Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PBUs held by each named
executive officer as of the Record Date and a per-share price for GCP common stock of $32.00 (i.e., the Merger Consideration), and assumes the Merger
closed on the Record Date. The compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below is subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of the
stockholders of GCP, as described in “Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation” on page 112 of this proxy
statement.
The amounts in the following table are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this
proxy statement, and do not include amounts that were vested as of the Record Date. In addition, certain amounts will vary depending on the actual date
of closing of the Merger, which is presently expected to be in the second half of 2022, but assumed for purposes of the calculations underlying this table
to occur on the Record Date. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the
amounts set forth below. In the footnotes to the table below, we refer to payments that are conditioned on the occurrence of both the Merger and the
named executive officer’s qualifying termination of employment as being payable on a “double trigger” basis and payments or benefits that are
conditioned only upon the occurrence of the Merger as being payable on a “single trigger” basis.

The amounts in this column represent aggregate cash severance payments that each named executive officer would be entitled to receive under his
applicable Change in Control Agreement, or in the case of Mr. Bates, under the Bates Employment Agreement, if his employment were terminated
by GCP without Cause or by the named executive officer for Good Reason on the Record Date. Lesser amounts are payable in the event of such an
employment termination without the occurrence of the Merger. See “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the
Merger—Executive Severance Benefits” on page 62 of this proxy statement for a description of each named executive officer’s severance rights
under the executive’s applicable Change in Control Agreement or, for Mr. Bates, the Bates Employment Agreement. These amounts are payable on
a double-trigger basis.

payments. As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 23, 2021, Messrs. Bates and Merrill each received accelerated
payment in 2021 of earned annual bonuses for fiscal year 2021 and accelerated vesting of certain equity awards to take advantage of tax planning
opportunities that the Company believes could benefit both the Company and the executives.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Under the Merger Agreement, beginning at the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
shall advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the charter, by-laws or similar organizational documents of GCP
and any contract of GCP or its subsidiaries, in each case as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, each current and former director and officer
of GCP and its subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who serves as a fiduciary of a GCP benefit plan (each, an “Indemnitee”), against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with
any proceeding or investigation, whether civil or criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Merger.
Under the Merger Agreement, Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or
otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Merger)
existing as of the Effective Time in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in GCP’s charter or bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect as of the
date of the Merger Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less
than six years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses provisions in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in (i) the applicable party’s certificate
68
Table of Contents
of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect as the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) any contract of GCP or its
subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement with any of their respective directors, officers or employees, and will not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the
Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of GCP or its subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such proceeding.
The Merger Agreement provides that, from and for six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will maintain for the benefit of
those persons that are directors and officers of GCP as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date of the Merger an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time, that is substantially equivalent to, and in any event not
less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of GCP. However, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is not available, the Surviving
Corporation will maintain the best coverage available; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an annual
premium for the directors’ and officers’ insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by GCP prior to the date of the Merger Agreement.
Parent may satisfy this requirement by purchasing a prepaid “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, which provides such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in
respect of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or Merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each case, Parent will cause proper provisions to be made so that the successor or assign will expressly assume
the obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Appraisal Rights",68,77
GCP Applied Technologies Inc._20220131_DEFM14A_19806508_4372223.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
General
If the Merger is completed, holders of shares of GCP common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly
demand an appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal
rights in connection with the Merger. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to timely and
properly comply with such statutory requirements will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.
This section summarizes certain material provisions of the DGCL pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion, however, is not a full summary
of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is
attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference herein. All references within Section 262 of the DGCL to “stockholder” are
to the record holder of shares of GCP common stock. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a
recommendation as to whether or not a GCP stockholder should exercise its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under the DGCL, if you hold one or more shares of GCP common stock, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, continuously are
the record holder of such shares through the effective date of the Merger and otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL, you will be entitled to have your shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive the “fair value” of such shares (as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
69Table of Contents
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) in cash, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. It is
possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration
which GCP stockholders will be entitled to receive upon the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as
appraisal rights.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, not less than 20 days prior to the special meeting at which the adoption of the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the
stockholders, GCP must notify each stockholder who was a GCP stockholder on the Record Date and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that
appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes the required notice, and a
copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement.
A HOLDER OF GCP COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO
SHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS AND APPENDIX B CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO COMPLY PRECISELY WITH THE PROCEDURES
OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IN A TIMELY AND PROPER MANNER WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF THE
COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, A HOLDER OF GCP
COMMON STOCK WHO IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO EXERCISE ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS, IS ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN
LEGAL COUNSEL. ANY SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK HELD BY A GCP STOCKHOLDER WHO FAILS TO PERFECT, SUCCESSFULLY
WITHDRAWS OR OTHERWISE LOSES HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL RIGHTS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CONVERTED AS OF THE
EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.
How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights
If you are a GCP stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of GCP common stock, you must comply with ALL of the
following:
●
you must NOT vote “FOR,” or otherwise consent in writing to, the Merger Proposal. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but
does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, if you submit a proxy and
wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must include voting instructions to vote your share “AGAINST,” or as an abstention with
respect to, the Merger Proposal;
●
you must continuously hold your shares of GCP common stock from the date of making the demand through the effective date of the
Merger. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer your shares of GCP common stock before the effective date of the Merger;
●
prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, if you are a holder of record, you must deliver a proper
written demand for appraisal of your shares, and if you are a beneficial holder, the bank, broker or other nominee that holds shares on your
behalf must deliver a proper written demand for appraisal of the shares you hold beneficially; and
●
you, another stockholder, an appropriate beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded appraisal or the
Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of
GCP common stock within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any
such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of GCP stockholders to
initiate all necessary action to properly demand their appraisal rights in respect of shares of GCP common stock within the time prescribed
in Section 262 of the DGCL.
70
Table of Contents
Filing a Written Demand
Neither voting against the Merger Proposal, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal, will in and of itself constitute a written
demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. A record holder of shares of GCP common stock wishing to exercise
appraisal rights must deliver to GCP, before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the
stockholder’s shares. A stockholder’s failure to deliver the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special meeting
will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger
Proposal.
A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record. Only a holder of record may demand appraisal rights for the shares
of GCP common stock registered in that holder’s name. Such demand will be not be sufficient unless it reasonably informs GCP of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of the “fair value” of his, her or its shares of GCP common stock. Beneficial owners who
do not also hold their shares of GCP common stock of record may not directly make appraisal demands to GCP. The beneficial owner must, in such case,
arrange for the holder of record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, to timely submit the required demand in respect of those shares of GCP common
stock. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or nominee, who holds shares of GCP common stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may
exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of GCP common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other
beneficial owners. The written demand should state the number of shares of GCP common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of
shares of GCP common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of GCP common stock held in the name of the
holder of record.
IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND YOU WISH
TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKER OR NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE
PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A
BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE
OR INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER
THE STEPS NECESSARY TO DEMAND YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES OF GCP COMMON STOCK THROUGH A BANK
OR BROKERAGE WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE, SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY
TRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND
MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD.
If your shares of GCP common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand for
appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if your shares are owned of record jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy
in common, the demand for appraisal should be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more
joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and
expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder or holders of record. Stockholders who hold their
shares of GCP common stock in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their
brokers or other nominees to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.

If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:
GCP Applied Technologies Inc.
2325 Lakeview Parkway
Alpharetta, Georgia 30009
Attention: Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary
At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, any GCP stockholder that made a demand for appraisal but has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined in such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration
in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of GCP common stock by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal
of the demand for appraisal, but after such 60 day period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written approval of the Surviving
Corporation.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation. Within 10 days after the effective date of the Merger, GCP, as the Surviving Corporation, must notify each holder of
GCP common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal
of the date that the Merger has become effective.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not later, a stockholder
of record, a beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded appraisal, or the Surviving Corporation may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed
by a record or beneficial holder, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of GCP common stock held by all stockholders who have properly
demanded appraisal. None of Parent, Merger Sub or GCP, as the Surviving Corporation is under any obligation to file an appraisal petition or has any
intention to do so. If you desire to have your shares of GCP common stock appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for properly demanding
your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, provided you have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, you will be entitled to
receive from the Surviving Corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of GCP common stock not voted
in favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which GCP has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares.
The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (i) ten days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the request
therefor or (ii) ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares of GCP common stock
held in a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition and request from the Surviving Corporation
the statement described in this paragraph.
If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or if you deliver to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation,
then the right to appraisal will cease.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will be obligated,
within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Court of Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of GCP common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares
of GCP common stock have not been reached by the Surviving Corporation. After notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by
registered or certified mail to the Surviving
72
Table of Contents
Corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is
empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine which GCP stockholders have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and have become
entitled to appraisal rights and may require the GCP stockholders demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares of GCP common stock to submit their
stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to any GCP stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
and the costs thereof shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. In addition, assuming common stock of GCP remains listed on a national securities
exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which we expect to be the case), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders
of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of GCP common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%
of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares of GCP
common stock exceeds $1.0 million.
The appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of GCP common
stock held by all GCP stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the
effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that
time. Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the Surviving Corporation and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the GCP
stockholders entitled to receive the same, forthwith in the case of uncertificated stockholders or upon surrender by certificated stockholders to the
Surviving Corporation of their stock certificates.
In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated
that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other factors which were known or which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects
of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does
not
73
Table of Contents
encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or
expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature
of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” An
opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to fair
value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of GCP common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than,
the same as or less than the Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor GCP, as the Surviving Corporation, anticipates offering more than the Merger
Consideration to any GCP stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of
Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of GCP common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. No representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, you will lose the right to an appraisal and will instead receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of
experts) and may tax those costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of GCP
common stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such an order, each party to the appraisal proceeding bears its own expenses.
If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you will not, from and after the effective date of the Merger, be
entitled to vote the shares of GCP common stock subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares,
except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of GCP common stock as of a record date prior to the effective date of the Merger.
If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept
the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the consideration payable in the Merger to
the Surviving Corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the Merger will require written approval
of the Surviving Corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the
approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided,
however, that this provision will not affect the right of any GCP stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the
Merger within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger. If you fail to properly demand or successfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or
otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of GCP common stock will be deemed to have been converted as of the effective date of the Merger into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.
Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for properly demanding appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In
that event, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares of GCP common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each as
defined below) of shares of GCP common stock who receive cash in exchange for such shares of GCP common stock pursuant to the Merger. This
discussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of the Merger. The
tax consequences of the Merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable
state, local and non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue
Service (the “IRS”), in each case, in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations,
and any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions
set forth in this summary. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. We have not sought, and do not intend to
seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. There can be no assurance the
IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.
This discussion is limited to holders of shares of GCP common stock who hold such shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:
●
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
●
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
●
U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
●
persons holding shares of GCP common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion
transaction or other integrated investment;
●
banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions;
●
brokers or dealers in securities;
●
traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;
●
“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S.
federal income tax;
●
“S corporations,” partnerships or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other
pass-through entities (and investors therein);
●
real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies;
●
tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;
75Table of Contents
●
persons deemed to sell their shares of GCP common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;
●
persons who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or, following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation;
●
persons who hold or received their shares of GCP common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as
compensation;
●
tax-qualified retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts; and
●
“qualified foreign pension funds” as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of the Code and entities all of the interests of which are held by qualified
foreign pension funds.
This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares of GCP common stock who exercise appraisal rights
in connection with the Merger under the DGCL.
If an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of GCP common stock, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations
made at the partner level.
Accordingly, partnerships holding shares of GCP common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to them.
THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE. HOLDERS OF SHARES OF GCP COMMON
STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER ARISING
UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS OTHER THAN THOSE PERTAINING TO INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS, OR
UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
Definition of a U.S. Holder
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of GCP common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is
treated as:
●
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
●
a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the
District of Columbia;
●
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
●
a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a
“United States person” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Effect of the Merger
The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of GCP common stock in the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. The amount of any taxable gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder who receives cash for shares of GCP common stock in the Merger
will generally equal
76
Table of Contents
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for such shares (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a share will generally be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for
such share. The amount and character of such gain or loss and the holding period of shares will be determined separately for each block of shares of GCP
common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for cash in the Merger. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S.
holder upon the receipt of cash in exchange for a share of GCP common stock in the Merger will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such share for more than one year at the Effective Time. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term
capital gain or loss which is subject to U.S. federal income tax at the same rates as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-
corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
A surtax of up to 3.8% may apply to so-called “net investment income” of certain U.S. citizens or residents, and to undistributed “net investment income”
of certain estates and trusts. Net investment income includes any gain recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GCP common stock
pursuant to the Merger. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the applicability of the surtax on gain recognized pursuant to the
Merger.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of GCP common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS
and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an
exemption should complete and return to the paying agent a properly executed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal certifying (1) that such
holder is a U.S. person, (2) that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and (3) that such holder is not subject to backup withholding.
Certain U.S. holders (including corporations) are not subject to backup withholding or information reporting rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided, the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder
For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of GCP common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or
arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Effect of the Merger
A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GCP
common stock in the Merger unless:
●
the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, such gain is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of an individual, a fixed base,
maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States);
77
Table of Contents
●
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the
disposition of shares of GCP common stock in the Merger, and certain other requirements are met; or
●
GCP is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the
shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of GCP common stock,
and the non-U.S. holder held (actually or constructively) more than five percent of the total fair market value of all shares of GCP common
stock at any time during such applicable period.
Gain described in the first bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal
income tax rates in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax
treaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that such after-tax profits are not reinvested and maintained in
the U.S. business.
Gain described in the second bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified
under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not
considered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
With respect to the third bullet point above, the determination of whether GCP is a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of its U.S. real property
interests relative to the fair market value of its other trade or business assets and its United States and foreign real property interests. GCP believes that it
has not been a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes during the five-year period preceding the Merger.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made to non-U.S. holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%).
Non-U.S. holders generally can avoid information reporting and backup withholding by providing the paying agent with an applicable and properly
executed IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (or successor form), as the case may be, certifying under penalties of perjury the holder’s non-U.S.
status (and the payor or applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person as defined
under the Code) or by otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an
applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a
non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
THE DISCUSSION ABOVE OF MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF ALL TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER. THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger",83,87
GCP Applied Technologies Inc._20220131_DEFM14A_19806508_4372223.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
GCP and Parent have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and obtain all regulatory
approvals required to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals
include the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
“HSR Act”) and clearance of the Merger having been granted under the antitrust and/or foreign investment laws, as applicable, of the European Union,
the United Kingdom, Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Russia and Serbia. Parent has agreed to use its best efforts (including, if necessary,
through litigation or the sale, divestiture or disposition of assets) to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable
competition and foreign investment law. Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you
that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals
will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or will not require
changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Parent, in its good faith reasonable discretion, has the right to take reasonable periods of time in order to advocate and negotiate with third parties and
governmental entities with respect to its obligations to take certain actions under the Merger Agreement in order to obtain approvals under competition
and foreign investment laws, provided that such periods of time do not prevent the parties from consummating the Merger by no later than the Outside
Date. In addition, none of GCP, Parent or their respective affiliates is required to agree to take or enter into any such action that is not conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger.
Parent is entitled to: (i) control and lead all communications, meetings, negotiations and strategy for dealing with any governmental entity and (ii) control
and lead the defense strategy for dealing with any administrative or judicial action or proceeding that is initiated or threatened to be initiated challenging
the Merger Agreement by any governmental entity or relates to any competition laws. However, Parent is required to consult in good faith with GCP in
connection with such control and leadership by Parent and that such control and leadership do not prevent the consummation of the Merger by the
Outside Date.
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Merger cannot be completed until GCP and
Parent each file a notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act
and the applicable waiting period thereunder has expired or been terminated.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC
or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the expiration or termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private
parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

European Commission Antitrust Approval
Both GCP and Parent operate in the European Union. While the Merger is not reportable to the European Union as a single review under the primary or
alternative jurisdictional thresholds, because the Merger is reportable under the merger control rules of at least three EU Member States, the Merger is
eligible for a referral of jurisdiction to review the Merger from the relevant Member States to the European Commission (the “EC”) at the parties’ request
under Article 4(5) of Council Regulation 139/2004 (the “EU Merger Regulation”). To request the EC to review the merger, Parent and GCP must first submit
to the EC a reasoned submission (through a so-called Form RS) explaining why it is objectively preferable for the EC to take sole jurisdiction over the
merger control review in the European Union. After submission of the Form RS, if no EU Member State with jurisdiction to review the Merger has
expressed, within 15 working days from the date of submission of the Form RS, its objections to the EC taking on jurisdiction to review the Merger,
jurisdiction for reviewing the Merger will pass exclusively to the EC. The parties will then begin a process of pre-notification prior to proceeding with a
formal notification to the EC. The pre-notification is not technically mandatory but it is required in practice and there is no regulatory deadline for this
period. Once the Merger is formally notified to the EC (through a so-called Form CO), the EC has 25 working days (beginning on the first business day
following the date on which a complete formal notification is received by the EC), which period may be extended to 35 working days if the parties offer
remedies by Day 15 at the latest, to issue a decision as to whether to clear the Offer and the Merger or to initiate an in-depth (so called “Phase II”)
investigation. The EC will initiate a Phase II investigation if it finds that the Merger gives rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the EU internal
market. If the EC initiates a Phase II investigation, it has 90 working days following the decision to open a Phase II investigation, which period may be
extended by up to 35 working days under certain circumstances, to decide whether to declare the Merger compatible with the EU internal market
(unconditionally or subject to remedies) or to prohibit its implementation. The EC also has the power to suspend the timetable for a Phase II review in
circumstances where the parties have failed to comply with a statutory request for information from the EC in a full or timely manner.
UK Antitrust Approval
Under the Enterprise Act 2002, as amended by the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (the “Enterprise Act”), notification of the Merger to the
Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) is voluntary even where the relevant jurisdictional thresholds are met, meaning that the parties can
complete and implement a transaction without notifying and obtaining prior clearance of the CMA. In the case at hand, the parties have decided to make
a voluntary notification with the CMA. Under the Merger Agreement, completion of the Merger is conditioned upon receipt of approval from the CMA in
response to the voluntary notification.
Prior to the formal submission of a merger notice, the parties are strongly advised to initiate pre-notification discussions with the case team. There is no
regulatory deadline for this period. Once the formal filing is made, the CMA must make a decision within 40 working days after the CMA confirms that
either the merger notice is complete or it has received sufficient information to enable it to begin its investigation (“CMA Phase 1”). There is no provision
for formally extending the CMA Phase 1 review period, although the CMA has the power to suspend the review in circumstances where the parties have
failed to comply with a statutory request for information from the CMA in full or in a timely manner. The 40-working day limit can also be extended by up
to 90 working days from the date of the CMA Phase 1 decision if undertakings in lieu of a reference to CMA Phase 2 are accepted in CMA Phase 1.
If the CMA is of the view that there is a realistic prospect that the Merger could result in a substantial lessening of competition (“SLC”), the CMA,
subject to very limited exceptions, would have a duty to refer the transaction for an in depth second phase investigation. The CMA has 24 weeks
(extendable by up to a further 8 weeks) (“CMA Phase 2”) from the date of referral to CMA Phase 2 to investigate and make its final decision although as
with Phase 1, the CMA has the power to suspend the review in circumstances where the parties have failed to comply with a statutory request for
information from the CMA in full or in a timely manner. The CMA
80
Table of Contents
Phase 2 investigation can be suspended for up to three weeks at the parties’ request if the CMA reasonably believes that the Merger may be abandoned
by the merger parties. If the CMA concludes at the end of CMA Phase 2 that the Merger may be expected to result in an SLC, it may take action for the
purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the SLC, including prohibiting the Merger or conditionally approving the completion of the Merger.
Other Regulatory Approvals
Completion of the transaction is further subject to the receipt of additional clearances and/or approval under the antitrust and/or foreign investment laws
of Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Russia and Serbia.

Merger Consideration
Common Stock
At the Effective Time, each share of GCP common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares held by GCP
as treasury stock or held by Parent or Merger Sub or any
83Table of Contents
wholly-owned subsidiary of GCP, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as described below)) will be converted automatically into the right to
receive $32.00 per share, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (the “Merger Consideration”). All shares of GCP common stock
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time and will thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Outstanding Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides for the following treatment with respect to equity awards relating to GCP common stock:
Stock Options
At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of GCP common stock (each, a “Company Option”) whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or GCP, be
cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the total number of shares of GCP
common stock underlying the Company Option multiplied by (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company
Option; provided that any such Company Option with respect to which the exercise price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
Each outstanding award of GCP restricted stock (“Company Restricted Stock”) and each outstanding award of GCP restricted stock units (“Company
RSUs”), in each case, that is vested at the Effective Time or is subject solely to service-based vesting conditions shall become fully vested and shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or GCP, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash equal to (a) the total number of shares of GCP common stock underlying such award of Company Restricted Stock or
Company RSUs, as applicable, multiplied by (b) the Merger Consideration.
Performance Based Stock Units
Each outstanding award of GCP performance based stock units (“Company PBUs”) that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions shall become
vested as to the greater of the number of shares of GCP common stock subject to such Company PBUs that would vest based on (1) the target level of
achievement and (2) GCP’s actual level of achievement of the performance goals set forth in the applicable award agreement as of the Effective Time, as
determined by the Board or its compensation committee prior to the closing, and shall, after giving effect to such vesting, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof or GCP, be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal
to (a) the number of vested shares of GCP common stock underlying such Company PBUs, multiplied by (b) the Merger Consideration. Any outstanding
Company PBUs (or portion thereof) that are not vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled for no consideration.

Any shares of GCP common stock held by stockholders who are entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal rights for such shares in accordance
with, and who comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (such shares,
the “Dissenting Shares”). At the Effective Time, all such Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist, and the holders of such Dissenting Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights granted to them under Section 262 of
the DGCL. If any such stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such stockholder’s right to appraisal under the DGCL or other
applicable law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares will cease, and the Dissenting Shares will be deemed to
have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding

Exchange and Payment Procedures",93,93
GCP Applied Technologies Inc._20220131_DEFM14A_19806508_4372223.Pdf,Exchange and Payment Procedures,"Exchange and Payment Procedures
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a nationally recognized paying agent (the identity and terms of designation and appointment of
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company), to make payments of the Merger Consideration to stockholders. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited with the paying agent, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which the holders of GCP common stock are
entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation will
cause the paying agent to mail to each person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of GCP common stock represented by a
stock certificate, which shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal together with instructions for
effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon receipt of (i) a surrendered certificate or certificates
(or affidavit of loss) in respect of such shares together with the signed letter of transmittal (in the case of shares of GCP common stock represented by a
stock certificate), or (ii) the receipt of the signed letter of transmittal (in the case of shares of GCP common stock held in book-entry form (other than
shares held through The Depository Trust Company)), paying agent, in accordance with the letter of transmittal and instructions, shall transmit to the
holder of such shares the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor and such certificates or book-entry shares shall be cancelled. The amount of any
Merger Consideration paid to the stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the paying agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its
nominee, in respect of each book-entry share held through The Depository Trust Company, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the
Merger Consideration (without interest, and after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) that holders of such book-entry shares shall be
automatically entitled to receive, and such book-entry shares of such holder shall be cancelled.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of GCP shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares on the
records of GCP, and holders of certificates and book-entry shares will no longer have rights with respect to the shares except as provided in the Merger
Agreement or by applicable law. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of stock certificates or transfer of book-entry shares in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares formerly represented
by such certificate or book-entry shares. If, after the Effective Time, certificates that represented ownership of shares of GCP common stock or any book-
entry shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent remains undistributed to holders of GCP common stock on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, such
cash (including any interest received in respect thereto) will be
85Table of Contents
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of GCP common stock who has not complied with the exchange procedures in the Merger
Agreement will thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon and subject to any applicable withholding taxes and abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws. Any Merger Consideration that remains
unclaimed by the holders of GCP common stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
governmental entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claim or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the paying agent to pay for
shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand.
If any stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such stock certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed (and if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in a reasonable sum as Parent may reasonably direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the paying agent with respect to such stock
certificate), the paying agent will, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement.",93,94

In addition, many of GCP’s representations and warranties are qualified by knowledge or by a materiality or a “Company Material Adverse Effect”
standard. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect” means any change, event, occurrence or development (an
“Effect”) that, individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition or results of operations of GCP and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that to the extent adverse Effects arise out of, result
from or are attributable to the following, such Effects shall not constitute or be deemed to contribute to a Company Material Adverse Effect, and shall not
otherwise be taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur:

●
any change in general economic, business, labor or regulatory conditions or in securities, credit or other financial markets in the United
States or globally or changes generally affecting the industries (including seasonal fluctuations) in which GCP or its subsidiaries operate

relative to other companies operating in the same industries);
●
any change in global or national political conditions (including the outbreak or escalation of war (whether declared or not), military action,
sabotage or acts of terrorism) changes due to natural disasters or changes in the weather or changes due to the outbreak or worsening of
an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis (including COVID-19, or any COVID-19 measures or changes in such COVID-19 measures
after the date of the Merger Agreement) (except to the extent the change disproportionately impacts GCP relative to other companies
operating in the same industries);
●
any actions or omissions required of GCP under the Merger Agreement or taken or not taken at the written request of or with the consent
of, Saint-Gobain or Parent (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, compliance by GCP and its subsidiaries with the first sentence of

From and after the date of the Merger Agreement, GCP is subject to customary “no shop” restrictions prohibiting GCP and its representatives from
soliciting acquisition proposals from third parties or providing information to or participating in any discussions or negotiations with third parties
regarding acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement and described below. Except as expressly permitted by
the Merger Agreement, from and after the date of the Merger Agreement, GCP shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to (x)
cause its and their respective representatives acting on their behalf to, promptly cease and cause to be terminated any and all activities, discussions or
negotiations with any third party conducted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal, including immediately
terminating all access granted to any third party to any physical or electronic data room, and (y) request that any such third party (and its agents and
advisors) promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning GCP and its subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of GCP and its
subsidiaries. GCP has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and its subsidiaries’ respective directors, officers and employees not to, and to
direct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other respective representatives on their behalf not to, directly or indirectly:
●
initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly facilitate, encourage or induce the making, the submission or the announcement of any acquisition
proposal;
●
conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information relating to GCP or any of its
subsidiaries, to any third party or its representatives, or afford to any third party or its representatives access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information of GCP or its subsidiaries, in each case, that could reasonably be expected to lead
to the submission of an acquisition proposal;
●
except where the Board makes a good faith determination that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with GCP directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable law, amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of
equity securities of GCP or any of its subsidiaries;
●
approve, recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, term sheet or other
contract relating to any acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction, other than a confidentiality agreement in the circumstance and
upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement; or
●
except as expressly contemplated in the Merger Agreement, terminate, waive or amend or grant any exemptions or redeem any rights under
the Amended Rights Agreement.
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, until the receipt of the stockholders’ approval of the Merger Proposal or the earlier termination
of the Merger Agreement and described below, neither the Board nor any committee thereof will:
●
adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or otherwise declare advisable any acquisition proposal or any offer or proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
●
withhold, withdraw, modify, change or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Board’s recommendation with respect to
the Merger (which we refer to as the Board Recommendation);
●
in the event of a publicly announced acquisition proposal, fail to publicly reaffirm the Board Recommendation within ten (10) business
days following request from Parent to do so;
●
fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender or exchange offer for shares of GCP common stock within ten (10) business days after
the commencement of such offer or fail to maintain at any time such a recommendation against such offer at any time before the expiration
or withdrawal of such offer;

●
fail to include the Board Recommendation in the proxy statement; or
●
resolve, publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
We refer to any of the actions described in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth bullets as a “change of recommendation.”
If at any time following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval (i) GCP has received a bona fide written
acquisition proposal from a third party, and (ii) GCP has not breached the no shop restrictions in the Merger Agreement in any material respect with
respect to such acquisition proposal, then (x) GCP may engage (over a period of up to two business days) with such third party solely to clarify the terms
and conditions thereof for the purpose of informing the Board of such terms and conditions and (y) if the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, based on information then available) that such
acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, GCP may, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
(a) furnish information with respect to GCP and its subsidiaries to the third party making such acquisition proposal, its representatives pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement that is no less favorable to GCP than its confidentiality agreement with Saint-Gobain and (b) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such third party regarding such acquisition proposal; provided, that any non-public information concerning GCP or its subsidiaries
provided or made available to any third party will be provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub (to the extent it has not been provided or made
available already), as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than 48 hours) after it is provided or made available to such third party.
From and after the date of the Merger Agreement, GCP agrees to promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing of the receipt of any
acquisition proposal, which notice will identify the third party making such acquisition proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead
to an acquisition proposal and include (i) the identity of the third party making such acquisition proposal, and (ii) a copy of such acquisition proposal,
acquisition agreement or inquiry and any financing commitments (but excluding any fee letters that are customarily redacted with respect thereto)
received by GCP in connection therewith (or, where such acquisition proposal or inquiry was not submitted in writing, a reasonable written description
summarizing the material terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal or inquiry). Without limiting the foregoing, GCP will as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 48 hours of such determination) advise Parent if GCP determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The foregoing obligations of GCP also apply with
respect to any amended, revised or subsequent acquisition proposal. GCP may not, and is required to cause its subsidiaries not to enter into any contract
with any person that prohibits or otherwise limits GCP from providing any information contemplated by the Merger Agreement to Parent or its
representatives or otherwise complying with GCP’s obligations under the Merger Agreement.
If GCP receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from a breach, in any material respect,
of the Merger Agreement, and that the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a superior proposal, the Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval, effect a
change of recommendation with respect to such superior proposal and/or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a company acquisition agreement
with respect to such superior proposal pursuant to the terms thereof, in either case subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. GCP,
however, is not entitled to effect a change of recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement unless:
●
GCP shall have provided to Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice of GCP’s intention to take such action, which notice
shall specify (1) that it has received a written bona fide acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn and that the Board has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a superior proposal, (2) to the

extent not previously provided to Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement (and without limiting the obligations under the Merger
Agreement, the material terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal (including the form and amount of consideration offered
therein and the identity of the Person or group making the acquisition proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided unredacted
copies of all company acquisition agreements and financing commitments (but excluding any fee letters that are customarily redacted with
respect thereto) received by GCP in connection with such acquisition proposal, and (3) that, subject to the third bullet below, the Board
has determined to effect a change of recommendation and/or to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms in order to enter
into the company acquisition agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal absent revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
as applicable;
●
during the three business day notice period described above, if requested by Parent, GCP will have, and will have caused its legal and
financial advisors to have, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its representatives regarding any amendment to the Merger
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and intended to cause the relevant acquisition proposal to no longer constitute a superior
proposal; and
●
the Board will have considered in good faith any adjustments and/or proposed amendments to the Merger Agreement (including a change
to the price terms thereof) and other agreements contemplated thereby that were irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent no later than
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the last day of such four business day notice period, and will have determined in good faith, that the
acquisition proposal would continue to constitute a superior proposal if such amendments or modifications proposed by Parent were to
be given effect.
In the event of any revision to the amount or form of consideration or any other material terms or conditions of such acquisition proposal, GCP is required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with all of its obligations set forth in the no shop restrictions of the Merger Agreement with
respect to such new written notice, except that the notice period with respect to such revision shall be two business days rather than three business
days.
In response to an intervening event prior to the receipt of the company stockholder approval, the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may
effect a change of recommendation only if:
●
GCP shall have (A) promptly provided to Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice of the Board’s intention to take such
action, which notice shall (i) specify in reasonable detail information describing the underlying material facts giving rise to the intervening
event, and (ii) state that, subject to the third bullet below, the Board has determined to effect a change of recommendation absent
revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement and (B) complied in all material respects with its obligations under the Merger Agreement;
●
during the intervening event notice period, if requested by Parent, GCP shall have, and shall have caused its legal and financial advisors to
have, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment to the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by Parent
such that the failure of the Board to effect a change of recommendation in response to the intervening event in accordance with the below
clause would no longer be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and
●
the Board shall have considered in good faith the proposed changed terms no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of
the intervening event notice period and the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to effect a change of recommendation in response to such intervening event would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
We refer to such three-day period as the “intervening event notice period.”

promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) make any disclosure to the stockholders of GCP if the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or violate applicable laws; provided, however, that GCP may only make such a disclosure that constitutes a change
of recommendation in compliance with applicable terms of the Merger Agreement. The issuance by GCP or the Board of a “stop, look and listen”
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, will not constitute a
change of recommendation.

transaction;
●
“acquisition transaction” means any transaction or series of transactions (other than the Merger) involving (i) any merger, consolidation,

beneficially own securities representing 20% or more of the total outstanding voting power of GCP after giving effect to the consummation
of such transaction or series of transactions (other than a transaction or series of transactions that do not change such third party’s or
group’s beneficial ownership from before such transaction or series of transactions), (ii) a direct or indirect purchase, license, lease or
other acquisition by any third party or group of third parties of assets of GCP (including equity interests of any GCP subsidiary) or its
subsidiaries constituting 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets of GCP and its subsidiaries based on
their fair market value as of the date of such purchase, license, lease or other acquisition of GCP and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii)
any direct or indirect acquisition by any third party or group of third parties representing 20% or more of the voting power of GCP after

proposal;
●
“superior proposal” means any bona fide written acquisition proposal (except the references therein to “20% or more” in the definition of
acquisition transaction shall be deemed replaced with “75%” in each place it appears) after the date of the Merger Agreement the Board

taking into account such factors as the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) considers in good faith to be appropriate (including
the conditionality, timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposals), (A) is from a financial point of view, more favorable to GCP’s
stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (B) is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed.

GCP, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to complete, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to:
●
obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties in connection with the Merger;
●
obtain all necessary or advisable actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from governmental
entities (including those in connection with specified competition laws), make all necessary or advisable registrations, declarations and
filings with and take all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any proceeding by, any governmental
entity (including those in connection with specified competition laws) in order to consummate the Merger;
●
resist, contest or defend against any proceeding (including judicial or administrative proceedings), challenging the Merger or the
completion of the other transactions contemplated thereby, including seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that could restrict, prevent or
prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and
●
execute and deliver any reasonable additional instruments consistent with the Merger Agreement that are necessary to consummate the
transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of the Merger Agreement.
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement will furnish to each other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. In furtherance of the foregoing and subject to applicable law relating to the exchange of
information, GCP and Parent shall have the right to review, as far in advance as practicable, all of the information relating to GCP or Parent, as the case may
be, and any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries, that appears in any filing to be made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any third party
and/or any governmental entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. With regard to the rights
above, GCP and Parent will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable law and the instructions of any governmental entity, GCP
and Parent will keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other written substantive communications received by GCP, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates or subsidiaries, as the case may be, from any governmental entity and/or third party with respect to such transactions, and, to
the extent permitted under the circumstances, will provide the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to attend and participate in any meeting
with any governmental entity in respect of any substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. Additionally, GCP and Parent agreed to, and to cause their respective affiliates and subsidiaries to, make or cause to be made all
filings required under specified competition laws with
96Table of Contents
respect to the Merger as promptly as practicable and, in any event, file all required HSR Act pre-merger notifications and report forms by such time to be
mutually agreed in good faith by Parent and the Company in order to cause the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act to occur
as promptly as practicable.
Parent has agreed to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings
necessary to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any specified competition law that may be asserted by any governmental entity
with respect to the Merger so as to allow the closing of the Merger to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the applicable
Outside Date, as defined below), including:
●
proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing
or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses of Parent or GCP or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; or
●
accepting any operational restrictions or otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit Parent’s, the Company’s or any of their
respective affiliate’s or subsidiary’s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights,
product lines, operations or businesses of Parent or GCP or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the closing of the Merger.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates and subsidiaries not to (i) take any action the effect of which, or refrain
from taking any action the effect of refraining from which, would be to delay or impede the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement beyond the Outside Date, or (ii) directly or indirectly acquire or agree to acquire any Person or portion thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger
or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (A) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining any
approvals of any governmental entities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, in each case, by the Outside Date, (B) materially increase the risk of any governmental entity seeking an
order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the Outside Date, (C) materially increase the risk of
not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise by the Outside date or (D) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the Outside Date.
If such efforts fail to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any specified competition law that may be asserted by any
governmental entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the closing to occur, then Parent shall use its best efforts to defend through litigation on
the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any order (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that would prevent the closing of the Merger from occurring as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, no later than the applicable
Outside Date). Notwithstanding any provision of the Merger Agreement, (i) GCP shall not take or agree to take any of the foregoing actions to eliminate
impediments under specified competition laws without the prior written approval of Parent and (ii) none of Parent, GCP or any of their respective affiliates
or subsidiaries shall be required to take (or, in the case of actions involving the assets, properties or businesses of GCP and its subsidiaries, shall be
permitted to agree to take) any of the foregoing actions to eliminate impediments under specified competition laws (including any sale, transfer, license,
separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control
or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other modification of rights in respect of, any assets, properties or businesses of Parent or GCP or their
respective affiliates or subsidiaries) that is not conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement provides that, during the period commencing at the closing of the Merger and ending on the date that is 12 months following the
closing of the Merger, each employee of GCP and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”) will receive (i)
base salary or wages and a target annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less than the base compensation or wages and target annual cash bonus
opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other compensation and benefits (excluding equity
award compensation and any change in control or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits) that are substantially equivalent in aggregate
economic value to other compensation and benefits (excluding equity award compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time.
The Merger Agreement further provides that the Parent will, or cause its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to assume, honor and
continue during the period ending on the date that is 12 months following the closing of the Merger, or sooner, if all obligations have been satisfied, all of
GCP’s employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements, in each case, disclosed by GCP as
required by the Merger Agreement (including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement), without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with applicable law or as
consented to by the parties to such arrangements.
The Merger Agreement also provides that with respect to the benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation (including any vacation, paid time off and severance plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vesting and benefit accruals, each Continuing Employee’s service with GCP and its subsidiaries, as reflected in GCP’s records, will be treated as service
with Parent or any of its subsidiaries; provided, that such prior service credit shall not be recognized to the extent that it results in a duplication of
benefits, and the foregoing service credit shall not apply with respect to any defined benefit plan. The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent will,
or will cause its subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to (i) waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, evidence
of insurability, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which
Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable GCP benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such

Under the Merger Agreement, beginning at the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of GCP and any contract of GCP and its Subsidiaries, in each case in effect as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, each Indemnitee against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any proceeding or investigation, whether civil or criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever
asserted, arising out of or pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Under the Merger Agreement, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to agree, and the Surviving Corporation agrees, that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger) existing as of the Effective Time in
favor of an Indemnitee as provided in GCP’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational documents shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions in favor of an Indemnitee as
provided in (i) the applicable party’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect as the date of the Merger
Agreement and (ii) any contract of GCP or its subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement with any Indemnitee, and will not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of GCP or its subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such proceeding.
The Merger Agreement provides that, from and for six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be jointly and severally
responsible for maintaining, for the benefit of the directors and officers of GCP as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date of the
Merger, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, that is substantially
equivalent to, and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of GCP. However, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is not available, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an annual premium for the directors and officers insurance in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by GCP prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. If the total premiums payable for such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.
In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each case, Parent will and the Surviving Corporation will, cause proper provision to be made so that the successor
or assign will expressly assume the obligations described above.

The Merger Agreement requires GCP to give Parent reasonable opportunity to consult and participate in the defense or settlement of any proceeding
commenced against GCP and/or its directors and officers relating to
99Table of Contents
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, by or purportedly on behalf of any stockholder of GCP (on their own
behalf or on behalf of GCP) (referred to in this proxy statement as “transaction litigation”). GCP is required to notify Parent of any transaction litigation,
and shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof. GCP may not compromise or settle, or agree to compromise or
settle, any transaction litigation unless Parent provides its prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
For purposes of transaction litigation, “participate” means that Parent is kept reasonably apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions
by GCP with respect to such transaction litigation (to the extent that attorney-client privilege between GCP and its counsel is not impaired; it being
understood that GCP and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to enter into arrangements to avoid impairing privilege), and Parent may offer comments
or suggestions with respect to transaction litigation, but will not be afforded any decision-making power over such transaction litigation prior to the
Effective Time, except for consent right of Parent relating to settlement or compromise as provided above and except that GCP shall take into account
Parent’s recommendations in good faith.
On January 18, 2022, in the United States District Court for the SDNY, an individual complaint was filed by a purported GCP stockholder in connection
with the Merger. A second individual complaint was filed on January 21, 2022 in the SDNY, a third individual complaint was filed on January 28, 2022 in
the SDNY, and a fourth individual complaint was filed on January 29, 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The
complaints are captioned as follows: Stein v. GCP Applied Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00436; and Waterman v. GCP Applied
Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00583; Le v. GCP Applied Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00750; and Newman v. GCP Applied
Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00545. The complaints name as defendants GCP and members of the Board. The complaints generally allege
that the defendants filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC. The alleged omissions relate
to (i) certain financial projections of GCP, (ii) certain financial analyses of RBCCM, and (iii) the amount of certain compensation provided to RBCCM
unrelated to the Merger. The Le complaint also alleges that the sale process leading up to the Merger and the disclosure relating thereto was flawed, and
certain conflicts of interest of GCP’s management in the Merger. The Newman complaint also alleges that the disclosure relating to the sale process
leading up to the Merger was flawed. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, damages,
and other relief.
The defendants believe the claims asserted in these complaints are without merit. Additional lawsuits related to the Merger may be filed in the future.

“Rights Agent”), as further amended by First Amendment, dated March 13, 2020 (the “First Amendment” and, together with the Original Rights
Agreement and the Second Amendment, the “Amended Rights Agreement”). The Second Amendment, which was approved by the Board, renders the
Amended Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger Agreement, the execution thereof, and the performance or consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger. In particular, the Second Amendment provides that none of Saint-Gobain, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of
their respective Affiliates or Associates (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement), either individually or collectively, shall be deemed to be an
Acquiring Person (as defined in the Amended Rights Agreement) as a result of (i) the approval, adoption, execution, delivery and, if applicable, any

of the execution, delivery or performance of the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreements, or the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreements, will result in a Shares Acquisition Date (as defined in the Rights
Agreement) or Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or permit any Rights to be exercised or exchanged pursuant to the Rights
Agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Amended Rights Agreement and the rights issued thereunder will terminate and expire immediately
prior to the Effective Time, but subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time without any payment in respect thereof.

As discussed in “The Merger—Recommendation of Our Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger” on page 47 of this proxy statement, after
considering various factors described in such section, the Board has determined that the Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and advisable and in the best interests of GCP and its stockholders. The Board has unanimously (i)
approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger; (ii) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the Voting Agreements are advisable, fair
to, and in the best interests of, GCP and its stockholders; (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of GCP for its
adoption at the special meeting; and (iv) recommended that GCP’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. The Board recommends that you vote
“FOR” the Merger Proposal. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on the Merger Proposal, your shares of GCP
common stock will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal.
Under Delaware law, adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of GCP common stock
outstanding as of the Record Date and entitled to vote on the matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting. If our stockholders approve the Adjournment
Proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of
proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other
things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against
adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the Merger Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares of GCP common stock to change their votes to votes in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present at the special meeting.
If the special meeting is adjourned, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the vote on the
proposals. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at
the meeting.
Vote Required and Board Recommendation
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of GCP common stock present or represented, in person or
by proxy, at the special meeting and entitled to vote on such matter. Assuming a quorum is present, abstentions as to the Adjournment Proposal will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal and broker non-votes (if any) will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal. If you
sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on the Adjournment Proposal, your shares of GCP common stock will be voted “FOR”
the Adjournment Proposal.
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of GCP and its stockholders to be able to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary
for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in respect of the Merger Proposal if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time
of the special meeting.
In addition, whether or not there is a quorum, the chairman of the meeting or the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all of the shares of GCP
common stock represented at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote, may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time
(subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement).

certain compensation that will or may become payable to the named executive officers of GCP in connection with the Merger, including the agreements
and understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may become payable, the value of which is set forth in “The Merger—Interests of the
Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger—Named Executive Officer Golden Parachute Compensation” on page 67 of this proxy
statement.
The Board encourages you to carefully review the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, GCP is asking its stockholders to vote on the adoption of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to GCP’s named
executive officers in connection with the Merger, including the agreements and understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may
become payable, as disclosed in “The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of GCP in the Merger—Named Executive Officer Golden
Parachute Compensation” in GCP’s proxy statement for the special meeting.”
Stockholders should note that this proposal is separate and apart from Proposal 1 above and is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an
advisory vote, the result will not be binding on GCP, the Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and
not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, our
named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions applicable to those payments.
Vote Required and Board Recommendation
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy
at the special meeting and entitled to vote on such. Assuming a quorum is present, abstentions with respect to the Compensation Proposal will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Compensation Proposal and broker non-votes (if any) will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal. If you

In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by
the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4)
[Repealed.]
(c)
Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
practicable.
(d)
Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1)
If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting
of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares
for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the
shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a
nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall
deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s
shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing
system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation
of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or
vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a
separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not
voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or
(2)
If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each
of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the
merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a
copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such
stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the
date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or
resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic
transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will
be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand
the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not
B-2
Table of Contents
notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second
notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or
resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however,
that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant
to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the
sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has
demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the
transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided,
that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no
record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(e)
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission
directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive
from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other
than any excluded stock (as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or
exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request for
such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file
a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
(f)
Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares
have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition
shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed
for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at
the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
B-3
Table of Contents
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or
such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs
thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.
(g)
At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if
any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger
or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a
national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the
value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h)
After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the
fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together
with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all
relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued,
unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all
proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i)
The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a
corporation of this State or of any state.
(j)
The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value
of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k)
From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d)
of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder
shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the
merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
(l)
The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

holders of any of the following securities:
(a) Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled or converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $32.00 per Share (the “Merger Consideration”),
payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5, upon
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding

connection with the Merger in accordance with this Article 2 (the “Paying Agent”). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the
Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement. In the event such deposited funds are insufficient to make the payments contemplated pursuant to Section 2.1(a), Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to make such
payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
Shares in accordance with this Article 2; provided, however, that any such investments shall be in: (i) obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States
government, (ii) short-term commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively,

most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), or (iv) money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving
Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.
(b) Procedures for Surrender.
(i) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
represented by certificates (the “Certificates”), which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement (other than Section 2.4): (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided
in Section 2.2(e)) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 2.2(e)) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the Paying Agent or such other agent, in accordance with the letter of
transmittal and instructions, shall transmit to the holder of such Certificates the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates representing Dissenting
Shares, which shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and solely to the extent
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.
(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository
A-4
Table of Contents
Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 2.1(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (other than pursuant to Section 2.4) shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5), and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall be
cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry
Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company (other than Company Restricted Stock): (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form as
Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5), and such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall at the Effective Time be
cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed
to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and solely to the extent provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL.
(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Agreement.
(d) Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. Any portion of the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time
will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has
not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(b) prior to such time shall thereafter look
only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger Consideration,
without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5, in respect of such holder’s surrender of
their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b). Any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate
thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates
A-5
Table of Contents
will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable

Days) in contact with the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof for the purpose of informing the
Company Board of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and (y) if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, based on information then available, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, subject to Section 5.3(c), (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to
(but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements (and subject to arrangements that provide for competitively sensitive

promptly as practicable (and in any event within forty-eight hours after such determination) advise Parent if the Company determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.3(b). The foregoing obligations of the
Company shall apply with respect to any amended, revised or subsequent Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to enter into any Contract with any Person that prohibits or otherwise limits the Company from

Proposal and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant to Section

withdrawn and that the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (2) to the extent not previously provided to Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(c) (and without limiting the obligations under Section
5.3(c)), the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the form and amount of consideration offered therein and the identity of
the Person or group making the Acquisition Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided unredacted copies of all Company Acquisition
Agreements and financing commitments (but excluding any fee letters that are customarily redacted with respect thereto)) received by the Company in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, and (3) that, subject to clause (iii) below, the Company Board has determined to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation and/or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) in order to enter into the Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal absent revisions to the terms of this Agreement, as applicable;
(ii) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have, and shall have caused its legal and financial advisors to have, engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any amendment to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and intended to
cause the relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

price terms hereof) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be proposed in writing by Parent (the “Proposed Changed Terms”) no later

continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.
In the event of any revision to the amount or form of consideration or any other material term or condition of such Acquisition Proposal offered in writing
by the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with
all obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.3(d) with respect to each such revision, except that the Notice Period with respect to such
revision shall be two (2) Business Days rather than three (3) Business Days.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), in response to an Intervening Event prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may effect a Change of Board Recommendation only if:

the Company Board’s intention to take such action, which notice shall (i) specify in reasonable detail information describing the underlying material facts

Recommendation absent revisions to the terms of this Agreement and (B) complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.3;
(ii) during the Intervening Event Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have, and shall have caused its legal and financial advisors to
have, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent such that the failure of
the Company Board to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event in accordance with clause (iii) below would no
longer be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and
(iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith the Proposed Changed Terms no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of
the Intervening Event Notice Period and the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to disclose such position would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or otherwise violate applicable Law, it being understood that (i) nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the
Company Board to effect a Change of Board Recommendation other than in accordance with Section 5.3(d) and Section 5.3(e). The issuance by the
Company or the Company Board of a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation.

Parties would, directly or indirectly, beneficially own securities representing 20% or more of the total outstanding voting power of the Company after
giving effect to the consummation of such transaction or series of transactions (other than a transaction or series of transactions that do not change
such Third Party’s or group’s beneficial ownership from before such transaction or series of transactions), (B) any direct or indirect purchase, license,
lease or other acquisition by any Third Party or group of Third Parties of assets of the Company (including Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the
Company) or its Subsidiaries constituting or accounting for 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, based on their fair market value as of the date of such purchase, license, lease or other acquisition of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (C) any direct or indirect acquisition by any Third Party or group of Third Parties, whether from the Company or any other Persons, of

Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) considers in good faith to be appropriate (including the conditionality, timing and likelihood
of consummation of such proposals), (A) is more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company’s stockholders than the Transactions; and (B) is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed.

as promptly as practicable), (iv) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies if necessary in order to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval or (v) if required by specific provision of applicable Law. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company may not, without the prior written

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties in connection with the Merger, including under any Contract to which the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries is party or by
which such Person or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, (ii) obtain all necessary or advisable actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities (including those in connection with applicable Competition Laws), make all
necessary or advisable registrations, declarations and filings with and take all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid
any Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity (including in connection with applicable Competition Laws) in order to consummate the Merger, (iii) resist,
contest or defend any Proceeding (including administrative or judicial Proceedings) challenging the Merger or the completion of the Transactions,
including seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that could restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the Transactions, and (iv) execute and deliver any reasonable
additional instruments consistent with this Agreement that are necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Each of the parties shall furnish to each other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. In furtherance of the foregoing and subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, the Company and Parent shall have the right to review, as far in advance as practicable, all of the information relating to the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, and any of
A-33Table of Contents
their respective affiliates or Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing to be made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall
keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other written substantive communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective affiliates
or Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or Third Party with respect to such transactions, and, to the extent permitted under the circumstances,
shall provide the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to attend and participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates and Subsidiaries to, make or cause to be made all filings required under applicable
Competition Laws with respect to the Merger as promptly as practicable and, in any event, file all required HSR Act pre-merger notifications and report
forms by such time to be mutually agreed in good faith by Parent and the Company in order to cause the expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act to occur as promptly as practicable.
(b) Without limiting this Section 5.5, Parent agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made,
any and all undertakings necessary to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law that may be asserted
by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than
the Outside Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective affiliates or Subsidiaries
or (ii) accepting any operational restrictions or otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit Parent’s, the Company’s or any of their respective
affiliate’s or Subsidiary’s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights, product lines, operations
or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective affiliates or Subsidiaries in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other Order in any suit or Proceeding, which would otherwise have
the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing, as applicable. If such efforts fail to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
applicable Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur, then Parent
shall use its best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring as promptly as practicable (and in
any event, no later than the Outside Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall not take or
agree to take any actions described in this Section 5.5(b) without the prior written approval of Parent and (ii) none of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates or Subsidiaries shall be required to take (or, in the case of actions involving the assets, properties or businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, shall be permitted to agree to take) any action described in this Section 5.5(b) (including any sale, transfer, license, separate holding,
divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full
rights of ownership, or other modification of rights in respect of, any assets, properties or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
affiliates or Subsidiaries) that, in each case, is not conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions.
(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates and Subsidiaries not to: (i) take any action the effect of which, or refrain
from taking any action the effect of refraining from which, would be to delay or impede the ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions beyond
the Outside Date, or (ii) directly or indirectly acquire or agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the
assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into a
definitive agreement relating to, or the
A-34

consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (A) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, in each case by the Outside Date, (B) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity seeking an Order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions by the Outside Date, (C) materially increase the risk of not being
able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise by the Outside Date, or (D) delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions by the Outside
Date.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to take or cause to take any actions described
in this Section 5.5, shall be subject, in each case, to the right of Parent, in Parent’s good faith reasonable discretion, to take reasonable periods of time in
order to advocate and negotiate with Third Parties and Governmental Entities with respect to such actions, provided that such periods of time do not
prevent the parties from consummating the Merger by no later than the Outside Date and (ii) Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all
communications, meetings, negotiations and strategy for dealing with any Governmental Entity, and Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead
the defense strategy for dealing with any administrative or judicial action or proceeding that is initiated or threatened to be initiated challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that are brought by any Governmental Entity or relate to any Competition
Laws; provided that Parent shall consult in good faith with the Company in connection with such control and leadership by Parent and that such control
and leadership do not prevent the consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger
Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger, and nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parent’s or Merger Sub’s operations prior to the consummation
of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this

cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each a “Continuing Employee”), during any period of employment with the Surviving Corporation following the Closing, (i) base

harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under (i) applicable Law, (ii) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws

pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in

date of this Agreement, it being understood that if the total premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to
have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies do not exceed 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement and provide such directors and officers with such coverage for an aggregate
period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of this Agreement
or the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be permitted, at its sole
discretion, to obtain such prepaid policies that provide such coverage prior to the Effective Time.

made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The obligations of Parent under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).
(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims
under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification or advancement of expenses provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in

Obligations. Guarantor agrees that the obligations of Guarantor under this Section 8.13 shall be valid and enforceable and Guarantor hereby waives (i)

any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist
and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this

injunctive relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and the necessity of

waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or
damages incurred or suffered by the other party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving a Willful and Material Breach. If Parent has
committed a Willful and Material Breach of its obligation to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date and, prior to the termination of this Agreement,
the Company has sought an order of specific performance from a court of competent jurisdiction to cause Parent to comply with its obligation to
consummate the Merger and such court has determined that the remedy of specific performance is unavailable to cause Parent to comply with its
obligation to consummate the Merger, then, following termination of this Agreement, the remedy of monetary damages (if any) may take into account the
lost benefit of the bargain; provided however, that, in the case of the grant of any monetary award by a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of the
Company as a result of a Willful and Material Breach by Parent of its obligation to consummate the Merger, the Company may enforce such award and
accept such monetary payment only if, following such grant of monetary award, the Company shall have offered and committed to complete the Merger
and Parent and Merger Sub shall have not consummated the Merger within two (2) weeks of such offer; provided further that, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, dismiss with prejudice any Proceedings still pending at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger.",190,190
