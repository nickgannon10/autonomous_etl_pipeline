DUKE REALTY CORP_20220802_DEFM14A_20251209_4495981.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following are answers to some questions that Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders may
have regarding the proposed combination of Prologis and Duke Realty. Prologis and Duke Realty urge you to
read carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the Annexes, and the documents
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, because the information in this section
does not provide all the information that might be important to you.
What is the proposed transaction?
Prologis and Duke Realty have entered into a merger agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Prologis will acquire Duke Realty in three steps: (i)
first, in the company merger, Duke Realty will merge with and into Prologis Merger Sub, with Prologis
Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis, (ii) thereafter,
in the contribution and issuance, Prologis and Prologis Merger Sub will cause all the outstanding equity
interests of Prologis Merger Sub to be contributed to Prologis OP in exchange for the issuance by
Prologis OP of Prologis OP common units to Prologis and/or its subsidiaries as directed by Prologis, and
(iii) thereafter, in the partnership merger, Prologis OP Merger Sub will merge with and into Duke Realty
OP, with Duke Realty OP continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis
OP.
What will happen in the proposed transaction?
At the company merger effective time, each issued and outstanding share of Duke Realty common stock
as of immediately before the company merger effective time will be automatically converted into the
right to receive the merger consideration, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares (the “fractional
share consideration”), without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
merger agreement.
At the partnership merger effective time, (i) each membership interest of Prologis OP Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time will be converted into and
become one new validly issued Duke Realty OP common unit, (ii) the general partner interests in Duke
Realty OP as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time will remain general partnership
interests in Duke Realty OP, (iii) each Duke Realty OP common unit that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other than any Duke Realty OP common units
as described in clauses (iv) and (v) below) will automatically be converted into 0.475 of a new validly
issued Prologis OP common unit, and each holder of Duke Realty OP common units will be admitted as a
limited partner of Prologis OP in accordance with the terms of the Prologis OP partnership agreement,
(iv) each Duke Realty OP common unit owned by Prologis Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the
partnership merger effective time will remain outstanding at and following the partnership merger
effective time, and (v) each Duke Realty OP common unit owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of
Prologis Merger Sub or of Duke Realty OP, in each case, as of immediately prior to the partnership
merger effective time, will be canceled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange therefor. No fractional new Prologis OP common units will be issued in the partnership merger.
Any fractional new Prologis OP common unit that would otherwise be issued to any holder of Duke
Realty OP common units will be rounded up to the nearest whole number, and the holders of Duke
Realty OP common units will not be entitled to any further consideration with respect thereto.

detailed descriptions of the merger consideration and treatment of securities. See also “The Merger
Agreement - Merger Consideration; Effects of the Mergers - Duke Realty Equity-Based Awards”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if the company merger is not completed?
If the company merger is not completed for any reason, Duke Realty shareholders will not have their
shares of Duke Realty common stock exchanged for the merger consideration. Instead, each of Prologis
and Duke Realty would remain a separate company.
What happens if the market price of shares of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock changes
before the closing of the mergers?
No change will be made to the exchange ratio of 0.475 if the market price of shares of Prologis common
stock or Duke Realty common stock changes before the mergers. As a result, the market value of the
consideration to be received by Duke Realty shareholders in the company merger and Duke Realty OP
unitholders in the partnership merger will increase or decrease depending on the market price of shares
of Prologis common stock at the effective time of the mergers.
Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?
Each of the Prologis board and the Duke Realty board is using this joint proxy statement/prospectus to
solicit proxies of Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders, as applicable, in connection with
seeking approval of the merger agreement, the company merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. In addition, Prologis is using this joint proxy statement/​prospectus as a
prospectus for Duke Realty shareholders because Prologis is offering shares of Prologis common stock
to be issued in connection with the company merger. The mergers cannot be completed unless the
holders of Prologis common stock vote to approve the Prologis common stock issuance proposal and
the holders of Duke Realty common stock vote to approve the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal.
Prologis and Duke Realty will each hold a meeting of its stockholders and shareholders, respectively, to
obtain such approval and to consider other proposals as described elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.
This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the company merger and
the other proposals being voted on at the Prologis special meeting and the Duke Realty special meeting
and you should read it carefully. The enclosed voting materials allow you to vote your Prologis common
stock or Duke Realty common stock, as applicable, without attending the special meeting.
Your vote is important. You are encouraged to submit your proxy as promptly as possible.
Am I being asked to vote on any other proposals at the special meetings in addition to the Prologis common stock
issuance proposal or the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal, as applicable?
At the Prologis special meeting, Prologis stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the
following additional proposal:
the Prologis adjournment proposal - a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Prologis
special meeting to another date, time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the Prologis common stock issuance proposal.
At the Duke Realty special meeting, Duke Realty shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon
the following additional proposals:
the Duke Realty compensation proposal - a non-binding advisory proposal to approve the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Duke Realty in
connection with the company merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement; and
the Duke Realty adjournment proposal - a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the
Duke Realty special meeting to another date, time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Why are Prologis and Duke Realty proposing the mergers?
Among other reasons, because if completed, the mergers are expected to provide a number of significant
potential strategic opportunities and benefits, including combining two highly complementary
portfolios, allowing the Combined Company to capture significant cost and revenue synergies while
offering its customers more choice, flexibility and product offerings as a result of the combined
portfolios. To review the reasons of the Prologis board for the mergers in greater detail, see “The
Mergers - Recommendation of the Prologis Board of Directors and Its Reasons for the Mergers”
beginning on page 67. To review the reasons of the Duke Realty board for the mergers in greater detail,
see “The Mergers - Recommendation of the Duke Realty Board of Directors and Its Reasons for the
Mergers” beginning on page 70.
Who will be the board of directors and management of the Combined Company?
The merger agreement provides that Prologis will take all actions necessary to add Duke Realty’s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James B. Connor, to the Prologis board at the company merger
effective time. Except for the addition of Mr. Connor to the Prologis board, there will be no change to
the members of the Prologis board as a result of the mergers, and the directors of Prologis as of
immediately prior to the company merger effective time, together with Mr. Connor, will continue to serve
as the directors of the Combined Company. Hamid R. Moghadam will continue to serve as Prologis’
Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Prologis board.
The executive officers of Prologis immediately prior to the company merger effective time will continue
to serve as the executive officers of the Combined Company, with Hamid R. Moghadam continuing to
serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Combined Company.
Will Prologis and Duke Realty continue to pay dividends or distributions prior to the closing of the mergers?
Yes.
The merger agreement permits Prologis to pay, subject to certain other exceptions related to preferred
stock and dividends and distributions that are reasonably necessary to maintain its REIT qualification
and/or avoid the imposition of United States federal income or excise tax, (i) regular quarterly cash
distributions at a quarterly rate not to exceed $0.79 per share of Prologis common stock, except that the
Prologis board may increase such dividend by no more than 15%, (ii) dividends pursuant to the terms of
the series Q preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Prologis, (iii) regular distributions that are
required to be made in respect of the Prologis OP common units in connection with any dividends paid
on the Prologis common stock, and (iv) distributions that are required to be made in respect of the
Prologis OP preferred units and Prologis Class A convertible common units under the Prologis OP
partnership agreement.
The merger agreement permits Duke Realty to pay, subject to certain other exceptions related to
dividends and distributions that are reasonably necessary to maintain its REIT qualification and/or
avoid the imposition of United States federal income or excise tax, (i) regular quarterly cash distributions
at a quarterly rate not to exceed $0.28 per share of Duke Realty common stock, provided that if the
Prologis board increases its regular quarterly cash distributions (by not more than 15%), then Duke
Realty will be permitted to make a corresponding increase (of not more than 15%) in its regular dividend
for the same quarterly period, and (ii) regular distributions that are required to be made in respect of the
Duke Realty OP common units in connection with any dividends paid on the Duke Realty common
stock.
Duke Realty has agreed that the record and payment dates for its quarterly dividends will be set to be
the same dates as those of Prologis. Without limiting the foregoing, the timing of quarterly dividends
will be coordinated by Prologis and Duke Realty so that if either Prologis stockholders or Duke Realty
shareholders receive a dividend for any particular quarter between January 1, 2022, and the partnership
merger effective time, the stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, of the other entity will also
receive a dividend for that quarter between January 1, 2022 and the partnership merger effective time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
How does each of the Prologis board and the Duke Realty board recommend that Prologis stockholders and Duke
Realty shareholders, respectively, vote on the proposals?
Each of the Prologis board and Duke Realty board has unanimously approved the merger agreement, the
mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The Prologis board recommends that Prologis stockholders vote FOR the Prologis common stock
issuance proposal and FOR the Prologis adjournment proposal. For a more complete description of the
recommendation of the Prologis board, see “The Mergers - Recommendation of the Prologis Board of
Directors and Its Reasons for the Mergers” beginning on page 67.
The Duke Realty board recommends that Duke Realty shareholders vote FOR the Duke Realty merger
agreement proposal, FOR the Duke Realty compensation proposal and FOR the Duke Realty
adjournment proposal. For a more complete description of the recommendation of the Duke Realty
board, see “The Mergers - Recommendation of the Duke Realty Board of Directors and Its Reasons for
the Mergers” beginning on page 70.
Do any of Duke Realty’s named executive officers or directors have interests in the mergers that may differ from
those of Duke Realty shareholders?
Certain of Duke Realty’s named executive officers and directors have interests in the mergers that are
different from, or in addition to, their interests as Duke Realty shareholders. The members of the Duke
Realty board were aware of and considered such Duke Realty named executive officers’ and directors’
interests, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement and the mergers, and in
recommending that Duke Realty shareholders vote FOR the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal.
For a description of these interests, see the section entitled “The Mergers - Interests of Duke Realty’s
Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Mergers” beginning on page 98.
Are there any conditions to closing of the mergers that must be satisfied for the mergers to be completed?
In addition to the approval of the Prologis stockholders of the Prologis common stock issuance
proposal and the approval of the Duke Realty shareholders of the Duke Realty merger agreement
proposal, there are a number of customary conditions that must be satisfied or waived for the mergers to
be consummated. For a description of all the conditions to the mergers, see “The Merger Agreement - 
Conditions to Completion of the Mergers” beginning on page 134.
Are there risks associated with the mergers that I should consider in deciding how to vote?
Yes. There are a number of risks related to the mergers that are discussed in this joint proxy statement/​
prospectus described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 28.
If I do not vote for a proposal, what effect will that have?
If you are a Prologis stockholder, failure to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect
on the Prologis common stock issuance proposal or the Prologis adjournment proposal, in each case
assuming a quorum is present.
If you are a Duke Realty shareholder, failure to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the
same effect as votes AGAINST the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal. Failure to vote, abstentions
and broker non-votes will have no effect on the Duke Realty compensation proposal or the Duke Realty
adjournment proposal, in each case assuming a quorum is present.
Will my rights as a stockholder of Prologis change as a result of the mergers?
No. The governing documents of Prologis that are in effect immediately prior to the company merger
effective time will remain in effect following the company merger effective time. Therefore, the rights of
legacy Prologis stockholders will not change as a result of the mergers, except insofar as such
stockholders face a risk of dilution, as described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on
page 28.

fourth quarter of 2022. However, there is no guarantee that the conditions to the mergers will be
satisfied or that the mergers will close.
What are the material United States federal income tax consequences to United States holders of the mergers?
The company merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. Assuming that the company merger qualifies as a reorganization, United States holders (as
defined in the discussion under the heading “The Mergers - Material United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Company Merger”) of shares of Duke Realty common stock generally will not
recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes upon the receipt of Prologis
common stock in exchange for shares of Duke Realty common stock in connection with the company
merger, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Prologis common stock.
Holders of shares of Duke Realty common stock should read the discussion under the heading “The
Mergers - Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Company Merger” beginning
on page 104 and consult their tax advisors to determine the tax consequences to them (including the
application and effect of any state, local or non-United States income and other tax laws) of the mergers.
What happens if the Duke Realty compensation proposal is not approved?
Approval of the Duke Realty compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the mergers.
Because the vote regarding merger-related compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on
either Duke Realty or Prologis regardless of whether the mergers are completed. Accordingly, if the
mergers are completed, the merger-related compensation will become payable in connection with the
mergers and, if applicable, a qualifying termination of employment, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the non-binding advisory proposal.
Are Prologis stockholders or Duke Realty shareholders entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights?
No. Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders are not entitled to exercise appraisal or
dissenters’ rights in connection with the mergers. See “The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration;
Effects of the Mergers - Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 115 for more information.

represented by properly completed proxies received prior to the Prologis special meeting or the Duke
Realty special meeting, respectively, and not revoked, will be voted at such applicable special meeting
as instructed on the proxies. If you properly sign, date and return a proxy card, but do not indicate how

completion of the mergers, the exchange agent will send you instructions for exchanging Duke Realty
stock certificates for the merger consideration.
What should I do if I hold my shares of Duke Realty common stock in book-entry form?
You are not required to take any special additional actions if your shares of Duke Realty common stock

Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
Yes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
Prologis special meeting or the Duke Realty special meeting, as applicable. If you are a holder of record,
you can do this in any of the three following ways:

before the Prologis special meeting or the Duke Realty special meeting, as applicable, or by
submitting a later-dated proxy by telephone or via the Internet, in which case your later-dated proxy
will be recorded and your earlier proxy revoked; or
by virtually attending the Prologis special meeting or the Duke Realty special meeting, as applicable,

You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the Prologis special meeting or the Duke
Realty special meeting, as applicable, including multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your Prologis common
stock or Duke Realty common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate
voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold your Prologis common stock or
Duke Realty common stock, as applicable. If you are a holder of record and your Prologis common stock

the Prologis special meeting and Duke Realty special meeting, respectively. Prologis estimates it will pay

Duke Realty’s respective directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by

Prologis was formed in 1997 and is a global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high growth
markets. Prologis owns, manages and develops well-located, high-quality logistics facilities in 19 countries
across four continents. Prologis’ teams actively manage its portfolio to provide comprehensive real estate
services, including leasing, property management, development, acquisitions and dispositions. Prologis
invests significant capital each year into new logistics properties principally through our development
activity and third-party acquisitions. Prologis’ property dispositions allow Prologis to recycle capital and
contribute to self-funding these development and acquisition activities. The majority of Prologis’ properties
in the U.S. are wholly owned, while its properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment
ventures to mitigate Prologis’ exposure to foreign currency movements.
Prologis commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997, elected to be taxed as a

In considering the recommendation of the Duke Realty board to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the company merger, Duke Realty
shareholders should be aware that Duke Realty directors and executive officers have interests in the
company merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Duke Realty shareholders
generally, including potential severance benefits, treatment of outstanding Duke Realty equity-based awards
in connection with the company merger, rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage, and, in
the case of Mr. Connor, expected appointment to the Prologis board. The Duke Realty board was aware of
these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger
agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement (including the company merger), and in recommending to Duke Realty shareholders
that the merger agreement be approved.

Expected Timing of the Merger
The parties expect the mergers to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. Neither Duke Realty nor
Prologis can predict the actual date on which the mergers will be completed, or if the mergers will be
completed at all, because completion of the mergers is subject to conditions and factors outside of the

with the company merger by the Prologis stockholders, the approval of the merger agreement by the Duke
Realty shareholders and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions.

Prologis has agreed to pay to Duke Realty all documented reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees
and expenses of counsel and other advisors) paid or payable by any of the Duke Realty parties in
connection with the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement up
to a maximum of $15 million if the merger agreement is terminated by either Duke Realty or Prologis because
of the failure to obtain Prologis stockholder approval (or if the merger agreement is terminated by either Duke
Realty or Prologis because the Duke Realty shareholders failed to approve the merger agreement at the Duke
Realty special meeting when either party could have terminated the merger agreement because the Prologis
stockholders failed to approve the Prologis common stock issuance at the Prologis special meeting). Any
such amount paid by Prologis would be credited against the payment of any termination fee that Prologis
subsequently becomes obligated to pay Duke Realty.

On July 26, 2022, Prologis and the Prologis board were sued in a putative class action lawsuit, captioned
Stephen Bushansky v. Prologis, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:22-cv-04320 (the “Bushansky Action”), filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in connection with the proposed merger
between Duke Realty and Prologis and the related Form S-4. The complaint in the Bushansky Action alleges
that Prologis and the Prologis board violated federal securities laws by omitting or misstating material
information in the Form S-4, rendering the Form S-4 materially deficient. On July 27, 2022, Duke Realty and
the Duke Realty board were sued in a lawsuit, captioned Shiva Stein v. Duke Realty Corporation et al., Case
No. 1:22-cv-06387 (the “Stein Action”), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, in connection with the proposed merger between Duke Realty and Prologis and the related Form S-

Duke Realty Corporation et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-06425 (the “O’Dell Action”), filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in connection with the proposed merger between Duke
Realty and Prologis and the related Form S-4. The complaints in the Stein and O’Dell Actions allege that
Duke Realty and the Duke Realty board violated federal securities laws by omitting or misstating material
information in the Form S-4, rendering the Form S-4 materially deficient. The Plaintiffs in the Bushansky,
Stein and O’Dell Actions seek, among other things, (i) to enjoin the transaction until the alleged deficiencies
in the Form S-4 are corrected, and (ii) attorneys’ and experts’ fees and costs in connection with the lawsuit. If
additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, neither Prologis
nor Duke Realty will necessarily announce such additional filings.
Although the ultimate outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, Prologis and Duke Realty
believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend against these actions vigorously.",37,37

Prologis and Duke Realty intend that the company merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning

In addition to the other information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters
addressed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” you
should carefully consider the following risks before deciding how to vote your shares of Prologis common
stock or Duke Realty common stock. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with
each of the businesses of Prologis and Duke Realty because these risks will also affect the Combined
Company. These risks can be found in the respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Prologis and Duke Realty, each of
which is filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You
should also read and consider the other information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other
documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find

The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the stock prices of either Prologis
or Duke Realty.
Upon the closing of the company merger, each outstanding share of Duke Realty common stock (other than
shares of Duke Realty common stock owned by any of the Duke Realty parties or any wholly owned
subsidiary of Duke Realty and each share of Duke Realty common stock owned by any of the Prologis
parties or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive 0.475
of a share of Prologis common stock, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares, without interest. The
exchange ratio of 0.475 was fixed in the merger agreement and, except for certain adjustments on account of
changes in the capitalization of Prologis or Duke Realty, will not be adjusted for changes in the market prices
of shares of either Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock. Changes in the market price of
shares of Prologis common stock prior to the closing of the company merger will affect the market value of
the merger consideration that Duke Realty shareholders will be entitled to receive upon completion of the
company merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond the
control of either Prologis or Duke Realty), including the following factors:
market reaction to the announcement of the mergers and the prospects of the Combined Company;
changes in the respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities and prospects of Prologis, Duke
Realty or the Combined Company;
changes in market assessments of the business, operations, financial position and prospects of
Prologis, Duke Realty or the Combined Company;
market assessments of the likelihood that the mergers will close;
interest rates (including changes or anticipated changes in interest rates), general market and
economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the market prices of Prologis common stock
and Duke Realty common stock;
federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses
in which Prologis or Duke Realty operate; and
other factors beyond the control of either Prologis or Duke Realty, including those described or
referred to elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section.
The market price of shares of Prologis common stock at the closing of the mergers may vary from its price on
the date the merger agreement was executed, on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, on the
date of the Prologis special meeting and on the date of the Duke Realty special meeting. As a result, the
market value of the merger consideration represented by the exchange ratio will also vary. For example, based
on the range of trading prices of shares of Prologis common stock during the period after June 10, 2022, the
last trading day before Duke Realty and Prologis announced the merger agreement, through July 26, 2022,
the exchange ratio represented a market value ranging from $50.57 to $61.16 per share.
28 TABLE OF CONTENTS
If the market price of shares of Prologis common stock increases between the date the merger agreement was
signed, the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Prologis special meeting or the date
of the Duke Realty special meeting and the date of the closing of the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders
could receive shares of Prologis common stock that have a market value upon completion of the mergers that
is greater than the market value of such shares calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the
merger agreement was signed, the date of the joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Prologis
special meeting or the date of the Duke Realty special meeting, respectively. Conversely, if the market price
of shares of Prologis common stock declines between the date the merger agreement was signed, the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Prologis special meeting or the date of the Duke Realty
special meeting and the closing of the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders could receive shares of Prologis
common stock that have a market value upon the closing of the mergers that is less than the market value of
such shares calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the merger agreement was signed, the date
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Prologis special meeting or the date of the Duke
Realty special meeting, respectively. Furthermore, at the time of the Prologis special meeting and the Duke
Realty special meeting, Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders will not know with certainty the
value of the Prologis common stock that Duke Realty shareholders will receive upon completion of the
mergers.
Therefore, while the number of shares of Prologis common stock to be issued per share of Duke Realty
common stock is fixed, Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders cannot be sure of the market
value of the merger consideration Duke Realty shareholders will receive upon the closing of the mergers.
Holders of Prologis common stock and Duke Realty common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting
interest in the Combined Company after the mergers and will exercise less influence over management.
The mergers will result in Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders having an ownership stake in
the Combined Company that is smaller than their current stake in Prologis and Duke Realty, respectively, as
of immediately prior to the mergers. Upon completion of the mergers, based on the number of shares of
Prologis common stock and Duke Realty common stock outstanding on June 30, 2022, we estimate that
continuing Prologis stockholders will own approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding common stock
of the Combined Company, and former Duke Realty shareholders will own approximately 20% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of the Combined Company. Consequently, Prologis stockholders and Duke
Realty shareholders, as a general matter, will have less influence over the management and policies of the
Combined Company after the company merger effective time than they currently exercise over the
management and policies of Prologis and Duke Realty, respectively.
Completion of the mergers is subject to many conditions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the
mergers will not be completed, which could result in a requirement that Prologis or Duke Realty pay certain
termination fees.
The consummation of the mergers is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the approval of the merger
agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duke Realty common stock entitled to
vote on such matter, (ii) the approval of the Prologis common stock issuance by the holders of a majority of
votes cast on such matter, (iii) the shares of Prologis common stock to be issued in the company merger
having been approved for listing on the NYSE, (iv) the Form S-4 (of which this joint proxy statement/​
prospectus forms a part) having been declared effective, (v) the absence of any temporary restraining order,
injunction or other order, decree or judgment being issued by any governmental authority and no law being
enacted, which would have the effect of making illegal or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
mergers, (vi) the receipt of certain legal opinions by Prologis and Duke Realty and (vii) other customary
conditions specified in the merger agreement. See “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to Completion of the
Mergers” beginning on page 134.
There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the mergers will be satisfied or waived or
that the mergers will be completed. Failure to consummate the mergers may adversely affect Prologis’ or
Duke Realty’s results of operations and business prospects for the following reasons, among others: (i) each
of Prologis and Duke Realty have incurred and will incur certain transaction costs, regardless of whether the
proposed mergers close, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and
ability
29

TABLE OF CONTENTS
to make distributions to its stockholders or shareholders, respectively; and (ii) the proposed mergers,
whether or not they close, will divert the attention of certain of each of Prologis’ and Duke Realty’s
management and other key employees from ongoing business activities, including the pursuit of other
opportunities that could be beneficial to Prologis and Duke Realty, respectively. In addition, Duke Realty or
Prologis may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if
the mergers are not completed by January 11, 2023.
If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Prologis
may be required to pay Duke Realty a termination fee of $1.5 billion and/or reimburse Duke Realty’s
transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million, or Duke Realty may be required to pay Prologis a
termination fee of $775 million and/or reimburse Prologis’ transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15
million. If the mergers are not consummated, the price of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common
stock might decline.
Failure to complete the mergers could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial
results of Prologis or Duke Realty.
If the mergers are not completed, the ongoing business of Prologis or Duke Realty could be materially
adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the mergers, Prologis and
Duke Realty will be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the mergers, including
the following:
the market price of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock could decline;
Prologis being required, under certain circumstances, to pay to Duke Realty a termination fee of $1.5
billion depending on the circumstances and/or reimburse Duke Realty’s reasonable expenses up to
$15 million or Duke Realty being required, under certain circumstances, to pay to Prologis a
termination fee of $775 million depending on the circumstances and/or reimburse Prologis’ reasonable
expenses up to $15 million, as applicable;
if the merger agreement is terminated and the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board seeks another
business combination, Prologis stockholders or Duke Realty shareholders, respectively, cannot be
certain that Prologis or Duke Realty, respectively, will be able to find a party willing to enter into a
transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Prologis and Duke Realty
have agreed to in the merger agreement;
Prologis or Duke Realty may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or its tenants,
vendors or employees;
Prologis or Duke Realty having to pay certain costs relating to the mergers, such as legal, accounting,
financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees whether or not the mergers are completed; and
diversion of Prologis’ or Duke Realty’s management focus and resources from operational matters and
other strategic opportunities while working to implement the mergers.
If the mergers are not completed, these risks could materially affect the business, financial results and share
price of Prologis or Duke Realty. In addition, if the mergers are not completed, Prologis or Duke Realty could
be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the mergers or related to any enforcement
proceeding commenced against Prologis or Duke Realty to perform its obligations under the merger
agreement. The materialization of any of these risks could adversely impact Prologis’ or Duke Realty’s
ongoing business.
The pendency of the mergers could adversely affect the business and operations of Prologis or Duke Realty.
Prior to the effective time of the mergers, some tenants, prospective tenants or vendors of Prologis or Duke
Realty may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively affect the revenues, earnings, cash flows and
expenses of Prologis or Duke Realty, regardless of whether the mergers are completed. Similarly, current and
prospective employees of Duke Realty may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the
Combined Company following the mergers, which may materially adversely affect the ability of Duke Realty
to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the mergers. In addition, due to operating
30 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
restrictions in the merger agreement, Prologis and Duke Realty may be unable, during the pendency of the
mergers, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant
financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions, even if such actions would prove beneficial.
The merger agreement contains provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire all or a significant
portion of Prologis or Duke Realty prior to the mergers.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, each of Prologis and Duke Realty has agreed not to (i) solicit proposals
relating to certain alternative transactions, (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations or provide non-public
information in connection with any proposal for an alternative transaction from a third party or (iii) approve
or enter into any agreements providing for any such alternative transaction, in each case, subject to certain
exceptions to permit members of the Prologis board and the Duke Realty board to comply with their duties as
directors under applicable law. Notwithstanding these “no-shop” restrictions, prior to obtaining the Prologis
stockholder approval or the Duke Realty shareholder approval, as applicable, under specified circumstances
the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, respectively, may change its recommendation of the
transaction, and Duke Realty may also terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal upon
payment of the termination fee described below.
The merger agreement provides that, in connection with the termination of the merger agreement under
specified circumstances, Prologis may be required to pay to Duke Realty a termination fee of $1.5 billion
and/or reimburse Duke Realty’s transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million and Duke Realty
may be required to pay to Prologis a termination fee of $775 million and/or reimburse Prologis’ transaction
expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million. See “The Merger Agreement -  Covenants and Agreements - 
No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals” and “The Merger Agreement -  Termination of the Merger
Agreement - Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 138.
These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all
or a significant part of Prologis or Duke Realty from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if
the potential competing acquirer was prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share value than the
value proposed to be received or realized in the mergers, or might result in a potential competing acquirer
proposing to pay a lower per share value than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added
expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances under the merger
agreement.
If the merger agreement is terminated and Prologis or Duke Realty determines to seek another business
combination, Prologis or Duke Realty, respectively, may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another
party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the mergers contemplated by the merger agreement.
If the mergers are not consummated by January 11, 2023, either Prologis or Duke Realty may terminate the merger
agreement.
Either Prologis or Duke Realty may terminate the merger agreement if the mergers have not been
consummated by January 11, 2023. However, this termination right will not be available to a party if that party
failed to comply with the merger agreement and that failure was the primary cause of, or resulted in, the
failure to consummate the mergers on or before January 11, 2023. See “The Merger Agreement -  Termination
of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 136.
Some of the directors and named executive officers of Duke Realty have interests in the mergers that are different
from, or in addition to, those of the other Duke Realty shareholders.
In considering whether to approve the merger agreement and the transasctions contemplated thereby,
including the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders should recognize that members of management and the
Duke Realty board have interests in the mergers that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of other
Duke Realty shareholders. Some of the directors and named executive officers of Duke Realty have
arrangements that provide them with interests in the mergers that are different from, or in addition to, those
generally of the Duke Realty shareholders. These interests, among other things, may influence or may have
influenced the directors and named executive officers of Duke Realty to support or approve the merger
31 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
agreement. See “The Mergers - Interests of Duke Realty’s Directors and Named Executive Officers in the
Mergers” beginning on page 98.
If the company merger does not qualify as a reorganization, there may be adverse tax consequences.
The company merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that Prologis and Duke Realty receive written
opinions from their respective counsel to the effect that the company merger will qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The foregoing opinions, however, are limited to the factual
representations provided by Prologis and Duke Realty to counsel and the assumptions set forth therein, and
are not a guarantee that the company merger, in fact, will qualify as a reorganization. Moreover, neither Duke
Realty nor Prologis has requested or plans to request a ruling from the IRS that the company merger qualifies
as a reorganization. If the company merger were to fail to qualify as a reorganization, then each United States
holder (as defined in the discussion under the heading “The Mergers - Material United States Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Company Merger”) of shares of Duke Realty common stock generally
would recognize gain or loss, as applicable, equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair market
value of the shares of Prologis common stock received by such holder in the company merger; and (ii) such
holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Duke Realty common stock.
In connection with the announcement of the merger agreement, three lawsuits have been filed and are pending as of
July 31, 2022, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the mergers until alleged deficiencies in the Form S-4 are
corrected. An injunction or other adverse ruling being entered in any of these lawsuits may prevent the mergers from
being effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.
On July 26, 2022, Prologis and the Prologis board were sued in a putative class action lawsuit, captioned
Stephen Bushansky v. Prologis, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:22-cv-04320 (the “Bushansky Action”), filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in connection with the proposed merger
between Duke Realty and Prologis and the related Form S-4. The complaint in the Bushansky Action alleges
that Prologis and the Prologis board violated federal securities laws by omitting or misstating material
information in the Form S-4, rendering the Form S-4 materially deficient. On July 27, 2022, Duke Realty and
the Duke Realty board were sued in a lawsuit, captioned Shiva Stein v. Duke Realty Corporation et al., Case
No. 1:22-cv-06387 (the “Stein Action”), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, in connection with the proposed merger between Duke Realty and Prologis and the related Form S-
4. On July 28, 2022, Duke Realty and the Duke Realty board were sued in a lawsuit, captioned Ryan O’Dell v.
Duke Realty Corporation et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-06425 (the “O’Dell Action”), filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in connection with the proposed merger between Duke
Realty and Prologis and the related Form S-4. The complaints in the Stein and O’Dell Actions allege that
Duke Realty and the Duke Realty board violated federal securities laws by omitting or misstating material
information in the Form S-4, rendering the Form S-4 materially deficient. The Plaintiffs in the Bushansky,
Stein and O’Dell Actions seek, among other things, (i) to enjoin the transaction until the alleged deficiencies
in the Form S-4 are corrected, and (ii) attorneys' and experts' fees and costs in connection with the lawsuit. If
additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, neither Prologis
nor Duke Realty will necessarily announce such additional filings.
While Prologis and Duke Realty management believe that the allegations in these complaints are without
merit and intend to defend vigorously against these allegations, we cannot assure you as to the outcome of
these or similar future lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending these claims or any other
liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of these claims. For more

The Combined Company expects to incur substantial expenses related to the mergers.
The Combined Company expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with completing the mergers
and integrating the operations and systems of Duke Realty with those of Prologis. While Prologis
32 • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond its
control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the Combined Company’s expenses relating to the
completion of the mergers and the Combined Company’s operations. Many of the expenses that will be
incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. As a result, the expenses
associated with the mergers could, particularly in the near term, reduce the savings that the Combined
Company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of
scale and cost savings related to the integration of the operations of Duke Realty following the completion
of the mergers.
Following the mergers, the Combined Company may be unable to integrate the operations of Prologis and Duke
Realty successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the mergers or do so within the
anticipated time frame.
The mergers involve the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public
companies and their respective operating partnerships. The Combined Company is expected to benefit from
the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting a public company platform and the
leveraging of state-of-the-art technology and systems. However, the Combined Company will be required to
devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the operations of Prologis and Duke
Realty. Potential difficulties the Combined Company may encounter in the integration process include the
following:
the inability to successfully combine the operations of Prologis and Duke Realty in a manner that
permits the Combined Company to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the mergers,
which would result in the anticipated benefits of the mergers not being realized in the time frame
currently anticipated or at all;
the inability to dispose of former Duke Realty assets or operations that the Combined Company
desires to dispose of;
potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions
associated with the mergers; and
performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing
the mergers and integrating the companies’ operations.
For all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the
distraction of the Combined Company’s management, the disruption of the Combined Company’s ongoing
business or inconsistencies in the Combined Company’s operations, services, standards, controls,
procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the Combined Company to
maintain relationships with tenants, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the
mergers, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the Combined Company.
The Combined Company’s anticipated level of indebtedness may increase upon completion of the mergers and may
increase the related risks Prologis now faces.
In connection with the mergers, the Combined Company may assume and/or refinance certain indebtedness
of Duke Realty and Duke Realty OP and, as a result, may be subject to increased risks associated with debt
financing. On March 31, 2022, Prologis had indebtedness of approximately $18.4 billion. After giving effect to
the mergers, the Combined Company’s total pro forma consolidated indebtedness will increase. Taking into
account Prologis’ existing indebtedness and the assumption of Duke Realty’s debt in the mergers, the
Combined Company’s pro forma consolidated indebtedness as of March 31, 2022, after giving effect to the
mergers, would be approximately $21.6 billion.
The Combined Company’s increased indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of its
common stock, including Duke Realty shareholders that receive Prologis common stock in the company
merger, including:
increasing the Combined Company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
conditions;
33 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
limiting the Combined Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital,
capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; and
limiting the Combined Company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business
and its industry.
If the Combined Company defaults under a mortgage loan, it will automatically be in default under any other
loan that has cross-default provisions, and it may lose the properties securing these loans. Although the
Combined Company anticipates that it will pay off its mortgage payables as soon as prepayment penalties
and other costs make it economically feasible to do so, the Combined Company cannot anticipate when such
payment will occur.
The future results of the Combined Company will suffer if the Combined Company does not effectively manage its
expanded operations following the mergers.
Following the mergers, the Combined Company expects to continue to expand its operations through
additional acquisitions and development of properties, some of which may involve complex challenges. The
future success of the Combined Company will depend, in part, upon the ability of the Combined Company to
manage its expansion opportunities, which may pose substantial challenges for the Combined Company to
integrate new operations into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, and upon its ability to
successfully monitor its operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and to maintain other
necessary internal controls. There is no assurance that the Combined Company’s expansion or acquisition
opportunities will be successful, or that the Combined Company will realize its expected operating
efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits.
Counterparties to certain significant agreements with Duke Realty may exercise contractual rights under such
agreements in connection with the mergers.
Duke Realty is a party to certain agreements that give the counterparty certain rights following a “change in
control,” including in some cases the right to terminate the agreement. Under some such agreements, the
mergers may constitute a change in control, and therefore the counterparty may exercise certain rights under
the agreement upon the closing of the mergers. Any such counterparty may request modifications of their
respective agreements as a condition to granting a waiver or consent under their agreement. The pursuit of
such rights by the counterparties may result in the Combined Company suffering a loss of potential future
revenue or incurring liabilities and may result in the loss of rights that are material to the Combined
Company’s business. There can be no assurances that such counterparties will not exercise their rights
under these agreements, including termination rights where available, or that the exercise of any such rights
under, or modification of, these agreements will not adversely affect the business or operations of the
Combined Company.
Risks Related to an Investment in the Combined Company Common Stock Following the Mergers
The market price and trading volume of the Combined Company common stock may be volatile.
The Combined Company’s common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations, and
investors in shares of the Combined Company common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their
shares, including decreases unrelated to the Combined Company’s operating performance or prospects.
Prologis and Duke Realty cannot assure you that the market price of the Combined Company common stock
will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.
In addition to the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section, a number of factors could negatively affect the
Combined Company’s share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the Combined
Company common stock, including:
the annual yield from distributions on the Combined Company common stock as compared to yields
on other financial instruments;
equity issuances by the Combined Company, or future sales of substantial amounts of the Combined
Company common stock by its existing or future stockholders, or the perception that such issuances
or future sales may occur;

limiting the Combined Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital,
capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; and
limiting the Combined Company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business
and its industry.
If the Combined Company defaults under a mortgage loan, it will automatically be in default under any other
loan that has cross-default provisions, and it may lose the properties securing these loans. Although the
Combined Company anticipates that it will pay off its mortgage payables as soon as prepayment penalties
and other costs make it economically feasible to do so, the Combined Company cannot anticipate when such
payment will occur.
The future results of the Combined Company will suffer if the Combined Company does not effectively manage its
expanded operations following the mergers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The market price of shares of the common stock of the Combined Company may be affected by factors different from
those affecting the prices of shares of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock before the mergers.
The results of operations of the Combined Company, as well as the market price of the common stock of the
Combined Company, after the mergers may be affected by other factors in addition to those currently
affecting Prologis’ or Duke Realty’s results of operations and the market prices of Prologis common stock
and Duke Realty common stock. These factors include:
a greater number of shares of the Combined Company common stock outstanding as compared to the
number of currently outstanding shares of Prologis common stock;
different stockholders; and
different assets and capitalizations.
Accordingly, the historical market prices and financial results of Prologis and Duke Realty may not be
indicative for the Combined Company after the mergers. For a discussion of the businesses of Prologis and
Duke Realty and certain risks to consider in connection with investing in those businesses, see the
documents incorporated by reference by Prologis and Duke Realty into this joint proxy statement/​
prospectus referred to under “Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference”
beginning on page 174.
The market price of the Combined Company common stock may decline as a result of the mergers.
The market price of the Combined Company common stock may decline as a result of the mergers if the
Combined Company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the mergers as rapidly or to the extent
anticipated by financial or industry analysts, or the effect of the mergers on the Combined Company’s
financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.
In addition, upon consummation of the mergers, Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders will
own interests in a Combined Company operating an expanded business with a different mix of properties,
risks and liabilities. Current Prologis stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders may not wish to continue to
invest in the Combined Company, or for other reasons may wish to dispose of some or all of their shares of
the Combined Company common stock. If, following the company merger effective time, large amounts of the
Combined Company common stock are sold, the price of the Combined Company common stock could
decline.
After the mergers are completed, Duke Realty shareholders that receive shares of Prologis common stock in the
company merger will have different rights that may be less favorable than their current rights as Duke Realty
shareholders.
After the closing of the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders that receive shares of Prologis common stock in
the company merger will have different rights than they currently have as Duke Realty shareholders. For a
detailed discussion of the similarities and material differences between the current rights you have as a Duke
Realty shareholder and the rights you will have as a stockholder of the Combined Company following the
mergers, see “Comparison of Rights of the Prologis Stockholders and the Duke Realty Shareholders”
beginning on page 154.
The Combined Company cannot assure you that it will be able to continue paying dividends at or above the rates
currently paid by Prologis and Duke Realty.
The stockholders of the Combined Company may not receive dividends at the same rate they received
dividends as Prologis stockholders and as Duke Realty shareholders following the mergers for various
reasons, including the following:
the Combined Company may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in the
Combined Company’s cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position;
36 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all
times entirely at the discretion of the Combined Company’s board of directors, which reserves the
right to change Prologis’ current dividend practices at any time and for any reason;
the Combined Company may desire to retain cash to maintain or improve its credit ratings; and
the amount of dividends that the Combined Company’s subsidiaries may distribute to the Combined
Company may be subject to restrictions imposed by state law and restrictions imposed by the terms
of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.
Stockholders of the Combined Company will have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have
not been declared by the Combined Company’s board of directors.
The Combined Company may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future.
In connection with executing the Combined Company’s business strategies following the mergers, the
Combined Company expects to evaluate the possibility of additional acquisitions and strategic investments,
and the Combined Company may elect to finance these endeavors by incurring additional indebtedness. The
amount of such indebtedness could have material adverse consequences for the Combined Company,
including hindering the Combined Company’s ability to adjust to changing market, industry or economic
conditions; limiting the Combined Company’s ability to access the capital markets to refinance maturing debt
or to fund acquisitions or emerging businesses; limiting the amount of free cash flow available for future
operations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases or other uses; making the Combined Company more
vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases; and placing the Combined
Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors.
The historical and unaudited pro forma combined financial information included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus may not be representative of the Combined Company’s results following the mergers, and
accordingly, you have limited financial information on which to evaluate the Combined Company.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative
of the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the mergers been
completed as of the date indicated, nor is it indicative of the future operating results or financial position of
the Combined Company. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect future
events that may occur after the company merger effective time, including the costs related to the planned
integration of the two companies and any future nonrecurring charges resulting from the mergers, and does
not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expense efficiencies. The
unaudited pro forma combined financial information presented elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/​prospectus is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the mergers that Prologis and Duke
Realty believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Prologis and Duke Realty cannot assure you that the
assumptions will prove to be accurate over time.
The Combined Company may incur adverse tax consequences if Prologis or Duke Realty has failed or fails to
qualify as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes.
Each of Prologis and Duke Realty has operated in a manner that it believes has allowed it to qualify as a REIT
for United States federal income tax purposes under the Code and each intends to continue to do so through
the closing date or the moment in time immediately prior to the company merger effective time, respectively.
The Combined Company intends to continue operating in such a manner following the mergers. The closing
of the mergers is conditioned on the receipt by Prologis of an opinion of Duke Realty’s counsel to the effect
that Duke Realty has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and on the receipt by Duke Realty of an opinion of Prologis’ counsel
to the effect that Prologis has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and Prologis’ proposed method of organization and
operation will enable it to continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under
the Code. The foregoing REIT opinions, however, are limited to the factual representations provided by
Prologis and Duke Realty to counsel and the assumptions set forth therein, and
37 
• 
• 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
are not a guarantee that Prologis or Duke Realty, in fact, has qualified or that the Combined Company will
continue to qualify as a REIT. Moreover, neither Duke Realty nor Prologis has requested or plans to request
a ruling from the IRS that it qualifies as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly
technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations is greater
in the case of a REIT, like Prologis, that holds assets through a partnership and that has substantial foreign
operations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within Duke Realty’s
and Prologis’ control may affect their ability to qualify as REITs.
If Prologis or Duke Realty (or, following the mergers, the Combined Company) loses its REIT status, or is
determined to have lost its REIT status in a prior year, it will face serious tax consequences that would
substantially reduce its cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to its
stockholders or shareholders, respectively, because:
it would be subject to United States federal income tax on its net income at regular corporate rates for
the years it did not qualify for taxation as a REIT (and, for such years, would not be allowed a
deduction for dividends paid to stockholders or shareholders, respectively, in computing its taxable
income);
it could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes
for such periods;
unless it is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, neither it nor any “successor”
company could elect to be taxed as a REIT until the fifth taxable year following the year during which
it was disqualified; and
for five years following re-election of REIT status, upon a taxable disposition of an asset owned as of
such re-election, it could be subject to corporate level tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in
such asset at the time of re-election.
As a result of all these factors, Prologis’ or Duke Realty’s (or following the mergers, the Combined
Company’s) failure to qualify as a REIT could impair the Combined Company’s ability to expand its business
and raise capital, and would materially adversely affect the value of its capital stock.
In certain circumstances, even if the Combined Company qualifies as a REIT, it and its subsidiaries may be subject
to certain United States federal, state, and other taxes, which would reduce the Combined Company’s cash available
for distribution to its stockholders.
Even if the Combined Company has qualified and continues to qualify as a REIT, it may be subject to some
federal, state and local taxes on its income or property and, in certain cases, a 100% penalty tax, in the event
it sells property as a dealer. In addition, the Combined Company’s domestic corporate subsidiaries that are
taxable REIT subsidiaries could be subject to federal and state taxes, and its foreign properties and
companies are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they operate and are located. Any federal, state or
other taxes the Combined Company pays will reduce its cash available for distribution to stockholders.
If Prologis OP is classified as a “publicly traded partnership” under the Code, the Combined Company’s status as a
REIT and its ability to pay distributions to the Combined Company’s stockholders could be adversely affected.
Prologis OP is organized as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Even though
Prologis OP will not elect to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation, it may be taxed as a
corporation if it is deemed to be a “publicly traded partnership.” A publicly traded partnership is a
partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are considered readily tradable
on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Prologis believes and currently takes the
position that Prologis OP should not be classified as a publicly traded partnership because interests in
Prologis OP are not traded on an established securities market or the substantial equivalent thereof, and
Prologis OP should satisfy certain safe harbors, which prevent a partnership’s interests from being treated as
readily tradable on an established securities market or substantial equivalent thereof. No assurance can be
given, however, that the IRS would not assert that Prologis OP constitutes a publicly traded partnership or
that facts
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and circumstances will not develop which could result in Prologis OP being treated as a publicly traded
partnership. If the IRS were to assert successfully that Prologis OP is a publicly traded partnership, and
substantially all of Prologis OP’s gross income did not consist of specified types of passive income, Prologis
OP would be treated as an association taxable as a corporation and would be subject to corporate tax at the
entity level. In such event, the character of the Combined Company’s assets and items of gross income
would change and would result in a termination of the Combined Company’s status as a REIT. In addition,
the imposition of a corporate tax on Prologis OP would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution
to the Combined Company’s stockholders.
The Combined Company depends on key personnel for its future success, and the loss of key personnel or inability to
attract and retain personnel could harm the Combined Company’s business.
The members of the Prologis board, together with James B. Connor, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of Duke Realty, and Prologis’ executive officers will continue as the members of the board and executive
management of the Combined Company. The future success of the Combined Company depends in large part
on its ability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. The future success of the
Combined Company also depends upon the service of the Combined Company’s executive officers, who
have extensive market knowledge and relationships and will exercise substantial influence over the
Combined Company’s operational, financing, acquisition and disposition activity. Among the reasons that
they are important to the Combined Company’s success is that each has a national or regional industry
reputation that is expected to attract business and investment opportunities and assist the Combined
Company in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants and industry personnel.
Many of the Combined Company’s other key executive personnel, particularly its senior managers, also have
extensive experience and strong reputations in the industry. In particular, the extent and nature of the
relationships that these individuals have developed with financial institutions and existing and prospective
customers is critically important to the success of the Combined Company’s business. The loss of services
of one or more members of the Combined Company’s senior management team, or the Combined Company’s
inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect the Combined Company’s
business, diminish the Combined Company’s investment opportunities and weaken its relationships with
lenders, business partners, existing and prospective customers and industry personnel, which could
materially and adversely affect the Combined Company.
Prologis and Duke Realty face other risks.
The foregoing risks are not exhaustive, and you should be aware that, following the mergers, the Combined
Company will face various other risks, including those discussed in reports filed by Prologis and Duke
Realty with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference”
beginning on page 174.

Prologis was formed in 1997 and is a global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high growth
markets. Prologis owns, manages and develops well-located, high-quality logistics facilities in 19 countries
across four continents. Prologis’ teams actively manage its portfolio to provide comprehensive real estate
services, including leasing, property management, development, acquisitions and dispositions. Prologis
invests significant capital each year into new logistics properties principally through our development
activity and third-party acquisitions. Prologis’ property dispositions allow Prologis to recycle capital and
contribute to self-funding these development and acquisition activities. The majority of Prologis’ properties
in the U.S. are wholly owned, while its properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment
ventures to mitigate Prologis’ exposure to foreign currency movements.
Prologis commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997, elected to be taxed as a
REIT under the Code, and believes the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis to
maintain its status as a REIT.
Prologis OP was formed in 1997 and is the primary operating subsidiary of Prologis. As of March 31, 2022,
Prologis owned an approximate 97.25% common general partnership interest in Prologis OP and substantially
all of the preferred units in Prologis OP. As the sole general partner of Prologis OP, Prologis has complete
responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of Prologis OP. Prologis only holds a
de minimis amount of assets outside of Prologis OP.
Prologis common stock is listed on the NYSE, trading under the symbol “PLD.” Prologis’ global headquarters
are located at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111; its telephone number is (415) 394-9000. Prologis’

do not indicate how their shares of Duke Realty common stock should be voted on a proposal, the shares of Duke
Realty common stock represented by their properly executed proxy will be voted as the Duke Realty board
recommends and therefore, FOR the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal, FOR the Duke Realty compensation
proposal and FOR the Duke Realty adjournment proposal. If your shares of Duke Realty common stock are held
in “street name” by your broker or other nominee and you do not provide voting instructions to your broker
or other nominee, your broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote those shares and it will have the
effect as described above under “- Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes.”
Shares of Duke Realty common stock held in the Duke Realty 401(k) plan are voted by the Duke Realty 401(k)

such shares of the Duke Realty common stock have been allocated. Participants in the Duke Realty 401(k)
plan may not vote their plan shares at the Duke Realty special meeting and in order to vote their shares, must
provide voting instructions to the trustee by September 22, 2022 at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time. Any shares of
Duke Realty common stock held in the Duke Realty 401(k) plan for which no instructions are received will not
be voted.

(Proposal 1 on the Duke Realty Proxy Card)
The Duke Realty shareholders are being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the merger
agreement (including the plan of merger set forth therein) and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the company merger. For a summary and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the
information about the mergers and the merger agreement throughout this joint proxy statement/​prospectus,
including the information set forth in the sections entitled “The Mergers” and “The Merger Agreement”. A
copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/​prospectus.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, approval of this proposal is a condition to the consummation of the
mergers. If this proposal is not approved, the mergers will not be completed.
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Duke Realty common stock entitled to vote on such proposal.

agreement proposal.",65,65

(Proposal 2 on the Duke Realty Proxy Card)
The Duke Realty shareholders are being asked to consider and vote on a non-binding advisory proposal to
approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Duke Realty named executive officers.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Section 14A of the
Exchange Act, Duke Realty is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory
vote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Duke Realty’s named executive officers, as
determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, that is based upon or otherwise relates to the
mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and arises from any form of
arrangement or understanding, whether written or unwritten, between Duke Realty or the Combined
Company and the named executive officers of Duke Realty. Duke Realty therefore is asking its shareholders
to vote on the adoption of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Duke Realty Corporation’s
named executive officers in connection with the mergers and the agreements or understandings
pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Mergers - Interests of Duke Realty’s Directors and
Named Executive Officers in the Mergers” is hereby APPROVED.”
Vote Required
The vote regarding the Duke Realty compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
Duke Realty merger agreement proposal. Because the vote regarding merger-related compensation is
advisory only, it will not be binding on either Duke Realty or Prologis regardless of whether the mergers are
completed. Accordingly, if the mergers are completed, the merger-related compensation will become payable
in connection with the mergers and a qualifying termination of employment, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this non-binding advisory vote.
Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the Duke Realty compensation proposal requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of all votes cast on such proposal.

(Proposal 3 on the Duke Realty Proxy Card)
The Duke Realty shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give the chairman of the Duke
Realty special meeting the authority to adjourn the Duke Realty special meeting one or more times to another
date, time or place, to permit, among other things, further solicitation of proxies, if necessary or appropriate,
to obtain additional votes in favor of the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal if there are not sufficient
votes at the time of the Duke Realty special meeting to approve such proposal.
If, at the Duke Realty special meeting, the number of shares of Duke Realty common stock present in person
or represented by proxy and voting for the approval of the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal is
insufficient to approve such proposal, Duke Realty intends to adjourn the Duke Realty special meeting to
another place, date or time in order to enable the Duke Realty board to solicit additional proxies for approval
of the proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all
votes cast on such proposal. In addition, under Duke Realty’s bylaws, if a quorum is not present at the Duke
Realty special meeting, the chairman of the Duke Realty special meeting, or the holders of a majority of the
shares entitled to vote that are present in person or by proxy at the Duke Realty special meeting, may
adjourn the Duke Realty special meeting to another place, date, or time.

The boards of directors and management teams of Prologis and Duke Realty periodically and in the ordinary
course evaluate and consider a variety of financial and strategic opportunities as part of their respective
long-term strategies to enhance value for their respective shareholders, including potential acquisitions,
divestitures, business combinations and other transactions. Members of the management teams of each of
Prologis and Duke Realty from time to time have met or otherwise communicated informally and
independently with each other and with representatives of other real estate companies and investors
regarding industry trends and considerations and the performance, business, strategic direction and
prospects of their respective companies.
On July 15, 2020, Hamid R. Moghadam, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Prologis, contacted a
representative of Morgan Stanley, which was generally known to have an investment banking relationship
with Duke Realty, to discuss Prologis’ interest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction between the
companies. The representative of Morgan Stanley contacted James B. Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Duke Realty, to inform him of Prologis’ interest in a potential strategic transaction between
Prologis and Duke Realty. Thereafter, Mr. Connor reported to David P. Stockert, Lead Independent Director
of Duke Realty, regarding the call between the representative of Morgan Stanley and Mr. Moghadam. Mr.
Connor and Mr. Stockert agreed that, while there were potential merits to a transaction with Prologis,
Prologis would need to make a compelling offer for Duke Realty to consider engaging in negotiations
regarding a potential strategic transaction and sharing non-public information. At such time, Duke Realty
and Prologis did not engage in further substantive discussions regarding a potential transaction,
56 TABLE OF CONTENTS
enter into a non-disclosure agreement or exchange non-public information. Mr. Connor and Mr. Moghadam
and other members of the Prologis and Duke Realty executive management teams continued to have
occasional, informal communications with each other, including at industry events and elsewhere, but no
specific terms of a potential transaction between the parties were discussed during these informal
communications.
On January 27, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley presented to the Duke Realty board a review of the
strategic landscape, an assessment of Duke Realty’s business plan and prospects and, among other topics,
observations regarding a potential merger or sale to third parties, including Prologis.
On or about April 30, 2021, a representative from Goldman Sachs, on behalf of Prologis, contacted a
representative from Morgan Stanley to inquire about a potential strategic transaction between Prologis and
Duke Realty and indicated a mid-teens premium. The representative of Morgan Stanley, upon consultation
with Mr. Connor, informed the Goldman Sachs representative that Duke Realty was open to an approach from
Prologis but it would need to be at a materially higher premium given the prospects for Duke Realty. There
was no follow up from this discussion.
On August 3, 2021, Eugene F. Reilly, Chief Investment Officer of Prologis, contacted Mr. Connor regarding
Prologis’ interest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction between the companies.
On August 17, 2021, Mr. Reilly contacted Mr. Connor and suggested an in person meeting to discuss
Prologis’ interest in a potential strategic transaction. Mr. Connor indicated that a premium in the 20% or
greater range would be appropriate, while Mr. Reilly believed a premium around 15% was more reflective of
market premia paid in similar transactions. Mr. Reilly and Mr. Connor subsequently confirmed to each other
that members of the management teams of Prologis and Duke Realty, including Mr. Reilly and Mr. Connor,
would be available to meet on August 30, 2021.
On August 30, 2021, Mr. Reilly, Thomas S. Olinger, then Chief Financial Officer of Prologis, and Timothy D.
Arndt, then Treasurer of Prologis, met with Mr. Connor and Mark A. Denien, Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of Duke Realty, to discuss Prologis’ interest in a potential strategic transaction.
During the discussion, Mr. Olinger and Mr. Arndt discussed preliminary valuations of Prologis and Duke
Realty and indicated that Prologis would be interested in a stock-for-stock transaction with Duke Realty that
valued Duke Realty at a 15% premium to the closing price of Duke Realty common stock of $50.59 on August
27, 2021, which at that time would have equated to an implied exchange ratio of approximately 0.445 of a
share of Prologis common stock for each share of Duke Realty common stock. Mr. Connor indicated that he
did not believe such offer sufficiently valued Duke Realty.
On September 7, 2021, Mr. Connor updated Mr. Stockert on the August 30th meeting with members of the
Prologis executive management team, including Prologis’ proposed valuation of Duke Realty. Mr. Connor and
Mr. Stockert agreed that the proposed offer and the premium and exchange ratio implied thereby was
insufficient and decided to not engage further with Prologis on a potential transaction at that time.
On September 21, 2021, the Prologis board held a regularly scheduled meeting. At this meeting, Mr.
Moghadam provided an update to the Prologis board with respect to discussions with Duke Realty regarding
a potential strategic transaction between the two companies. The Prologis board was supportive of Prologis
management continuing to seek further discussions with Duke Realty.
On October 26-27, 2021, the Duke Realty board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Mr. Connor informed the
Duke Realty board of Prologis’ interest in a potential strategic transaction between the two companies. Mr.
Connor summarized the discussions to date with Prologis and noted that Prologis had proposed a stock-for-
stock transaction that valued Duke Realty at a 15% premium over the then-current market price of Duke
Realty common stock, which he believed did not sufficiently value Duke Realty. Following discussion, the
Duke Realty board agreed that such a valuation was insufficient and did not warrant further discussions with
Prologis at that time.
On October 29, 2021, Mr. Connor and Mr. Moghadam met informally while attending an industry conference
in Napa, California. Mr. Connor and Mr. Moghadam discussed the industry in general and their respective
companies, but no specific terms of a potential transaction between the two companies were discussed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 4, 2021, Mr. Reilly contacted Mr. Connor to request certain financial information regarding
Duke Realty that would be helpful to Prologis in continuing to analyze a potential strategic transaction
between the two companies. Mr. Reilly and Mr. Connor agreed to schedule another discussion between the
respective executive management teams.
On November 15, 2021, members of the Prologis executive management team, including Mr. Reilly, and
members of the Duke Realty executive management team, including Mr. Connor, communicated regarding
Prologis’ request for certain non-public financial information in advance of their upcoming meeting to assist
Prologis in evaluating a potential strategic transaction. During this exchange, Mr. Connor communicated
that, while Duke Realty was willing to engage in high-level discussions about a potential strategic
transaction, no decision had been made to engage in a strategic transaction with Prologis and therefore it
was not prepared to provide non-public information at that time absent a compelling proposal from Prologis.
On November 17, 2021, members of the Prologis executive management team and members of the Duke Realty
executive management team held a meeting and discussed various financial and performance metrics at a
high level, including earnings growth, rent growth and mark to market for the sector. No non-public
information was discussed at that time nor were specific terms of a potential strategic transaction discussed.
On November 23, 2021, Mr. Reilly contacted Mr. Connor and indicated that Prologis intended to provide
Duke Realty with a proposal for a potential strategic transaction in the coming days.
On November 29, 2021, Prologis sent Duke Realty a written preliminary non-binding proposal for an all-stock
transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.465 of a share of Prologis common stock for each share of Duke Realty
common stock, which would result in an implied premium of 20% to the closing price of Duke Realty common
stock of $59.13 on November 23, 2021, which we refer to as the “November 29 Proposal.” The November 29
Proposal requested an exclusivity period of 30 days to conduct diligence and negotiate mutually acceptable
documentation. Later that day, Mr. Connor updated Mr. Stockert as to the receipt of the November 29
Proposal and they agreed to schedule a meeting of the Duke Realty board to review and consider the
November 29 Proposal.
On November 30, 2021, the Duke Realty board held a meeting to review and discuss the November 29
Proposal. Mr. Connor provided a summary of the preliminary discussions between Duke Realty and Prologis
and of the November 29 Proposal. Mr. Denien reviewed with the Duke Realty board an updated version of
the materials prepared by Morgan Stanley that were previously discussed with the Duke Realty board at the
January 2021 meeting regarding the strategic landscape, an assessment of Duke Realty’s business plan and
prospects and, among other topics, observations regarding a potential merger or sale to third parties,
including Prologis. The Duke Realty board discussed the merits of and risks related to the November 29
Proposal and to continuing to pursue Duke Realty’s existing business strategy as an independent, stand-
alone company, noting, among other things, that while the November 29 Proposal was at a significant
premium to historical and recent trading prices of Duke Realty common stock, Duke Realty management
believed that Duke Realty had the potential to achieve significant growth in funds from operations, which we
refer to as “FFO,” and total shareholder returns. The Duke Realty board discussed various possible
responses to Prologis, including whether to propose a counteroffer to the exchange ratio proposed in the
November 29 Proposal, but determined that the November 29 Proposal did not present a sufficiently
compelling exchange ratio (including premium implied thereby) to warrant further engaging with Prologis.
Following this discussion, the Duke Realty board instructed management to send a written response to
Prologis rejecting the November 29 Proposal and indicating that Duke Realty was not prepared to engage
further at that time unless Prologis submitted a more compelling proposal.
On December 1, 2021, Duke Realty sent a letter to Prologis indicating that the Duke Realty board did not find
the November 29 Proposal to present a compelling premium and therefore Duke Realty was not prepared to
engage in further negotiations at that time. The letter further indicated that Duke Realty was optimistic about
its future outlook, given favorable metrics such as the significant opportunity for rent increases upon lease
expirations (with management forecasting a 30% mark-to-market increase on rents in its portfolio), 14%
projected FFO growth in 2021 and a $1.1 billion development pipeline, and the significant benefits to Prologis
of a transaction, including substantial cash synergies and the addition of a high-quality
58 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
portfolio, warranted a premium in the high 20% or low 30% range to the closing price of Duke Realty common
stock of $58.33 on November 30, 2021.
On December 15, 2021, Mr. Moghadam contacted a representative of Morgan Stanley to discuss the
November 29 Proposal and the response received from Duke Realty on December 1. Mr. Moghadam stated
that the premium represented by the November 29 Proposal was now higher given the recent performance of
the Prologis stock.
On December 16, 2021, Mr. Connor received an update from a representative of Morgan Stanley regarding the
December 15th discussion with Mr. Moghadam. Later that day, Mr. Connor contacted Mr. Reilly regarding
the November 29 Proposal and Duke Realty’s response. Mr. Connor reiterated several points included in the
December 1 letter, including that Duke Realty’s 2021 projected FFO growth, development pipeline and
potential cash synergies warranted a higher valuation.
On December 20, 2021, Mr. Reilly contacted Mr. Connor in response to Duke Realty’s December 1st letter and
provided additional information regarding recent market comparisons for merger transactions.
On December 22, 2021, Mr. Reilly and Mr. Olinger contacted Mr. Connor and expressed Prologis’ continuing
interest in a strategic transaction with Duke Realty, and presented updated valuation information regarding
the November 29 Proposal. During this discussion, Mr. Reilly and Mr. Olinger indicated that Prologis would
not be able to offer an exchange ratio representing a 30% premium to the price of Duke Realty common stock
at that time. Following this discussion, there were no further communications between representatives of
Prologis and representatives of Duke Realty about a potential strategic transaction between the two
companies until March 2022 as described below.
On January 26, 2022, the Duke Realty board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Mr. Connor updated the
Duke Realty board on the discussions with Prologis since December 2021, including that he did not expect
further communications with Prologis following the December 22, 2021 discussion unless Prologis was
prepared to present a more compelling exchange ratio and premium.
On March 6, 2022, Mr. Connor and Mr. Moghadam met informally while attending an industry conference in
Florida during which they discussed the November 29 Proposal. Mr. Moghadam presented to Mr. Connor
certain analyses showing that while Duke Realty was outperforming the industry as a whole, Prologis had
been outperforming Duke Realty and the proposed exchange ratio of 0.465 of a share of Prologis common
stock for each share of Duke Realty common stock included in the November 29 Proposal was now even
more favorable to Duke Realty shareholders than it had been in November 2021, with an implied premium in
the high 20% range. Mr. Moghadam also indicated that Prologis would consider adding one existing Duke
Realty board member to the Combined Company’s board of directors. During this discussion, Mr. Moghadam
noted that the November 29 Proposal was still on the table but would not remain open indefinitely, and
requested that the Duke Realty board reconsider the November 29 Proposal. Mr. Connor indicated that he
would discuss the continued availability of the November 29 Proposal with Mr. Stockert, but noted that since
November 2021, Duke Realty’s operating performance had only further improved.
Also on March 6, 2022, Mr. Connor updated Mr. Stockert and representatives of Morgan Stanley on his
discussion with Mr. Moghadam. Based on the discussions at the prior Duke Realty board meeting on
November 30, 2021 regarding the November 29 Proposal, and the fact that no change had been made to
Prologis’ proposed exchange ratio in the November 29 Proposal, Messrs. Connor and Stockert, in
consultation with representatives of Morgan Stanley, concluded that Prologis’ proposal remained unchanged
and insufficient to warrant further engagement with Prologis. Absent further developments, Messrs. Connor
and Stockert agreed that this matter would be taken up at the Duke Realty board’s next regularly scheduled
meeting, scheduled to take place in April 2022.
On March 25, 2022, following the discussions between Mr. Connor and Mr. Moghadam on March 6, 2022, Mr.
Connor contacted Mr. Moghadam to inform him that Prologis would need to present a more compelling offer
in order for Duke Realty to consider further engaging with Prologis regarding a potential strategic
transaction between the two companies. Mr. Moghadam discussed the benefits of a potential strategic
59 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
transaction while Mr. Connor reiterated that given such benefits, the proposed offer should reflect an
improved exchange ratio and that Duke Realty was not prepared to engage with Prologis unless the exchange
ratio was improved.
On March 31, 2022, Mr. Moghadam contacted Mr. Connor and reiterated Prologis’ belief that the November
29 Proposal was a strong offer and represented an increasing implied premium to Duke Realty common stock
based on recent trading prices. Mr. Moghadam also shared with Mr. Connor certain information regarding
the benefits that former shareholders of DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and Liberty Property Trust have received
as a result of receiving Prologis common stock in Prologis’ respective acquisitions of such companies.
Following this discussion, there were no further communications between Prologis and Duke Realty or their
respective representatives regarding a potential strategic transaction between the two companies until April
29, 2022 as described below.
On April 19, 2022 and on several occasions thereafter, at the request of Duke Realty, a representative from
Morgan Stanley discussed with a representative of a large private equity firm with a significant real estate
business, which we refer to as “Party A,” which had previously expressed interest in a potential strategic
transaction involving Duke Realty, whether Party A still had interest in Duke Realty. Party A conveyed
knowledge of and liking for Duke Realty and its assets and expressed conceptual interest in a transaction.
Party A stated that they planned to undertake a further internal evaluation of Duke Realty and would follow
up with Morgan Stanley. From this date through May 11, 2022, Party A declined to provide a proposal
despite further inquiry from Morgan Stanley.
On April 22, 2022, the Duke Realty board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Mr. Connor provided an update
on the various discussions on and prior to March 31, 2022 with Prologis, including Prologis’ request that the
Duke Realty board reconsider the November 29 Proposal, and noted, among other things, that Prologis had
not increased the exchange ratio included in the November 29 Proposal. The Duke Realty board discussed
that a hypothetical exchange ratio of 0.475-0.480 of a share of Prologis common stock for each share of Duke
Realty common stock (which at that time would result in an implied premium of approximately 34% to recent
closing prices of Duke Realty common stock), would be worth considering on the basis that such exchange
ratio would still be expected to be accretive to Prologis both on an FFO and adjusted funds from operations,
which we refer to as “AFFO,” basis and such exchange ratio would represent a compelling outcome for Duke
Realty’s shareholders. Following discussion, the Duke Realty board reiterated its prior determination not to
negotiate with Prologis unless a more compelling proposal was presented, but instructed Mr. Connor to
indicate to Prologis that should Prologis increase its offer, the Duke Realty board would consider authorizing
further discussions and due diligence.
On April 29, 2022, after consultation with a representative of Morgan Stanley, Mr. Connor contacted Mr.
Moghadam to reiterate that the Duke Realty board had again reviewed the November 29 Proposal, that the
Duke Realty board was not interested in a potential strategic transaction at the proposed exchange ratio, but
that Prologis was welcome to propose an improved exchange ratio. Mr. Connor also reiterated Duke Realty’s
rationale for its determination that the proposed exchange ratio was insufficient and why Prologis should be
able to offer a more attractive exchange ratio. Mr. Connor further noted that while Duke Realty was not
engaged in a sale process, Duke Realty shareholders could benefit under an appropriate exchange ratio
framework and the Duke Realty board was prepared to review a more compelling proposal in a timely manner.
In response, during this discussion, Mr. Moghadam indicated that Prologis was prepared to increase the
proposed exchange ratio from 0.465 to 0.466 of a share of Prologis common stock for each share of Duke
Realty common stock (which represented an implied value of $80.62 per share of Duke Realty common stock
based on the closing price of Prologis common stock on April 28, 2022, and a 34% premium for Duke Realty
shareholders over the closing price of Duke Realty common stock on such date), which we refer to as the
“Revised Proposal.”
On May 2, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted Mr. Stockert and a representative of Morgan Stanley to update them
on his April 29 discussion with Mr. Moghadam. They agreed that, based on prior board discussions, the
proposed exchange ratio increase to 0.466 was not likely to be viewed by the Duke Realty board as a
sufficient increase and that Duke Realty should continue its current approach and not engage in further
negotiations with Prologis regarding a strategic transaction unless Prologis further improved its proposed
exchange ratio. That same day, Mr. Moghadam contacted Mr. Connor to request an update from Duke Realty
prior to an upcoming Prologis board meeting.
60 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On May 3, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted Mr. Moghadam during which Mr. Connor reiterated Duke Realty’s
position regarding the Revised Proposal. Mr. Connor and Mr. Moghadam also discussed the impact of recent
stock price declines in the industry. During this discussion, Mr. Connor noted that for purposes of analyzing
the potential benefits of a strategic transaction, the focus should be on 2023 and 2024 FFO and AFFO
growth, rather than 2022 figures, and reiterated that the Duke Realty board would consider a further revised
proposal with a higher exchange ratio.
Later on May 3, 2022, Mr. Connor updated Mr. Stockert and another member of the Duke Realty board, and a
representative of Morgan Stanley, on his discussion with Mr. Moghadam. The representative of Morgan
Stanley and Mr. Connor also discussed the merits of and considerations involved in potentially introducing
a floating exchange ratio and a cash election into the discussion with Prologis as a means to elicit an
improved offer from Prologis. It was ultimately concluded to continue to wait for Prologis to further increase
its offer above the Revised Proposal before engaging further.
Also on May 3, 2022, Mr. Moghadam sent Mr. Connor a letter following up on their earlier conversation and
reiterating the specifics of the Revised Proposal. Mr. Moghadam noted, among other things, that the
November 29 Proposal then represented a premium of nearly 34% to Duke Realty shareholders based on
trading prices as of such date, and the Revised Proposal was a symbolic, good faith gesture to show
movement, but would expire on May 6, 2022. In response, on May 3, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted Mr.
Moghadam to clarify that Duke Realty may be interested in a potential strategic transaction and reiterated
how Duke Realty would contribute to the merits of a combined company, but noted that the Revised
Proposal was not at a level that Duke Realty would accept. Mr. Connor also noted that Duke Realty believed
that Prologis can afford and should pay more for Duke Realty, and reiterated that he was encouraging Mr.
Moghadam to improve the offer and that the Duke Realty board was open to and would consider a more
compelling offer. Mr. Moghadam responded that the friendly and private negotiations between the two
parties did not seem to be resulting in any progress, despite both parties acknowledging that a transaction
could be compelling to the companies and their shareholders.
On May 4, 2022, the Prologis board held a meeting, during which, among other things, Mr. Moghadam
provided an update to the Prologis board with respect to discussions with Duke Realty regarding a potential
strategic transaction between the two companies, including the recent correspondence between Mr.
Moghadam and Mr. Connor.
Also on May 4, 2022, Mr. Moghadam contacted Mr. Connor to reiterate that Prologis had improved its offer
from 0.465 to 0.466 as a gesture of goodwill and that Prologis continued to believe that the Revised Proposal
was a compelling offer and that Prologis was not inclined to increase it further at such time.
On May 9, 2022, the Prologis board held a meeting to discuss the potential strategic transaction between
Prologis and Duke Realty. Members of Prologis management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which we refer to as “Wachtell Lipton,” Prologis’ legal counsel, were also
present. Mr. Moghadam provided an update to the Prologis board regarding the recent discussions with
Duke Realty. Mr. Moghadam stated that, in light of the compelling premium represented by the Revised
Proposal, the continued belief of Prologis management and Prologis’ financial advisor in the strategic
rationale for the transaction and Duke Realty’s continued decision not to engage with Prologis, it would be
prudent to publicly release an offer letter to Duke Realty and issue a press release regarding the offer. After
discussion, the Prologis board approved Prologis taking such action.
On May 10, 2022, Prologis sent a letter to Duke Realty reiterating its proposal to acquire Duke Realty at an
exchange ratio of 0.466 of a share of Prologis common stock for each share of Duke Realty common stock.
The letter also summarized Prologis’ rationale for the strategic transaction and provided a brief history of the
discussions between representatives of Prologis and Duke Realty since November 2021. Shortly thereafter,
Prologis issued a press release disclosing its interest in a potential strategic transaction with Duke Realty
and the May 10 letter sent to Duke Realty.
Later on May 10, 2022, the Duke Realty board met to discuss Prologis’ latest letter and subsequent press
release, and Duke Realty’s potential response. The Duke Realty board also discussed the change in
dynamics from a private negotiation to a public campaign. In light of the public nature of the unsolicited
offer, the Duke Realty board determined to formally engage outside legal and financial advisors at that time,
61 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and engaged Hogan Lovells US LLP, which we refer to as “Hogan Lovells,” which had represented Duke
Realty on prior significant transactions, as its outside legal counsel and Morgan Stanley, which had
provided various financial advisory and financing services to Duke Realty in the past and in the discussions
with Prologis, as its outside financial advisor.
On May 11, 2022, Duke Realty issued a press release in response to the Prologis May 10th press release,
which, among other things, reiterated that while Duke Realty was open to exploring all paths to maximize
shareholder value, the Revised Proposal that Prologis made public on May 10 was insufficient in that regard.
Also on May 11, 2022, a representative of Party A contacted a representative of Morgan Stanley regarding
Party A’s potential interest in a transaction involving Duke Realty. The parties discussed Party A’s potential
interest in different forms of strategic transactions. Subsequent to this discussion, the representative of
Party A indicated to the representative of Morgan Stanley that Party A was not interested in pursuing a
transaction with Duke Realty.
On May 12, 2022, the Duke Realty board met with members of the executive management team of Duke Realty
and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Hogan Lovells participating. At the meeting, representatives of
Hogan Lovells discussed with the Duke Realty board the duties of a director under Indiana law in
connection with the consideration of unsolicited offers and sale transactions. Representatives of Morgan
Stanley discussed with the Duke Realty board, among other topics, a comparison of Duke Realty’s and
Prologis’s relative share price performance and public market valuation levels, a comparison of Duke Realty’s
and Prologis’s forecasted operating and financial performance, and a preliminary financial analysis of a
potential combination with Prologis. Representatives of Morgan Stanley also apprised the Duke Realty board
of its conversations with Party A.
Throughout May 2022 until the beginning of June 2022, Mr. Moghadam and other members of Prologis
senior management held discussions with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Global Markets,
Inc., which we refer to as “Citi,” who was also acting as a financial advisor to Prologis, and with
representatives of Wachtell Lipton, regarding various aspects of and strategy relating to the contemplated
transaction with Duke Realty and regarding the discussions with Mr. Connor. In addition, during this period,
Mr. Moghadam discussed with members of the Prologis board the updates and proposed strategy regarding
the potential transaction with Duke Realty, including with respect to the proposed consideration.
On May 18, 2022, a representative of Goldman Sachs, on behalf of Prologis, contacted a representative of
Morgan Stanley to discuss a potential revised proposal with a mix of cash and stock consideration.
Following some back and forth discussions among such representatives of Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, the potential revised proposal was contemplated to consist of a mix of stock and cash whereby 90%
of a share of Duke Realty common stock would be converted into Prologis common stock based on an
exchange ratio of 0.466 and the remaining 10% of a share of Duke Realty common stock would receive $6.17
in cash, for total consideration of 0.419 of a share of Prologis common stock and $6.17 in cash for each
outstanding share of Duke Realty common stock (which together represented an implied value of $56.30 per
share of Duke Realty common stock based on the closing price of Prologis common stock on May 18, 2022).
Later on May 18, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley had a call with Mr. Connor to discuss the potential
revised proposal from Prologis communicated by representatives of Goldman Sachs. The consensus reached
on that call was that the potential revised proposal was not sufficiently compelling, and that Mr. Connor
would discuss the potential revised proposal with Mr. Stockert the following day and follow up with the
representatives of Morgan Stanley.
On May 19, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted Mr. Stockert to discuss the potential revised proposal
communicated by representatives of Goldman Sachs to representatives of Morgan Stanley on May 18 and
Mr. Connor’s subsequent discussions with representatives of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Connor and Mr. Stockert
agreed that this potential revised proposal would not be a sufficiently compelling proposal and that
representatives of Morgan Stanley should respond accordingly to representatives of Goldman Sachs.
Following this discussion, Mr. Connor contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley and instructed them to
notify the representatives of Goldman Sachs that this potential revised proposal including a cash component
would not be sufficiently compelling and that Prologis should focus on improving the exchange ratio.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On May 27, 2022, Mr. Connor and Mr. Stockert discussed proposed exchange ratios in a potential strategic
transaction. Mr. Stockert indicated that he had communicated with several members of the Duke Realty board
and they supported proposing an exchange ratio of 0.480 of a share of Prologis common stock for each share
of Duke Realty common stock.
On May 31, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted Mr. Moghadam to discuss the upcoming industry conference that
both companies would be attending as well as the possibility of both parties reengaging in private
discussions.
On June 1, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted Mr. Moghadam to further discuss the Prologis proposal. During this
discussion, Mr. Moghadam indicated that Prologis was willing to increase its proposal to 0.470 of a share of
Prologis common stock for each share of Duke Realty common stock. Mr. Connor informed Mr. Moghadam
that he believed members of the Duke Realty board would be prepared to approve of a transaction at an
exchange ratio of 0.480 of a share of Prologis common stock for each share of Duke Realty common stock.
After a lengthy discussion, Mr. Moghadam proposed an exchange ratio of 0.475 of a share of Prologis
common stock for each share of Duke Realty common stock (which represented an implied value of $59.78
per share of Duke Realty common stock based on the closing price of Prologis common stock on June 1,
2022), which we refer to as the “Final Proposal.” Mr. Connor responded that he would discuss the Final
Proposal with the Duke Realty board.
On June 2, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted several members of the Duke Realty board, including Mr. Stockert, to
discuss the Final Proposal. Such members of the Duke Realty board agreed that, based on the Final Proposal,
the parties should proceed with negotiating a mutual non-disclosure agreement and merger agreement and
conducting due diligence.
Later on June 2, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted Mr. Moghadam to inform him that he was prepared to
recommend to the Duke Realty board that it provide authorization to proceed with negotiating a mutual non-
disclosure agreement and merger agreement and conducting due diligence.
On June 3, 2022, the Duke Realty board met with members of the executive management team of Duke Realty
and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Hogan Lovells participating. At this meeting, representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Duke Realty board, among other topics, a comparison of Duke Realty’s
and Prologis’s relative share price performance and public market valuation levels and a preliminary financial
analysis of a potential combination with Prologis based on the Final Proposal. Representatives of Hogan
Lovells reviewed the Duke Realty board’s duties as directors under Indiana law when considering a potential
strategic transaction with Prologis. During the meeting, the Duke Realty board discussed these matters and
also discussed and considered the following alternatives to pursuing the potential stock-for-stock
transaction proposed by Prologis: (i) continuing to pursue Duke Realty’s existing business strategy as an
independent, standalone company, (ii) the viability of pursuing another strategic combination and (iii)
exploring a possible cash sale transaction. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed that there were
a limited number of potential strategic buyers that would have the capability to make an acquisition proposal
for Duke Realty. A discussion ensued among members of the Duke Realty board and representatives of
Morgan Stanley regarding whether any other potential strategic buyers would have both the financial ability
and the interest in making and closing on an acquisition proposal at a price greater than the Final Proposal.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley and the Duke Realty board also discussed potential financial buyers,
including Party A, and whether any such potential financial buyers would have both the financial ability and
the interest in making and closing on an acquisition proposal at a cash price more attractive than the Final
Proposal. The Duke Realty board noted that Party A had declined to engage in discussions regarding a
potential transaction with Duke Realty following Prologis’ public announcement of its proposal to acquire
Duke Realty. Following discussion, the Duke Realty board authorized management of Duke Realty to
continue negotiations with Prologis regarding a potential strategic transaction on the terms described and
discussed at the meeting. Later on June 3, 2022, Mr. Connor contacted Mr. Moghadam to inform him of the
outcome of the Duke Realty board meeting.
Also on June 3, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent to representatives of Hogan Lovells a draft
mutual non-disclosure agreement that did not request exclusivity or contain a standstill provision and a due
diligence request list. Later that day, Wachtell Lipton also sent Hogan Lovells a draft merger agreement,
which was generally consistent with other Prologis acquisition transactions. The draft merger
63 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreement (i) included generally reciprocal representations and warranties, customary interim operating
covenants and closing conditions, (ii) provided for one Duke Realty board seat on the Combined Company
board, (iii) provided that Duke Realty could continue to pay its quarterly dividend at a rate not to exceed
$0.28 per share per quarter and would align its dividend payments to Prologis’ dividend payments during the
period between signing and closing the potential transaction and (iv) included a mutual non-solicitation or
“no shop” restrictions on either party’s ability to solicit or negotiate alternative acquisition proposals, the
ability of Duke Realty to terminate the agreement to accept a superior proposal and related fiduciary
provisions, the ability of either party to change its recommendation to its stockholders due to a superior
proposal or an intervening event after signing and a mutual termination fee (equal to 3.75% of Duke Realty’s
transaction equity value) and expense reimbursement (up to $15 million) that would be payable by either
party under certain circumstances.
On June 4, 2022, the Prologis board held a meeting with members of the executive management team of
Prologis participating. Mr. Moghadam provided an update to the Prologis board regarding recent

with negotiating a mutual non-disclosure agreement and merger agreement and conducting due diligence at
an exchange ratio of 0.475 of a share of Prologis common stock for each share of Duke Realty common stock.
Members of Prologis management, including Mr. Moghadam, reviewed the strategic rationale for the
proposed transaction with the Prologis board and provided an overview of certain financial metrics of the
transaction. The Prologis board supported negotiating transaction agreements with Duke Realty and
proceeding with due diligence, and Prologis management agreed to keep the Prologis board apprised of
issues during the due diligence and negotiation period.
On June 4, 2022, representatives of Hogan Lovells sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a revised draft
mutual non-disclosure agreement that included a 30-day standstill provision. Later on June 4, 2022,
representatives of Hogan Lovells and representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed the mutual non-
disclosure agreement, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton proposed a revised draft mutual non-
disclosure agreement that included a 14-day standstill provision. Also, representatives of Wachtell Lipton,
Hogan Lovells and Alston & Bird LLP, legal advisor to Duke Realty, which we refer to as “Alston & Bird,”
discussed certain employee compensation matters in connection with a potential strategic transaction,
relating to, among other things, payment of 2022 annual bonuses, payment of severance to employees
terminated in connection with the potential transaction and payment of a “gross-up” in respect of any excise
taxes imposed on certain senior executives of Duke Realty under Section 4999 of the Code.
On June 5, 2022, following further discussions between representatives of Wachtell Lipton and
representatives of Hogan Lovells regarding the length of the standstill period, Prologis and Duke Realty
entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement that included a 21-day standstill provision (with customary
fall-away provisions) and customary mutual confidentiality restrictions.
From June 5, 2022 until the execution of the definitive merger agreement on June 11, 2022, the management
teams of Prologis and Duke Realty, together with their respective financial, legal and accounting advisors,
performed a diligence review with respect to the other company through a review of publicly available and
non-public information, including opening up virtual data rooms with due diligence information for each of
Prologis and Duke Realty on June 6, 2022, and held a series of discussions regarding diligence matters.

compensation matters, and two Duke Realty board seats on the Combined Company board. Later that day,
representatives of Hogan Lovells and representatives of Wachtell Lipton held a conference call to discuss
the merger agreement, including Duke Realty’s request for two representatives on the Combined Company’s
board and Prologis’ proposal of a $1 billion termination fee payable by Prologis in the event of a change of
recommendation by the Prologis board and Prologis’ desire that Duke Realty and Prologis align their
dividend payments during the period between signing and closing the potential transaction.
Later on June 7, 2022, Mr. Arndt, Mr. Denien, additional members of management of Duke Realty and
Prologis, and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs held a conference call to review each
company’s financial models. During such discussions, the reasonableness of each company’s projections
were reviewed and assessed, including discussions regarding the assumptions underlying such projections
and potential risks to those assumptions.
Also on June 7, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided representatives of Hogan Lovells with a
revised draft of the merger agreement. The revised draft merger agreement, among other things, rejected
Duke Realty’s request for two Duke Realty representatives on the Prologis board, revised the termination fee
payable by Prologis to $1 billion in the event of a change of recommendation by the Prologis board and
provided that if Prologis increased its dividend, Duke Realty would also be permitted to increase its quarterly
dividend by a corresponding amount if Duke Realty agreed to align its dividend payments to Prologis’
dividend payments during the period between signing and closing the potential transaction.
On June 8, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Hogan Lovells an initial draft of
Prologis’ disclosure schedules to the merger agreement.
On June 9, 2022, representatives of Hogan Lovells provided representatives of Wachtell Lipton with a

$3 billion termination fee payable by Prologis in the event of a change of recommendation by the Prologis
board and accepted Prologis’ proposal regarding dividend payments. Later that day, Duke Realty and
Prologis agreed on a $1.5 billion termination payable by Prologis in the event of a change of recommendation

rendering of an opinion regarding the fairness of the potential strategic transaction with Prologis.

director under Indiana law when considering a potential strategic transaction with Prologis. Duke Realty’s
executive management team and representatives of Hogan Lovells provided an update on the proposed final

analysis of the proposed transaction. During the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to
the Duke Realty board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June
11, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in such written opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Duke Realty common
stock (other than shares held by Prologis, Duke Realty or any of their respective subsidiaries). The opinion
of Morgan Stanley is more fully described in the section entitled “The Mergers - Opinion of Duke Realty’s
Financial Advisor”. The Duke Realty board, with the advice and assistance of its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel and Duke Realty’s executive management team, evaluated and discussed the terms of
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as well as the value and significant
premium provided by the exchange ratio. Following these presentations and discussions, and other

obligation to recommend that its stockholders vote to approve the Prologis common stock issuance
proposal, subject to certain fiduciary-out provisions and termination payments. Representatives of Goldman
Sachs reviewed with the Prologis board Goldman Sachs’ financial analysis summarized below under “-
Opinion of Prologis’ Financial Advisor” and rendered to the Prologis board its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion dated June 11, 2022, to the effect that, as of the date of

and discussions, and other discussions by the Prologis board concerning, among other things, the matters
described below under “The Mergers - Recommendation of the Prologis Board of Directors and its Reasons
for the Mergers,” the Prologis board, by a unanimous vote of all directors, on behalf of Prologis, Prologis OP,
Prologis Merger Sub and Prologis OP Merger Sub, then (i) determined and declared that the merger
agreement, the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and
in the best interests of Prologis and its stockholders, (ii) approved the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, (iii) directed that the Prologis common stock
issuance proposal be submitted for consideration at a meeting of the Prologis stockholders and (iv) resolved
to recommend that the Prologis stockholders vote to approve the Prologis common stock issuance on the
terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement.
On the afternoon of June 11, 2022, Duke Realty and Prologis executed and delivered the merger agreement.
On the morning of June 13, 2022, prior to the opening of trading of Duke Realty common stock and Prologis
common stock on the NYSE, Duke Realty and Prologis issued a joint press release publicly announcing the
mergers and execution of the merger agreement.
After becoming aware that certain adjustments needed to be made to certain calculations affecting the
Goldman Sachs financial analysis presented to the Prologis board at the June 11, 2022 meeting of the
Prologis board, primarily relating to (i) discount periods not fully corresponding with the timing of cash
flows and (ii) a misapplication of Duke Realty’s forward EBITDA growth in the standalone terminal value
calculation (as set forth in more detail in the section entitled “- Opinion of Prologis’ Financial Advisor”), on
July 13, 2022, Goldman Sachs presented an updated financial analysis reflecting such adjusted calculations
to the Prologis board and confirmed that, had Goldman Sachs performed its financial analysis set forth in the
June 11 presentation using such adjusted calculations, there would have been no change to the conclusion
set forth in Goldman Sachs’ fairness opinion that was delivered on June 11, 2022, as described above. The
Prologis board considered the updated information and discussed the updated information with
representatives of Goldman Sachs and, taking into account the totality of the information available to it,
concluded that the updated analysis did not impact the Prologis board’s assessment of the mergers or its
decision to unanimously approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and,
accordingly, the Prologis board unanimously affirmed its recommendation that the Prologis stockholders
approve the Prologis common stock issuance proposal.",67,78

In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, the
Prologis board consulted with Prologis’ senior management and its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors and unanimously determined and declared that the merger agreement, the mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Prologis and its
stockholders. The Prologis board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and unanimously recommends that the Prologis stockholders vote to approve the
Prologis common stock issuance on the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement.
In determining that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the
best interests of Prologis and its stockholders, in approving the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and in recommending that Prologis stockholders vote to approve the Prologis common
stock issuance on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, the Prologis board considered various factors
that it viewed as supporting its decisions, including the following material factors:
its belief that Duke Realty’s logistics assets are highly complementary to Prologis’ U.S. portfolio and
that Prologis will gain high quality properties for its portfolio in key geographies, including Southern
California, New Jersey, South Florida, Chicago, Dallas and Atlanta;
its expectation that the strategic fit between the Prologis and Duke Realty portfolios will allow
Prologis to capture significant cost and revenue synergies, including approximately $310 to $370
million from immediate corporate general and administrative cost savings, operating leverage, lower
interest expense and lease adjustments while offering its customers more choice, flexibility and
product offerings as a result of the combined portfolios;

that, at the company merger effective time, Duke Realty Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James
B. Connor, is expected to join the Prologis board, and Prologis will therefore benefit from Mr.
Connor’s significant experience and expertise with respect to the logistics real estate business and
Duke Realty’s assets;
that, following the mergers and except with respect to the addition of Mr. Connor to the Prologis
board, there will be no changes to the Prologis board or executive management team, with Hamid R.

No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”;
the merger agreement’s provisions requiring Duke Realty to pay Prologis a termination fee of $775
million and/or reimburse Prologis’ transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million if the
merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances;
the historical and then-current trading prices and volumes of shares of each of Prologis common
stock and Duke Realty common stock;

of the merger agreement and the completion of the company merger for Prologis to conduct its
business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;
the commitment on the part of each of Prologis and Duke Realty to complete the mergers as reflected
in their respective obligations under the terms of the merger agreement and the absence of any
significant closing conditions under the merger agreement, other than the approval of Duke Realty
shareholders and Prologis stockholders, and the likelihood that the mergers will be completed on a
timely basis; and
the other terms and conditions of the merger agreement.
The Prologis board also considered a number of risks and other factors identified in its deliberations as
weighing negatively against the mergers, including the following:
the risk of not capturing all of the anticipated estimated cost and long-term revenue synergies and the
risk that other anticipated benefits of the mergers might not be realized on the expected time frame or
at all;
the risk that the mergers might not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including as a result of
the failure to obtain Prologis stockholder approval or Duke Realty shareholder approval, or the failure
of Prologis or Duke Realty to satisfy other conditions to closing the mergers, and that such failure
could negatively affect the price of Prologis common stock and future business and financial results;
the risk of diverting management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic
opportunities while working to implement the mergers;
the restrictions on the conduct of Prologis’ business during the period between the execution of the
merger agreement and the consummation of the mergers (or, if applicable, the termination of the
merger agreement);
the costs to be incurred in connection with the mergers and related transactions;
the risk that Prologis or Duke Realty may be unable to retain key employees;
the potential impact on the market price of Prologis common stock as a result of the issuance of the
merger consideration to Duke Realty shareholders;
restrictions on Prologis’ ability to solicit acquisition proposals, engage in negotiations or discussions
concerning, or provide any non-public information or data to any person or entity relating to, an
acquisition proposal and enter into any agreement relating to any acquisition proposal, as further
discussed in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Covenants and Agreements - No
Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals”;
the merger agreement’s provisions requiring Prologis to pay Duke Realty a termination fee of $1.5
billion and/or reimburse Duke Realty’s transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million if
the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances;
the merger agreement’s provisions permitting Duke Realty to terminate the merger agreement prior to
the receipt of the Duke Realty shareholder approval to enter into an acquisition agreement with
respect to a superior proposal (subject to compliance with the provisions of the merger agreement
regarding non-solicitation of acquisition proposals) upon payment by Duke Realty to Prologis of a
termination fee of $775 million; and
the risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Prologis board is not intended to be exhaustive and
may not include all the factors considered by the Prologis board. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and the complexity of these matters, the Prologis
board did not attempt to quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the factors that
it considered in reaching its determination to approve the mergers and the merger agreement. In addition,
individual members of the Prologis board may have given differing weights to different factors. The

Prologis board conducted an overall review of the factors described above and other factors, including
through discussions with, and inquiry of, Prologis’ management and outside legal and financial advisors.
After consideration of these factors, the Prologis board determined that, overall, the potential benefits of the
mergers outweighed the potential risks. Accordingly, the Prologis board unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, and unanimously recommends
that the Prologis stockholders vote FOR the Prologis common stock issuance proposal.",78,81

In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers, the
Duke Realty board consulted with Duke Realty’s senior management and its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors and unanimously determined that the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Duke Realty and its shareholders, and Duke
Realty OP and its limited partners. The Duke Realty board has unanimously approved the mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, has unanimously approved and adopted the
merger agreement, and unanimously recommends that the Duke Realty shareholders vote in favor of the
Duke Realty merger agreement proposal.
In determining that the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are
advisable and in the best interests of Duke Realty and its shareholders, and Duke Realty OP and its limited
partners, in approving the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on the
terms set forth in the merger agreement, in approving and adopting the merger agreement, and in
recommending that Duke Realty shareholders vote in favor of the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal,
the Duke Realty board considered various factors that it viewed as supporting its decisions, including the
following material factors:
the receipt of Prologis common stock as merger consideration provides Duke Realty shareholders
with the opportunity to have an ownership stake in the Combined Company, which is expected to
provide a number of significant potential strategic opportunities and benefits, including the
following:
the mergers combine two highly complementary portfolios, allowing the Combined Company to
capture significant cost and revenue synergies while offering its customers more choice,
flexibility and product offerings as a result of the combined portfolios; and
the Combined Company will be among the largest publicly traded United States REITs based on
equity market capitalization, and its meaningful scale and investment-grade rating are expected to
allow it to capitalize on corporate and operating cost efficiencies and to gain more efficient
access to less expensive capital;
the information with respect to the business, operating results and financial condition of Prologis, on
both historical and prospective bases, including Prologis’ operating performance, the quality, breadth
and experience of Prologis’ senior management team, and the complementary markets served by the
two companies, as well as the Duke Realty board’s knowledge of the current and prospective
environment in which the two companies operate, including industry, economic and market
conditions, taking into account the results of Duke Realty’s due diligence review of Prologis
(including with respect to operational, legal, financial, environmental and tax matters);
current market and industry trends, Duke Realty’s future prospects as an independent company and
the challenges and risks that could affect Duke Realty’s future performance;
the merger consideration had an implied value per share of Duke Realty common stock of $62.88,
which represented a premium of approximately 31.8% to Duke Realty’s common stock price, based on
closing prices on May 9, 2022, the last trading day prior to Prologis’ public announcement of its
proposal to acquire Duke Realty;
the historical and then-current trading prices and volumes of shares of each of Duke Realty common
stock and Prologis common stock;
the exchange ratio is fixed and will not fluctuate as a result of changes in the market price of Duke
Realty common stock or Prologis common stock, which provides certainty as to the pro forma

percentage ownership of the Combined Company that the Duke Realty shareholders would receive in
the company merger;
the expectation that upon completion of the mergers, Duke Realty shareholders will own
approximately 20% of the common stock of the Combined Company;
the merger consideration, consisting of Prologis common stock, which will be listed for trading on the
NYSE, continues to provide liquidity for Duke Realty shareholders after the mergers;
the opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated June 11, 2022, to the Duke Realty board as to the fairness, from
a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of shares of Duke Realty
common stock (other than shares held by Prologis, Duke Realty or any of their respective
subsidiaries) of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement, as more fully described below in
the section entitled “The Mergers - Opinion of Duke Realty’s Financial Advisor”;
the expectation that, assuming that the company merger qualifies as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code, holders of shares of Duke Realty common stock that are United States holders
generally will not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes upon the
receipt of Prologis common stock in exchange for shares of Duke Realty common stock in connection
with the company merger, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Prologis
common stock;
Duke Realty’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James B. Connor, is expected to be appointed to
the Prologis board at the company merger effective time, helping to oversee the ongoing equity
investment of Duke Realty shareholders and providing an opportunity for the Combined Company to
benefit from Mr. Connor’s significant experience and expertise with respect to the logistics real estate
business and Duke Realty’s assets;
the company merger is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Duke Realty common stock entitled to vote on the approval of the merger agreement;
the merger agreement permits Duke Realty to continue to pay its shareholders regular quarterly
dividends of up to $0.28 per share of Duke Realty common stock (which dividend amount may be
increased by a corresponding amount (of not more than 15%) for the same quarterly period in which
Prologis makes an increase in its quarterly dividend) until the company merger effective time;
based on the current dividend rates of Duke Realty and Prologis and the exchange ratio in the
company merger, Duke Realty shareholders are expected to benefit from an increased dividend rate
following the mergers;
the merger agreement provides Duke Realty with the ability, under certain specified circumstances, to
consider an unsolicited acquisition proposal if the Duke Realty board determines such proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and concludes in good
faith that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with their duties
as directors under applicable law, and the merger agreement provides the Duke Realty board with the
ability, under certain specified circumstances, to make a change in recommendation or to terminate the
merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal upon
payment of a termination fee to Prologis in an amount equal to $775 million;
the merger agreement provides Duke Realty with sufficient operating flexibility between the signing of
the merger agreement and the company merger effective time for Duke Realty to conduct its business
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;
the commitment on the part of each of Duke Realty and Prologis to complete the mergers as reflected
in their respective obligations under the merger agreement and the absence of any significant closing
conditions under the terms of the merger agreement, other than the approval of Duke Realty
shareholders and Prologis stockholders, and the likelihood that the mergers will be completed on a
timely basis;
the merger agreement requires Prologis to pay Duke Realty a termination fee of $1.5 billion and/or
reimburse Duke Realty’s transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million if the merger
agreement is terminated under specified circumstances;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the other terms of the merger agreement, including representations, warranties and covenants of the
parties, as well as the conditions to their respective obligations under the merger agreement;
the mergers would be in the best interests of Duke Realty shareholders in light of the expected long-
term strategic and financial benefits associated with the combination of Duke Realty and Prologis, the
ability of Duke Realty shareholders to continue to benefit from the prospects of the Combined
Company, the overall terms of the merger agreement and transactions contemplated thereby and the
timing, likelihood and risks of completing alternative transactions, including the business,
competition, industry and market risks that would apply to Duke Realty and the mergers, as compared
to potential alternatives, including the continued independent operation of Duke Realty and Duke
Realty’s prospects for a merger or sale transaction with a company other than Prologis and the
potential terms for such other transactions as more particularly described in this proxy statement/​
prospectus under “The Mergers - Background of the Mergers”; and
the course of negotiations with Prologis, which were conducted at arm’s length and during which the
Duke Realty board was advised by its legal and financial advisors, including that the negotiations
resulted in an improved offer.
The Duke Realty board also considered a number of risks and other potentially negative factors in
considering the merger agreement, the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the following:
following the completion of the company merger, Duke Realty would no longer exist as an
independent public company and Duke Realty shareholders would be able to participate in any future
earnings growth Duke Realty might have achieved solely through their ownership of Prologis
common stock;
because the merger consideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Prologis common stock that
will not fluctuate as a result of changes in the market price of Duke Realty common stock or Prologis
common stock prior to the company merger effective time, the market value of the merger
consideration could decrease prior to the company merger effective time if the trading price of
Prologis common stock decreases;
the risk that the anticipated cost and long-term revenue synergies and other benefits to the Duke
Realty shareholders expected to result from the mergers might not be fully realized or not realized at
all, including as a result of possible changes in the real estate market or the industrial real estate
business affecting the markets in which the Combined Company will operate or as a result of potential
difficulties integrating the two companies and their respective operations;
the risk that a different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial to Duke Realty
shareholders than the proposed mergers;
under the terms of the merger agreement, Duke Realty must pay to Prologis a termination fee in an
amount of $775 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, which might
discourage or deter other parties from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more
advantageous to Duke Realty shareholders;
under the terms of the merger agreement, if Duke Realty shareholders vote on, but do not approve,
the company merger, and the merger agreement is thereafter terminated, Duke Realty may be required
to reimburse Prologis’ transaction expenses up to an amount equal to $15 million, regardless of
whether an alternative transaction is available to Duke Realty;
the terms of the merger agreement place limitations on the ability of Duke Realty to solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer by
or with a third party with respect to a competing transaction and to furnish information to, or enter
into discussions with, a third party interested in pursuing an alternative strategic transaction;
the risk that one or more of the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the mergers will not
be satisfied or waived;
the risk of diverting management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic
opportunities as well as causing significant distractions for Duke Realty’s employees while working
to implement the mergers, which may result in harm to Duke Realty’s business if the mergers do not
close;

the risk that the mergers may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including as a result of the
failure to obtain Prologis stockholder approval or Duke Realty shareholder approval, or the failure of
Prologis or Duke Realty to satisfy other conditions to closing the mergers;
the risk that failure to complete the mergers could negatively affect the price of Duke Realty common
stock and/or the future business and financial results of Duke Realty;
the terms of the merger agreement provide the Prologis board with the right to change its
recommendation regarding the approval of the Prologis common stock issuance proposal under
certain circumstances (subject to the payment of a $1.5 billion termination fee to Duke Realty in the
event Duke Realty terminates the merger agreement as a result and prior to receipt of Prologis
stockholder approval);
the risk that if Prologis stockholders fail to approve the Prologis common stock issuance proposal or
Duke Realty shareholders fail to approve the Duke Realty merger agreement proposal, then Prologis
may terminate the merger agreement;
provisions in the merger agreement placing certain restrictions on the operation of Duke Realty’s
business during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the company merger
effective time may delay or prevent Duke Realty from undertaking business opportunities that may
arise or other actions it would otherwise take with respect to its operations absent the pending
completion of the mergers;
Duke Realty and Prologis may be obligated to complete the mergers without having obtained
appropriate consents, approvals or waivers from the counterparties under certain of Duke Realty’s
contracts that require consent or approval to consummate the mergers, and the risk that such
consummation could trigger the termination of, or default under, such contracts or the exercise of
rights by the counterparties under such contracts;
the risk of litigation relating to the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement;
certain of Duke Realty’s directors and named executive officers have certain interests in the mergers
that might be different from the interests of Duke Realty shareholders generally as described under
the section entitled “The Mergers - Interests of Duke Realty’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Mergers”;
the costs to be incurred in connection with the mergers and related transactions; and
the risks described under the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Duke Realty board is not intended to be exhaustive
and may not include all the factors considered by the Duke Realty board. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered by the Duke Realty board in evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the company merger, and the complexity of these matters,

At a meeting of the Prologis board, Goldman Sachs rendered to the Prologis board its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion dated June 11, 2022, to the effect that, as of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to Prologis.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated June 11, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with
the opinion, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. The summary of the Goldman Sachs
opinion contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and
assistance of the Prologis board in connection with its consideration of the mergers and the opinion does not
constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Prologis common stock should vote with respect to the
Prologis common stock issuance proposal or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,
Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:
the merger agreement;
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Prologis and Duke Realty for the
five years ended December 31, 2021;
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Prologis and Duke
Realty;
certain other communications from Prologis and Duke Realty to their respective stockholders;
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Prologis and Duke Realty;
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Duke Realty on a standalone basis prepared by its
management; and
certain financial analyses and forecasts for Duke Realty on a standalone basis and giving effect to
the company merger and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Prologis on a standalone
and on a pro-forma basis giving effect to the company merger, in each case, as prepared by the
management of Prologis and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Prologis, which collectively we
refer to in this section as the “Forecasts”, including certain operating synergies projected by the
management of Prologis to result from the company merger, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by
Prologis, which we refer to in this section as the “Synergies”  (as described in the sections entitled “-
Certain Prologis Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” and “- Certain Duke Realty Unaudited
Prologis Prospective Financial Information).”
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of Prologis and Duke Realty
regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of Duke Realty and with the members of senior management of Prologis regarding their
assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Prologis
and the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the company merger; reviewed the reported price
and trading activity for the shares of Prologis common stock and shares of Duke Realty common stock;
compared certain financial and stock market information for Prologis and Duke Realty with similar information
for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain
recent business combinations in the real estate industry; and performed such other studies and analyses,
and considered such other factors, as Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Prologis board, relied upon
and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and
other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent
of the Prologis board that the Forecasts, including the Synergies, were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Prologis. Goldman
Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any
contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Prologis, Prologis OP, Duke Realty
or Duke Realty OP or any of their respective subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any
74 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the company merger would be obtained without any
adverse effect on Prologis, Prologis OP, Duke Realty, Duke Realty OP or on the expected benefits of the
company merger in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs’ analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the
company merger would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver
or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Prologis to engage in the
company merger, or the relative merits of the company merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that
may be available to Prologis; nor did it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view to Prologis, as of the date of
Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs did
not express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement
or the company merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the
merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the company merger, including, the
partnership merger, the contribution, any distribution to the stockholders of Prologis, or the fairness of the
company merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of Prologis; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Prologis, Prologis OP,
Duke Realty or Duke Realty OP, or any class of such persons, in connection with the company merger,
whether relative to the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs did not
express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock
would trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on
Prologis, Prologis OP, Duke Realty or Duke Realty OP, or as to the impact of the company merger on the
solvency or viability of Prologis, Prologis OP, Duke Realty or Duke Realty OP or the ability of Prologis,
Prologis OP, Duke Realty or Duke Realty OP to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs, as of, the date of Goldman Sachs’ written
opinion, and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion
based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion.
Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the
Prologis board in connection with its consideration of the company merger and Goldman Sachs’ opinion
does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Prologis common stock should vote
with respect to the company merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness
committee of Goldman Sachs.
Following Goldman Sachs’ presentation to the Prologis board of directors on June 11, 2022, which we refer to
in this section as the “June 11 Presentation,” Goldman Sachs determined that certain items affecting the
discounted cash flow analyses and the present value of future share price analyses, on both a standalone
and pro forma basis, needed to be adjusted. These adjustments primarily related to (i) discount periods not
fully corresponding with the timing of cash flows and (ii) a misapplication of Duke Realty’s forward EBITDA
(as defined below) growth in the Duke Realty standalone terminal value calculation. Goldman Sachs
subsequently performed such analyses, as of June 11, 2022, using the adjusted calculations, which we refer
to in this section as the “Adjusted Calculations.” Such subsequent analyses performed by Goldman Sachs
do not address any circumstances, developments or events occurring after June 11, 2022, which is the date
of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, other than in relation to the Adjusted Calculations and, except as
described herein, Goldman Sachs’ opinion set forth in its written opinion letter was provided only as of such
date. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, on July 7, 2022, Goldman Sachs confirmed to the Prologis
board that, had Goldman Sachs performed its financial analysis set forth in the June 11 Presentation using
the Adjusted Calculations, there would have been no change to the conclusion set forth in the written
opinion of Goldman Sachs dated June 11, 2022.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the Prologis
board of directors in connection with rendering to the Prologis board the opinion described above. The
following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses

performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or
weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include
information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary
and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted,
the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data
as it existed on or before June 10, 2022, the last trading day prior to Goldman Sachs’ delivery of its opinion to
the Prologis board, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Implied Premia
Goldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia using the closing price for shares of Prologis
common stock and Duke Realty common stock on June 10, 2022, and the implied value of the merger
consideration to be paid by Prologis for each share of Duke Realty common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement.
For purposes of its analysis, Goldman Sachs calculated implied values for the merger consideration of (a)
$58.85 by multiplying the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement by $123.90, an illustrative equity
value per share of Prologis common stock calculated as the closing price for the shares of Prologis common
stock on May 9, 2022, the last trading day before Prologis announced its offer to acquire Duke Realty,
adjusted to track the average share price performance of the selected companies set forth below under “-
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis” since such date through June 10, 2022, which we refer to in
this section as the “Prologis Peer-Adjusted Unaffected Price,” and (b) $55.69 by multiplying the exchange
ratio pursuant to the merger agreement by $117.24, the closing price for the shares of Prologis common stock
on June 10, 2022.
Goldman Sachs calculated and/or compared the implied premia represented by the $58.85 and $55.69 implied
values of the merger consideration described in the previous paragraph, relative to:
$44.66, an illustrative equity value per share of Duke Realty common stock calculated as the closing
price for the shares of Duke Realty common stock on May 9, 2022, adjusted to reflect the average
share price performance of the selected companies set forth below under “- Selected Publicly Traded
Companies Analysis” since such date through June 10, 2022, which we refer to in this section as the
“Duke Realty Peer-Adjusted Unaffected Price”;
$65.64, the highest closing price for shares of Duke Realty common stock over the 52-week period
ended May 9, 2022; and
$67.00, the median broker price target on May 9, 2022.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis for Duke Realty on a Standalone Basis
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of Duke Realty
to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock, both without taking
into account the Synergies and taking into account the Synergies.
Using discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 8.0%, reflecting estimates of Duke Realty’s weighted average cost
of capital, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common
stock, by discounting to present value as of March 31, 2022, (i) estimates of the unlevered free cash flows to
be generated by Duke Realty on a standalone basis, both without taking into account the

Synergies and taking into account the Synergies, for the period from April 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026, as
reflected in the Forecasts, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Duke Realty, as of December 31,
2026, calculated by applying exit terminal year multiples ranging from 25.0x to 28.0x to estimated 1-year
forward adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which we refer to in this
section as “EBITDA,” to be generated by Duke Realty, both without taking into account the Synergies and
taking into account the Synergies, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis implied (i) as set forth in the
June 11 Presentation, perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.3% both without taking into account
the Synergies and taking into account the Synergies and (ii) using the Adjusted Calculations, perpetuity
growth rates ranging from 3.4% to 4.7% without taking into account the Synergies, and 3.4% to 4.6% taking
into account the Synergies). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the capital asset
pricing model (“CAPM”), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Duke Realty’s target
capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any,
future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Duke Realty, as well as certain financial metrics for the
United States financial markets generally. The range of exit terminal year multiples was estimated by Goldman
Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience taking into account historical trading multiples of
Prologis and Duke Realty and the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth below under “-
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis”.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Duke Realty by adding the ranges of
present values it calculated for the unlevered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described
above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the ranges of illustrative enterprise values it derived the net
debt of Duke Realty as of March 31, 2022, as reflected in Duke Realty’s consolidated balance sheet as of that
date, to derive ranges of illustrative equity values for Duke Realty, both without taking into account the
Synergies and taking into account the Synergies. Goldman Sachs then divided the ranges of illustrative
equity values it derived for Duke Realty on a standalone basis by the implied number of fully diluted shares
of Duke Realty common stock estimated to be outstanding as of June 8, 2022, as provided by Duke Realty
management, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock. As set
forth in the June 11 Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of
Duke Realty common stock of $55.35 to $67.92 without taking into account the Synergies, and a range of
illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock of $66.00 to $80.11 taking into account the
Synergies. Using the Adjusted Calculations, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per
share of Duke Realty common stock of $61.55 to $75.57 without taking into account the Synergies, and a
range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock of $72.86 to $88.59 taking into
account the Synergies.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis for Duke Realty on a Standalone Basis
Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of
Duke Realty common stock, based on theoretical future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for the shares of
Duke Realty common stock.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of Duke Realty common
stock as of December 31 of each of 2022 through 2025 by applying price to next twelve months’ AFFO
multiples ranging from 27.0x to 33.0x to estimates of the AFFO per share of Duke Realty for each of fiscal
years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively, as reflected in the Forecasts. By applying a discount rate of
8.2%, reflecting an estimate of Duke Realty’s cost of equity, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value, as
of March 31, 2022, and summed, both the theoretical future values per share of Duke Realty common stock it
derived for each applicable year and the estimated dividends to be paid per share of Duke Realty common
stock on a standalone basis through the end of the applicable year as reflected in the Forecasts, to yield
illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock. As set forth in the June 11 Presentation,
this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Duke Realty common stock of
$49.91 to $67.38. Using the Adjusted Calculations, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present
values per share of Duke Realty common stock of $49.64 to $70.54.
The illustrative price to next twelve months’ AFFO multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by
Goldman Sachs using its professional judgement and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated
by Goldman Sachs as set forth below under “- Selected Publicly Traded Companies

CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Duke Realty, as well as certain
financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
Illustrative Implied Premia of Precedent REIT Transactions
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the premia paid in certain
acquisition transactions of publicly traded real estate investment trust companies in the United States and
Canada announced since 2017 in which the target company had an implied enterprise value of greater than
$500 million (excluding the Blackstone Group / Bluerock Residential Growth REIT transaction and the Pretium
& Ares Management / Front Yard Residential transaction).
For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the yearly average,
high and low premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the closing stock prices of the target
involved in the transaction on the trading day prior to the date on which such transaction was announced or
a news report, management commentary, public filing, or other public disclosure regarding such transaction
occurred, which we refer to as the “Unaffected date.” The following table presents the results of this
analysis:

reflecting the lowest and the highest one-day premia in the period from 2017 to 2022, to the Duke Realty Peer-
Adjusted Unaffected Price of $44.66, to derive a range of illustrative implied values per share of Duke Realty
common stock of $48.19 to $68.36.
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared, using publicly available data obtained from Bloomberg and CapIQ,
certain financial information and public market multiples for Prologis to corresponding financial information
and public market multiples for Duke Realty and the selected publicly traded real estate investment trust
companies listed below, which we refer to in this section as the “selected companies.” Although none of the
selected companies or Duke Realty is directly comparable to Prologis, the selected companies and Duke
Realty were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of
analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of Prologis.
For each of Prologis, Duke Realty and the selected companies, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared:
the closing price per share, as of June 10, 2022, as a multiple of the next twelve months’, which we
refer to as “NTM,” AFFO for such company, which we refer to in the table below as “NTM P/AFFO - 
Current”;
the closing price per share, as of May 9, 2022, as a multiple of NTM AFFO for such company, which
we refer to in the table below as “NTM P/AFFO - Unaffected”;
the average of each company’s historical price to NTM AFFO multiples for the 1 year and 3 years
ended June 10, 2022, which we refer to in the table below as “NTM P/AFFO - Last 1 Year Average”
and “NTM P/AFFO - Last 3 Year Average,” respectively, and for the period from May 9, 2019 through

June 10, 2022, as a multiple of the estimated NTM EBITDA for such company, which we refer to in the
table below as “NTM EV/EBITDA - Current”;
the implied enterprise value of each company, based on such company’s closing price per share, as of
May 9, 2022, as a multiple of the estimated NTM EBITDA for such company, which we refer to in the

2019 through February 21, 2020, which we refer to in the table below as “NTM EV/EBITDA - Pre-
COVID Average”.
Goldman Sachs calculated an implied enterprise value for each of Prologis, Duke Realty and the selected
companies by multiplying its closing share price as the applicable date by the number of fully diluted shares
of the company to derive an implied equity value for each company, and adding to the resulting implied
equity value the amount of each company’s net debt and the value of its noncontrolling interests, based on
information in the applicable company’s publicly available filings as well as information obtained from
Bloomberg and CapIQ. For purposes of its calculations, Goldman Sachs used estimates of AFFO and
EBITDA for Prologis, Duke Realty and each of the selected companies based on the median analyst
estimates as of June 10, 2022 obtained from Bloomberg and CapIQ.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis for Prologis on a Standalone Basis and Pro Forma
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of Prologis to
derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis common stock, both on a standalone basis
and pro forma giving effect to the transaction.
Using discount rates ranging from 6.5% to 7.5%, reflecting estimates of Prologis’s weighted average cost of
capital, Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis common stock, by
discounting to present value as of March 31, 2022, (i) estimates of the unlevered free cash flows to be
generated by Prologis, both on a standalone basis and pro forma giving effect to the transaction, for the
period from April 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026, as reflected in the Forecasts, and (ii) a range of illustrative
terminal values for Prologis as of December 31, 2026, calculated by applying exit terminal year multiples
ranging from 25.0x to 28.0x to 1-year forward adjusted EBITDA to be generated by Prologis, both on a
standalone basis and pro forma giving effect to the transaction, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis
implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.2% to 4.5%). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by
application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Prologis’s target capital
structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future
applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Prologis, as well as certain financial metrics for the United
States financial markets generally. The range of exit terminal year multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs
utilizing its professional judgment and experience taking into account historical trading multiples of Prologis
and Duke Realty and the multiples calculated by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under “- Selected
Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.”
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Prologis by adding the ranges of present
values it calculated for the unlevered free cash flow and illustrative terminal values, as described above.
Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the ranges of illustrative enterprise values it derived (i) for Prologis on
a standalone basis, the net debt of Prologis as of March 31, 2022, as reflected in Prologis’s consolidated
balance sheet as of that date, and (ii) for Prologis pro forma giving effect to the transaction, the net debt of
Prologis as of March 31, 2022, as reflected in Prologis’s consolidated balance sheet as of that date and the
net debt of Duke Realty as of March 31, 2022, as reflected in Duke Realty’s consolidated balance sheet as of
that date, to derive ranges of illustrative equity values for Prologis, both on a standalone basis and pro
forma giving effect to the transaction. Goldman Sachs then divided the ranges of illustrative equity values it
derived, (i) for Prologis on a standalone basis, by the implied number of fully diluted shares of Prologis
common stock estimated to be outstanding as of June 8, 2022, as provided by Prologis management, and (ii)
for Prologis pro forma giving effect to the transaction, by the implied number of fully diluted shares of
Prologis common stock estimated to be outstanding as of June 8, 2022, as provided by Prologis management,
plus the estimated number of shares of Prologis common stock to be issued as merger consideration, as
provided by Prologis management, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis
common stock on a standalone basis and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the transaction. As set forth
in the June 11 Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis
common stock on a standalone basis of $167.27 to $197.82, and a range of illustrative present values per
share of Prologis common stock on a pro forma basis giving effect to the transaction of $169.60 to $200.88.
Using the Adjusted Calculations, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of
Prologis common stock on a standalone basis of $159.36 to $189.71, and a range of illustrative present values
per share of Prologis common stock on a pro forma basis giving effect to the transaction of $161.21 to
$192.33.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Goldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share for the shares of Prologis common
stock as of December 31 of each of 2022 through 2025, both on a standalone basis and pro forma giving
effect to the transaction, by applying price to next twelve months’ AFFO multiples ranging from 30.0x to 36.0x
to estimates of the AFFO per share of Prologis for each of fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026,
respectively, both on a standalone basis and pro forma giving effect to the transaction, as reflected in the
Forecasts. By applying a discount rate of 7.6%, reflecting an estimate of Prologis’s cost of equity, Goldman
Sachs discounted to present value, as of March 31, 2022, and summed, both the theoretical future values per
share of Prologis common stock it derived for each applicable year and the estimated dividends to be paid
per share of Prologis common stock through the end of the applicable year, in each case, both on a
standalone basis and pro forma giving effect to the transaction, as reflected in the Forecasts, to yield
illustrative present values per share of Prologis common stock on a standalone basis. As set forth in the
June 11 Presentation, this analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis
common stock of $123.54 to $167.24, and a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis common
stock pro forma giving effect to the transaction of $127.06 to $173.43. Using the Adjusted Calculations, this
analysis indicated a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis common stock of $122.77 to
$176.14, and a range of illustrative present values per share of Prologis common stock pro forma giving effect
to the transaction of $126.29 to $182.33.
The illustrative price to next twelve months’ AFFO multiples used in the foregoing analysis were derived by
Goldman Sachs using its professional judgement and experience, taking into account the multiples calculated
by Goldman Sachs as set forth above under “- Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.” Goldman
Sachs derived the discount rate used in the foregoing analysis by application of the CAPM, which requires
certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Prologis, as well as certain financial metrics for the
United States financial markets generally.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,
without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying
Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all
of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Prologis or Duke Realty or the transaction.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ provision of its opinion to the
Prologis board as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of Prologis common stock of
the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do
they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based
upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties or their respective advisors, none of Prologis, Duke Realty, Goldman Sachs or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The exchange ratio was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Prologis and Duke Realty
and was approved by the Prologis board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Prologis during these
negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to Prologis or the
Prologis board or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio for the
transaction.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Prologis board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Prologis board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Duke Realty and
Prologis and their financial and legal advisors;
reviewed a draft, dated June 11, 2022, of the merger agreement and certain related documents; and
performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed
appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied, or otherwise made
available to Morgan Stanley by Duke Realty and Prologis, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion.
With respect to the Financial Projections and the Synergies, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then currently available estimates and judgments of the
respective managements of Duke Realty and Prologis of the future financial performance of Duke Realty and
Prologis. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by Duke Realty
management of: (i) the Synergies, (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of Duke Realty and
Prologis and (iii) the ability to retain key employees of Duke Realty and Prologis, respectively. In addition,
Morgan Stanley assumed that the mergers will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among
other things, (i) that the company merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, (ii) that the partnership merger will qualify as and constitute an “assets over” form of merger
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i) and (iii) that the definitive merger agreement would not
differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed
that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and
consents required for the proposed mergers, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed
consents required for the proposed mergers, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed
that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the
proposed mergers. Morgan Stanley has been advised by the managements of Duke Realty and Prologis,
respectively, that each of Duke Realty and Prologis, respectively, has been organized and operated in
conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856
of the Code since its formation, and Morgan Stanley assumed that the mergers will not adversely affect the
status of either Duke Realty or Prologis as a REIT (in the case of Duke Realty, through its final taxable year
that will end with the company merger). Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan
Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Duke
Realty and Prologis and their legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters.
Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of Duke Realty, or any class of such persons, relative
to the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Duke Realty common stock in the transaction
(other than the holders of the Excluded Shares). Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits
of the mergers as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or
not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent
valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Duke Realty or Prologis, nor was Morgan Stanley
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on
financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
Morgan Stanley as of June 11, 2022. Events occurring after June 11, 2022 may affect Morgan Stanley’s
opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection
with its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter to the Duke Realty board of directors
dated June 11, 2022. The following summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed
and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses
described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. The various analyses
summarized below were based on the closing prices for shares of Duke Realty common stock and shares of
Prologis common stock as of May 9, 2022, the last trading day prior to Prologis’ public announcement of its
offer to acquire Duke Realty, and are not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. Some of

these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The
analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of
such analyses and of the factors reviewed without considering all analyses and factors could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Furthermore,
mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of
using the data referred to below.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized
and relied upon the Financial Projections. For certain information regarding the Financial Projections, see the

Although Prologis periodically may issue limited financial guidance to investors, Prologis does not as a
matter of course make public long-term projections as to future revenues, net operating income, funds from
operations, funds from operations, as adjusted, or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty
of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Prologis’ management prepared and provided to the
91 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Prologis board in connection with its evaluation of the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, and to its financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, including in connection with its financial
analyses described above under the section entitled “- Opinion of Prologis’ Financial Advisor,” certain
unaudited prospective financial information as set forth below, which we refer to as the “Prologis
management forecasts.” In preparing the Prologis management forecasts, Prologis’ management considered
information communicated by Duke Realty and certain synergies and other changes that Prologis’
management projected to result from the mergers. The below summary of the Prologis management forecasts
is included for the purpose of providing Prologis stockholders access to certain non-public information that
was furnished to the Prologis board, Goldman Sachs and Duke Realty in connection with the mergers and
such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence the voting
decision of any Prologis stockholder or Duke Realty shareholder.
The Prologis management forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, the published
guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for the preparation and presentation of financial
projections. The inclusion of the Prologis management forecasts should not be regarded as an indication
that such information is predictive of actual future events or results and such information should not be
relied upon as such, and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on the Prologis management forecasts. The Prologis management forecasts included in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Prologis’ management.
While presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited prospective financial information set forth below
was based on numerous variables and assumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance
and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Prologis’
business, Duke Realty’s business and the business of the Combined Company on a pro forma basis giving
effect to the mergers, including anticipated or possible synergies) that are inherently subjective and
uncertain and are beyond the control of Prologis’ management. Important factors that may affect actual
results and cause this unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved include, but are not
limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Prologis’ business, Duke Realty’s business and the business of
the Combined Company on a pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers (including its ability to achieve
strategic goals, objectives and targets and to achieve operating synergies over applicable periods), industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other factors described in the sections entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” This unaudited
prospective financial information also reflects numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at
the time they were prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual
results may differ materially from those contained in this unaudited prospective financial information.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Prologis
stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of both Prologis
and Duke Realty for descriptions of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial
condition and capital resources, including in (i) “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in Prologis’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2021 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which are incorporated
by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and (ii) in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Duke Realty’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2021 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, which
are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
None of Prologis, Duke Realty or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other
representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from this unaudited
prospective financial information.

Prologis and Duke Realty may calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including AFFO, Excluding
Gains and Promotes and Unlevered Free Cash Flow using different methodologies. Consequently, the
financial metrics presented in each company’s prospective financial information disclosures and in the
sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the opinions of Prologis’ financial advisor
to Prologis and Duke Realty’s financial advisor to Duke Realty may not be directly comparable to one
another. Further, these financial metrics are “non-GAAP financial measures” as set forth in Item 10(e) of
Regulation S-K and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with
GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures or as an indication of Prologis’, Duke Realty’s or the
Combined Company’s performance. None of these non-GAAP measures represents cash generated from
operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and none are a measure of liquidity or an indicator
of Prologis’, Duke Realty’s or the Combined Company’s ability to make cash distributions. The below
unaudited prospective financial information should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,
financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation
of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial
measures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the below unaudited prospective financial
information ) in connection with a proposed transaction like the mergers when the disclosure is included in a
document like this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial
measures to GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs for purposes of its opinion or
by the Prologis board in connection with its consideration of the mergers. Accordingly, Prologis has not
provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
Prologis has not made and makes no representation to Duke Realty or any Prologis stockholder or Duke
Realty shareholder, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the below unaudited prospective
financial information or regarding the ultimate performance of Prologis, Duke Realty or the Combined
Company on a pro forma basis giving effect to the mergers compared to the unaudited prospective financial
information or that the projected results will be achieved. In light of the foregoing factors and the
uncertainties inherent in the unaudited prospective financial information, Prologis urges all Prologis
stockholders and Duke Realty shareholders not to place undue reliance on such information and to review
Prologis’ most recent SEC filings for a description of Prologis’ reported financial results.
Neither KPMG LLP nor any other registered public accounting firm has compiled, examined or performed any
audit or other procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective financial information contained herein,
nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.
The report of KPMG LLP contained in Prologis’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/​prospectus, relates to the
historical financial information of Prologis. It does not extend to the unaudited prospective financial
information and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial information
does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the dates on which it was prepared.
The Prologis management forecasts were provided to the Prologis board and Prologis’ financial advisor,
Goldman Sachs, and standalone forecasts (other than unlevered free cash flow) were provided to Duke
Realty.

exclude net promote income, real estate related depreciation and amortization expense, net gains or
losses on real estate transactions (e.g., development properties, land, and other investments in real
estate), current income tax expense on dispositions, net unrealized foreign currency and derivative gains
or losses, deferred income tax expense, current income tax expense on dispositions related to acquired
tax liabilities, net gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, straight-lined rents and amortization
of lease intangibles, amortization of debt premium, financing costs, and management contracts (net),

interests and Prologis’ share of unconsolidated ventures.
Based on projected weighted average diluted outstanding shares of stock.
Unlevered Free Cash Flow as used by Prologis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated beginning with
consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and modified to: (i) exclude interest
expense, preferred stock dividends, distributions with respect to Prologis OP preferred units,
depreciation and amortization expense, net gains or losses on real estate transactions (e.g., development
properties, land, and other investments in real estate), net unrealized foreign currency and derivative
gains or losses, deferred income tax expense, net gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt,
straight-lined rents and amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt premium, financing costs,

contemplated by the merger agreement, and to Duke Realty’s financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, for its use

In considering the recommendation of the Duke Realty board to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the company merger, Duke Realty
shareholders should be aware that Duke Realty directors and executive officers have interests in the
company merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Duke Realty shareholders
generally. The Duke Realty board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the company merger), and in
recommending to Duke Realty shareholders that the merger agreement be approved. Such interests are
described below. The company merger will be a “change in control” for purposes of the executive
compensation and benefit plans and agreements described below.
Duke Realty’s executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are
James B. Connor (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), Mark A. Denien (Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer), Steven W. Schnur (Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer), Nicholas C.
Anthony (Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer), and Ann C. Dee (Executive Vice President,
General Counsel and Corporate Secretary). Duke Realty does not have any executive officers who are not
named executive officers.

Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits
described in this section, the following assumptions were used:
The relevant price per share of Duke Realty common stock is $51.75, which is the average closing
price per share of Duke Realty common stock as reported on the NYSE over the first five business
days following the first public announcement of the mergers on June 13, 2022;
The company merger effective time as referenced in this section occurs on July 15, 2022, which is the
assumed date of the company merger effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this
section; and
The employment of each of Duke Realty’s named executive officers was terminated by Prologis
without “cause” or due to the named executive officer’s resignation for “good reason”  (as such terms
are defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the company
merger and on the assumed date of the company merger effective time of July 15, 2022.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect
certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the company merger.
Treatment of Outstanding Duke Realty Equity Awards
Duke Realty RSU Awards
As of the company merger effective time, each Duke Realty RSU award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the company merger effective time will vest in full and will, as of the company merger effective time,
automatically be canceled in exchange for the right of the holder of such award to receive promptly, and in
any event within ten business days, after the company merger effective time a number of shares of Prologis
common stock equal to the product, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, of (i) the number
of shares of Duke Realty common stock subject to such Duke Realty RSU award immediately prior to the
company merger effective time multiplied by (ii) 0.475, less applicable taxes and withholdings.
Duke Realty 2000 PSP Awards
As of the company merger effective time, each Duke Realty 2000 PSP award that is outstanding immediately
prior to the company merger effective time will automatically be canceled in exchange for the right of the
holder of such award to receive promptly, and in any event within ten business days, after the company
merger effective time a number of shares of Prologis common stock equal to the product, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares, of (i) the number of shares of Duke Realty common stock subject to
such Duke Realty 2000 PSP award immediately prior to the company merger effective time multiplied by (ii)
0.475, less applicable taxes and withholdings.
Duke Realty PSP Awards
As of the company merger effective time, each Duke Realty PSP award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the company merger effective time will vest in full and will, as of the company merger effective time,
automatically be canceled in exchange for the right of the holder of such award to receive promptly, and in
any event within ten business days, after the company merger effective time an amount in cash equal to the
Prologis VWAP multiplied by a number of shares of Prologis common stock equal to the product, rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares, of (i) the number of shares of Duke Realty common stock
subject to such Duke Realty PSP award immediately prior to the company merger effective time multiplied by
(ii) 0.475, less applicable taxes and withholdings. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the
number of shares will be determined by deeming the applicable performance conditions to be achieved based
upon (a) in the case of each Duke Realty PSP award granted in calendar years 2021 and 2022, the target level
of achievement and (b) in the case of each Duke Realty PSP award granted in calendar year 2020, the actual
level of achievement of the applicable performance conditions measured in accordance with the terms of the
applicable award certificate.

Duke Realty Director DSU Accounts
As of the company merger effective time, each Duke Realty director DSU account will, as of the company
merger effective time, automatically be canceled in exchange for the right of the holder of such account to
receive promptly, and in any event within ten business days, after the company merger effective time a
number of shares of Prologis common stock equal to the product, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares, of (i) the number of shares of Duke Realty common stock subject to such Duke Realty
director DSU account immediately prior to the company merger effective time multiplied by (ii) 0.475, less
applicable taxes and withholdings. To the extent that any such payments cannot be paid at the time specified

that any such payments cannot be paid at the time specified in the preceding sentence without causing the
imposition of additional taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, such payments will instead be
paid at the earliest time after the company merger effective time that would not result in the imposition of

partnership merger effective time, will, to the extent unvested, vest in full and will, as of the partnership
merger effective time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder of such unit or award,
as applicable, be canceled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive promptly, and in any event within
ten business days, after the partnership merger effective time a number of new Prologis OP common units
equal to (i) the number of vested Duke Realty OP LTIP units held by such holder, the number of Duke Realty
OP LTIP units subject to such Duke Realty OP time-based LTIP unit award, or the number of Duke Realty OP
LTIP units subject to such Duke Realty OP performance-based LTIP unit award, as applicable, as of
immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time, multiplied by (ii) the applicable LTIP Conversion
Factor (as defined in the Duke Realty OP partnership agreement), multiplied by (iii) 0.475, in each case less
applicable taxes and withholdings, and such holder will be admitted as a limited partner of Prologis OP
following the partnership merger effective time in accordance with the terms of the Prologis OP partnership
agreement. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the number of Duke Realty OP LTIP units
subject to each Duke Realty OP performance-based LTIP unit award will be determined by deeming the
applicable performance conditions to be achieved based upon (a) in the case of each Duke Realty OP
performance-based LTIP unit award granted in calendar year 2021 or 2022, the target level of achievement and
(b) in the case of each Duke Realty OP performance-based LTIP unit award granted in calendar year 2020, the
actual level of achievement of the applicable performance conditions measured in accordance with the terms
of the applicable award agreement.
See the section entitled “- Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Duke Realty’s Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” beginning on page 102 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for an estimate of the value of each of Duke Realty’s named executive officer’s
unvested Duke Realty equity awards.
Executive Severance Letter Agreements
Each Duke Realty executive officer is party to an executive severance letter agreement with Duke Realty (the
“Severance Agreements”). Under the terms of each Severance Agreement, in the event that the
100 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
executive’s employment with Duke Realty is terminated within one year following a change in control of
Duke Realty (1) by Duke Realty without “cause” or (2) by the executive for “good reason”  (each term as
defined in the Severance Agreements), then the executive will be entitled to receive separation payments
totaling an amount equal to three times the sum of (i) the executive’s annual base salary then in effect and (ii)
the average annual incentive bonus paid or payable to the executive with respect to services performed in
the three prior calendar years, payable in equal monthly installments over a 24-month period following the
executive’s termination of employment. The company merger will constitute a “change in control” of Duke
Realty for purposes of the Severance Agreements.
In addition, each of Duke Realty’s executive officers will be entitled to receive a healthcare stipend and a
financial advisory stipend during the 24-month severance period. The healthcare stipend is equal to the
difference between (a) the cost the executive would have to pay to continue participation in Duke Realty’s
group medical, dental, vison and/or prescription drug benefits for the executive and his or her eligible
dependents under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”) for a period of
36 months and (b) the active associate rate for such coverage, calculated using the monthly COBRA cost
and active employee rate on the date of the executive’s termination of employment. The healthcare stipend
will be reduced by 50% for months during the severance period in which the executive would be age 65 or
over. The financial advisory stipend is equal to the cost Duke Realty would have to pay to provide the
executive the financial advisory services it provides generally to executive officers for a period of 36 months,
calculated using the annual cost for such services in the year in which the executive’s termination date
occurs.
The Severance Agreements provide that if the payments or benefits that the executive is entitled to under
the Severance Agreement or any other agreement with Duke Realty would, if paid, be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then such payments or benefits will be reduced to the extent
necessary to avoid triggering the excise tax, unless the executive would have a more favorable tax result by
receiving the unreduced payments and paying the excise tax.
The severance payments and stipends described above are conditioned upon the executive’s execution and
non-revocation of a general release of claims. In addition, the executive’s right to receive such severance
payments and stipends would cease if he or she violates any of the post-employment restrictive covenants
in the Severance Agreements, which include non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disclosure
obligations. The non-competition and non-solicitation covenants generally last for two years following the
executive’s termination of employment.
See the section entitled “- Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Duke Realty’s Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” beginning on page 102 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for the estimated severance amounts that each of Duke Realty’s named executive
officers would receive under his or her Severance Agreement upon a qualifying termination of employment
following a change in control of Duke Realty.
Treatment of 2022 Annual Bonuses
Either shortly before, or promptly following, the closing date, each employee of Duke Realty, including each
executive officer, who is eligible to receive a 2022 annual cash incentive payment (a “2022 Bonus”) will
receive payment of such employee’s full 2022 Bonus amount. Each 2022 Bonus amount will be calculated
based on the combination of (i) the actual level of achievement of the applicable pre-established Duke Realty
performance goals through the latest practicable date prior to the closing date, (ii) assuming that the level of
achievement of such pre-established goals for the remainder of 2022 is at the projected level, and (iii)
assuming the target level of performance for any individual performance goals.
See the section entitled “- Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Duke Realty’s Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” beginning on page 102 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for the estimated bonus payment amount that each of Duke Realty’s named executive
officers would receive in connection with the company merger.
280G-Related Further Actions
Prior to the closing date, the Duke Realty board (or the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the
Duke Realty board) is expected to adopt a gross-up plan pursuant to which certain senior executives
101 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
of Duke Realty, including Duke Realty’s named executive officers, will be eligible to receive a “gross-up” in
respect of the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code in relation to the executive’s change in
control payments and benefits relating to the mergers, which would put the executive in the same after-tax
position that the executive would have been in had the excise tax not applied. The maximum aggregate
amount of the gross-up payments that may be payable under such gross-up plan will be $30 million. To the
extent that the aggregate gross-up payments otherwise due under such gross-up plan would exceed such
aggregate cap, each executive’s gross-up payment will be reduced on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate
amount of all gross-up payments does not exceed the aggregate cap.
Termination and Liquidation of Certain Deferred Compensation Plans and Arrangements
Prior to the closing date, the Duke Realty board (or a committee thereof), is expected to terminate, effective
as of the company merger effective time, certain of Duke Realty’s deferred compensation plans and
arrangements, including its Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan, its Executives’ Deferred Compensation
Plan and all outstanding Duke Realty RSU awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation under
Section 409A of the Code. All outstanding deferred compensation amounts under such terminated deferred
compensation plans and arrangements will be paid to the applicable participants within ten business days
following the company merger effective time. Each of Messrs. Schnur and Anthony, and Ms. Dee, have
outstanding, vested deferred Duke Realty RSU awards and/or deferred cash amounts under Duke Realty’s
Executives’ Deferred Compensation Plan. In addition, certain of the current and former non-employee
members of the Duke Realty board have outstanding deferred shares and/or deferred cash amounts under
Duke Realty’s Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan.
Potential Employment Arrangements with Prologis
Any Duke Realty executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to
provide services to Prologis or the surviving entity may, prior to, on or following the company merger
effective time, enter into new individualized compensation arrangements with Prologis or the surviving entity
and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Prologis or the surviving
entity. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, no new individualized compensation
arrangements between Duke Realty’s executive officers and Prologis or the surviving entity have been
established.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Duke Realty non-employee directors and executive officers
will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies following the mergers. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described
in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance”
beginning on page 130 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Duke Realty Chairman and CEO Appointment to Prologis Board
At the company merger effective time, Mr. Connor is expected to be added to the Prologis board to serve,
together with the then members of the Prologis board, until the next annual meeting of shareholders of
Prologis. In connection with such next annual meeting of shareholders of Prologis, the Board Governance
and Nomination Committee of the Prologis board intends to recommend to the Prologis board that it
recommend the nomination of Mr. Connor for re-election to the Prologis board at such annual meeting of
shareholders, provided that at such time Mr. Connor satisfies the qualifications to serve on the Prologis
board.
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Duke Realty’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with
Mergers
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-
K, which requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each of Duke Realty’s named
executive officers that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the mergers. For additional details regarding the
terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption “Interests of Duke
Realty’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” above.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the
footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of
the mergers. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
The relevant price per share of Duke Realty common stock is $51.75, which is the average closing
price per share of Duke Realty common stock as reported on the NYSE over the first five business
days following the first public announcement of the mergers on June 13, 2022;
The company merger effective time as referenced in this section occurs on July 15, 2022, which is the
assumed date of the company merger effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this
section; and
The employment of each of Duke Realty’s named executive officers was terminated by Prologis
without “cause” or due to the named executive officer’s resignation for “good reason”  (as such terms
are defined in the relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the company
merger and on the assumed date of the company merger effective time of July 15, 2022.

Cash. Consists of (a) cash severance equal to (i) three times the sum of (1) the executive’s annual base
salary plus (2) the average annual incentive bonus paid or payable to the executive with respect to the
three calendar years prior to the calendar year in which the executive’s employment terminated, plus (ii)
the payment of certain healthcare and financial advisory stipends, plus (b) the payment of a full bonus
in respect of calendar year 2022. The cash severance payments described in clause (a) are “double
trigger” and become payable only upon a qualifying termination of employment (see “- Interests of
Duke Realty’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers  -  Executive Severance Letter
Agreements”). The annual bonus payments described in clause (b) are “single trigger” and become
payable upon the closing (see “- Interests of Duke Realty’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Mergers  -  Treatment of 2022 Annual Bonuses”). The estimated annual bonus payments set forth in the
table below were calculated based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable pre-established
Duke Realty performance goals measured as of the assumed date of the company merger effective time
of July 15, 2022, and the assumption that the target level of performance was achieved for the applicable
individual performance goals. The estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following

based LTIP unit awards and Duke Realty OP performance-based LTIP unit awards. This accelerated
vesting is a “single-trigger” benefit and becomes payable upon the closing. For further details regarding

As described in the section entitled “- Interests of Duke Realty’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Mergers  -  280G-Related Further Actions”, the Duke Realty board (or the Compensation and Human
Capital Committee of the Duke Realty board) is expected to adopt a gross-up plan pursuant to which
certain senior executives of Duke Realty, including Duke Realty’s named executive officers, will be
eligible to receive a “gross-up” in respect of the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code in
relation to the executive’s change in control payments and benefits relating to the mergers, which would
put the executive in the same after-tax position that the executive would have been in had the excise tax
not applied, up to an aggregate maximum gross-up cap of $30 million. The amounts in this column reflect
the estimated gross-up cost for each named executive officer as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, after application of a pro rata reduction of each executive’s estimated gross-up
amount so that the aggregate gross-up amount does not exceed the $30 million cap. The amounts in this
column do not reflect the impact of certain mitigating actions that are expected to be taken, which could
significantly reduce the gross-up costs.",109,115

preceding the date of the change. Prologis and Duke Realty have not requested and do not intend to request
a ruling from the IRS regarding the federal income tax consequences of the company merger or the Combined
Company’s qualification as a REIT, and the statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are not
binding on the IRS or any court. Thus, Prologis and Duke Realty can provide no assurance that the tax

challenged by the IRS. This summary does not discuss any tax consequences arising under the unearned
income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, any
considerations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the U.S. Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto), any

This summary assumes you hold shares of Duke Realty common stock and, following the company merger,
shares of the Combined Company common stock as “capital assets”  (generally, property held for investment
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code). It does not address all United States federal income tax
consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances. In addition, except where
specifically noted, this discussion does not address the tax consequences relevant to persons subject to
special rules, including, without limitation:
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;
tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;
S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as pass-through entities for
United States federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);

persons that are not United States holders; or
United States persons whose functional currency is not the United States dollar.
When we use the term “United States holder,” we mean a holder of shares of Duke Realty common stock or,
following the company merger, the Combined Company common stock who, for United States federal income
tax purposes, is or is treated as:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust, or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations
to be treated as a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes.
If an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds shares of Duke
Realty common stock or, following the company merger, the Combined Company common stock, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of
the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, any entity treated as a
partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holding shares of Duke Realty common stock or,
following the company merger, the Combined Company common stock and the partners in such partnership

It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that Duke Realty receives a written opinion from Hogan
Lovells US LLP, which we refer to as “Hogan Lovells”  (or other counsel as may be reasonably acceptable to
Duke Realty and Prologis) to the effect that the company merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to the completion of the mergers that Prologis
receives a written opinion from Wachtell Lipton (or other counsel as may be reasonably acceptable to Duke
Realty and Prologis) to the effect that the company merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. Hogan Lovells and Wachtell Lipton are providing opinions to Duke Realty and
Prologis, respectively, to the same effect in connection with the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Such opinions will be subject to customary exceptions, assumptions and
qualifications, and will be based on representations made by Duke Realty and Prologis regarding factual
matters (including those contained in the tax representation letters provided by Duke Realty and Prologis),
and covenants undertaken by Duke Realty and Prologis. If any assumption or representation is inaccurate in
any way, or any covenant is not complied with, the tax consequences of the company merger could differ
from those described in the tax opinions and in this summary. These tax opinions represent the legal
judgment of counsel rendering the opinion and are not binding on the IRS or the courts. If the condition

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Provided the company merger is treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
the United States federal income tax consequences of the company merger will be as follows:
Duke Realty will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the company merger.
A United States holder of shares of Duke Realty common stock will not recognize any gain or loss
upon receipt of the shares of Combined Company common stock in exchange for its shares of Duke
Realty common stock in connection with the company merger, except with respect to cash received in
lieu of any fractional share of the Combined Company common stock, as discussed below.
A United States holder will have an aggregate tax basis in the shares of Combined Company common
stock it receives in the company merger equal to the United States holder’s aggregate tax basis in its
shares of Duke Realty common stock surrendered pursuant to the company merger (including any
fractional shares deemed received and exchange for cash, as discussed below).
The holding period of the shares of Combined Company common stock received by a United States
holder in connection with the company merger will include the holding period of the shares of Duke
Realty common stock surrendered in connection with the company merger.
If a United States holder acquired any of its shares of Duke Realty common stock prior to the
company merger at different prices and/or at different times, U.S. Treasury regulations provide that
the tax basis and holding period of each block of shares of Combined Company common stock
received by such United States holder in the company merger will be determined on a block-for-block
basis depending on the basis and holding period of the blocks of shares of Duke Realty common
stock exchanged for shares of Combined Company common stock. United States holders that
acquired different blocks of shares of Duke Realty common stock at different times or at different
prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of the tax basis and holding period of
such shares of Duke Realty common stock to particular shares of Combined Company common stock
received in the company merger.
Cash received by a United States holder in lieu of a fractional share of the Combined Company
common stock in the company merger will be treated as if such fractional share had been issued in
connection with the company merger and then redeemed by the Combined Company for cash, and
such United States holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss with respect to such cash
payment, measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the United
States holder’s tax basis in such fractional share. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital
gain or loss if, at the company merger effective time, the United States holder’s holding period in
respect of such fractional share (as described above) is greater than one year. Non-corporate United
States stockholders are generally subject to tax on long-term capital gains at reduced rates under
current law. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In general, information reporting requirements will apply to any cash received in the company merger. Certain
holders of shares of Duke Realty common stock may be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of
24%) with respect to any cash received in the company merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply,
however, to a holder of shares of Duke Realty common stock that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification
number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9, or is otherwise exempt
from backup withholding and provides appropriate proof of the applicable exemption. Backup withholding is
not an additional tax and any amounts withheld will be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder’s
United States federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the holder timely furnishes the required
information to the IRS.
Tax Opinions from Counsel Regarding REIT Qualification of Duke Realty and Prologis
It is a condition to the obligation of Prologis to complete the mergers that Prologis receive a written tax
opinion from Alston & Bird LLP (or such other nationally recognized REIT counsel as may be reasonably
acceptable to Prologis and Duke Realty) to the effect that, beginning with its taxable year ended December
31, 1999 and ending at the moment in time immediately prior to the company merger effective time, Duke
Realty has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and

Prologis prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The mergers will be accounted for by
using the business combination accounting rules, which requires the application of a screen test to evaluate
108 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
if substantially all the fair value of the acquired properties is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or
group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset
acquisition or business combination. The primary accounting differences between an asset acquisition and a
business combination are that transaction costs are capitalized in an asset acquisition versus expensed in a
business combination, and that no goodwill is recorded in an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition,
Prologis will measure the real estate assets acquired based on their cost or total consideration exchanged
and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties and
related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. In addition, the rules require the identification of the
acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date, the recognition and measurement, at fair value, of the
identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the consolidated

The merger agreement permits the Duke Realty parties to pay (i) quarterly distributions at a rate not to
exceed $0.28 per share of Duke Realty common stock per quarter (provided that if Prologis increases its
quarterly cash dividend, Duke Realty will be entitled to make a corresponding increase (of not more than

Duke Realty has agreed that the record and payment dates for its quarterly dividends will be set to be the
same dates as those of Prologis. Without limiting the foregoing, the timing of quarterly dividends will be
coordinated by Prologis and Duke Realty so that if either Prologis stockholders or Duke Realty shareholders
receive a dividend for any particular quarter between January 1, 2022 and the partnership merger effective

Stephen Bushansky v. Prologis, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:22-cv-04320 (the “Bushansky Action”), filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in connection with the proposed merger

that Prologis and the Prologis board violated federal securities laws by omitting or misstating material

District Court for the Southern District of New York, in connection with the proposed merger between Duke

Duke Realty and the Duke Realty board violated federal securities laws by omitting or misstating material
information in the Form S-4, rendering the Form S-4 materially deficient. The Plaintiffs in the Bushansky,
Stein and O’Dell Actions seek, among other things, (i) to enjoin the transaction until the alleged deficiencies
in the Form S-4 are corrected, and (ii) attorneys’ and experts’ fees and costs in connection with the lawsuit. If
additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, neither Prologis
nor Duke Realty will necessarily announce such additional filings.
Although the ultimate outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, Prologis and Duke Realty
believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend against these actions vigorously.

This section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus summarizes the material provisions of the merger
agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated
herein by reference. As a Prologis stockholder or a Duke Realty shareholder, you are not a third-party
beneficiary of the merger agreement and therefore, except as expressly provided in the merger agreement,
you may not directly enforce any of its terms and conditions.
This summary may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you.
Duke Realty and Prologis urge you to carefully read the full text of the merger agreement because it is the
legal document that governs the mergers. The merger agreement is not intended to provide you with any
factual information about Duke Realty or Prologis or their respective subsidiaries. In particular, the
assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement (and
summarized below) are qualified by certain information each of Duke Realty and Prologis filed with the
SEC prior to the date of the merger agreement, as well as by certain confidential disclosure schedules each
of the parties delivered to the other in connection with the signing of the merger agreement, that modify,
qualify and create exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the merger agreement.
Moreover, those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date,
may apply contractual standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as
material by investors or that is different from standards of materiality generally applicable under the
United States federal securities laws. Moreover, the representations and warranties are not intended as
statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk among the parties to the merger agreement. The
representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement and the description of such
provisions in this document should not be read alone but instead should be read in conjunction with the
other information contained in the reports, statements and filings that each of Duke Realty and Prologis
file with the SEC and the other information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can
Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference” beginning on page 174.
Duke Realty and Prologis acknowledge that, notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing cautionary
statements, each of them is responsible for considering whether additional specific disclosures of material
information regarding material contractual provisions are required to make the statements in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus not misleading.",122,122

At the company merger effective time, by virtue of the company merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of shares of Duke Realty common stock, Prologis common stock or membership interests in
Prologis Merger Sub, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, (i) all
issued and outstanding membership interests of Prologis Merger Sub immediately prior to the company

parties or any wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Realty and (y) shares of Duke Realty common stock owned
by the Prologis parties or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, which shares of Duke Realty
common stock will be canceled) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, without
interest but subject to any withholding required under applicable tax law. No fractional shares of Prologis
common stock will be issued. In lieu of fractional shares of Prologis common stock, holders of shares of
Duke Realty common stock will receive cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the fractional interest of
Prologis common stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled to receive multiplied by the Prologis
VWAP.
At the partnership merger effective time, by virtue of the partnership merger and without any action on the

time will remain outstanding as the general partnership interests in Duke Realty OP, (iii) each Duke Realty OP
common unit that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time (other

time and (v) each Duke Realty OP common unit owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis Merger
Sub or of Duke Realty OP, in each case, as of immediately prior to the partnership merger effective time, will
be canceled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. No fractional
new Prologis OP common units will be issued in the partnership merger. Any fractional new Prologis OP
common unit that would otherwise be issued to any holder of Duke Realty OP common units will be rounded
up to the nearest whole number and the holders of Duke Realty OP common units will not be entitled to any
further consideration with respect thereto.
Procedures for Surrendering Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
The conversion of shares of Duke Realty common stock into the right to receive the merger consideration,
will occur automatically at the company merger effective time and without any action on the part of any
holder of shares of Duke Realty common stock, shares of Prologis common stock or membership interests in
Prologis Merger Sub. In accordance with the merger agreement, Prologis will appoint Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. as exchange agent to handle the payment and delivery of the merger consideration and the
cash payments to be delivered in lieu of fractional shares. On or before the company merger effective time,
Prologis will deliver to the exchange agent an amount of shares of Prologis common stock in book-entry form
issuable pursuant to the terms of merger agreement equal to the aggregate merger consideration and cash in
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash payments to be delivered in
lieu of fractional shares. Prologis will deposit or cause to be deposited with the exchange agent, as
necessary from time to time following the company merger effective time, any dividends or other
distributions, if any, to which a holder of shares of Duke Realty common stock may be entitled pursuant to
the terms of the merger agreement.
As soon as possible after the company merger effective time, but, in any event, no later than three business
days thereafter, Prologis will cause the exchange agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand)
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates, if any, that immediately prior to the company merger
effective time evidenced outstanding shares of Duke Realty common stock whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, a letter of
transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates to the exchange agent in
exchange for the merger consideration into which the number of shares of Duke Realty common stock
previously evidenced by such certificate or certificates shall have been converted pursuant to the merger
agreement, together with any amounts payable in respect of any fractional shares and dividends or other
distributions on shares of Prologis common stock in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

thereof) to the exchange agent together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal, and
each holder of a book-entry share or book-entry shares that immediately prior to the company merger

such holder (including cash in lieu of any fractional share). Any holder of book-entry share or shares that
immediately prior to the company merger effective time evidenced outstanding shares of Duke Realty
common stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to
the terms of the merger agreement shall not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of

writing by Prologis (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Duke
Realty parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to, and will cause each of Duke Realty’s

respects their present business organizations, ongoing businesses and significant business relationships,
(C) keep available the services of their present officers, and (D) preserve Duke Realty’s status as a REIT
within the meaning of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Duke Realty
parties or any of the Duke Realty subsidiaries will, during the interim period, subject to certain specified

The Prologis parties have agreed to certain restrictions on them during the interim period. In general, except
to the extent required by law, as otherwise expressly required or permitted by the merger agreement or as may
be consented to in writing by Duke Realty (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), the Prologis parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause each
significant subsidiary of Prologis designated in the disclosure schedules, which we refer to as a “Prologis
significant subsidiary,” to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) carry on their respective businesses

assets and properties in their current condition (normal wear and tear excepted), (B) preserve intact in all
material respects their present business organizations, ongoing businesses and significant business
relationships, (C) keep available the services of their present executive officers and (D) preserve Prologis’

liquidation, dissolution or other similar type of transaction in which a third party will acquire beneficial
ownership of more than 15% of the outstanding voting securities of Duke Realty or more than 50% of the
outstanding voting securities of Prologis, or any successor thereto or parent company thereof. The term
“acquisition proposal” does not include the mergers or the other transactions with the parties contemplated
by the merger agreement.
Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth above, the merger agreement provides that each of the Prologis
board and the Duke Realty board will be permitted to take the following actions, prior to the Prologis special
meeting or the Duke Realty special meeting, respectively, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
acquisition proposal by such person or entity made to it after the date of the merger agreement (provided
that the acquisition proposal by a person or entity did not result from a breach by the applicable party or its
subsidiaries or its or their respective representatives of the non-solicitation covenant and covenants
restricting the sharing of information in the merger agreement) and which the Prologis board or the Duke
Realty board, as applicable, concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisors) either constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, if the
Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with their duties
as directors under applicable law: (i) engage in discussions and negotiations regarding such acquisition
proposal with the person or entity who made such acquisition proposal and (ii) provide any non-public
information or data to the person or entity who made such acquisition proposal after entering into a
confidentiality agreement between Prologis or Duke Realty, as applicable, on the one hand, and such person
126 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or entity, on the other hand, having confidentiality and use provisions that are no more favorable as a whole
to such counterparty than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between Duke Realty and
Prologis and which agreement does not prohibit Duke Realty from complying with its obligations under the
merger agreement.
Each of Prologis and Duke Realty will promptly (but in no event later than 36 hours) notify Duke Realty or
Prologis, respectively and as applicable, of the receipt by Prologis, Prologis OP, the Prologis board or any of
their respective representatives, in the case of Prologis, or Duke Realty, Duke Realty OP, the Duke Realty
board or any of their respective representatives, in the case of Duke Realty, of any inquiry, proposal,
indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition
proposal. The notice will be made orally and promptly thereafter in writing, and must indicate the identity of
the person or entity making such inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer, and the material terms and
conditions of, such inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer (including a copy thereof if in writing and
any material documentation or correspondence that sets forth any such terms). Each of Prologis and Duke
Realty must also promptly (but in no event later than 36 hours) notify the other party, as applicable, orally
and promptly thereafter in writing, of any changes or modifications to the material terms of the acquisition
proposal and keep the other party, as applicable, reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
regarding material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning any such acquisition proposal.
Except as described below, neither the Prologis board, the Duke Realty board nor any committee thereof may
(i) withhold or withdraw or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the Duke Realty parties the
recommendation of the Prologis board that the Prologis stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the
Prologis common stock issuance in connection with the company merger, which we refer to as the “Prologis
recommendation,” or to the Prologis parties the recommendation of the Duke Realty board that the Duke
Realty shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, which we refer to as the “Duke
Realty recommendation,”  (ii) adopt, approve or recommend any acquisition proposal (or any transaction or
series of related transactions included within the definition of acquisition proposal), (iii) fail to include the
Prologis recommendation or the Duke Realty recommendation, as applicable, in the joint proxy
statement/prospectus, (iv) fail to recommend against any acquisition proposal subject to Regulation 14D
promulgated under the Exchange Act in any solicitation or recommendation statement made on Schedule
14D-9 within 10 business days after the other party so requests in writing, (v) if an acquisition proposal or
any material modification thereof is made public or is otherwise sent to the holders of shares of Prologis
common stock or Duke Realty common stock, as applicable, fail to issue a press release or other public
communication that reaffirms the Prologis recommendation or the Duke Realty recommendation, as
applicable, within 10 business days after the other party so requests in writing, (vi) authorize, cause or
permit Prologis or Duke Realty, as applicable, or any of its respective affiliates to enter into any acquisition
agreement (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement) or (vii) propose, resolve or agree to take any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(vi) (we refer to any such action set forth above with respect to the Duke Realty recommendation as a
“change in Duke Realty recommendation” and with respect to the Prologis recommendation as a “change in
Prologis recommendation”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to an acquisition proposal, (i) at any time prior to the receipt of
the Prologis stockholder approval, the Prologis board may make a change in Prologis recommendation or (ii)
at any time prior to the receipt of the Duke Realty shareholder approval, the Duke Realty board may make a
change in Duke Realty recommendation or terminate the merger agreement, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii)
(as applicable), if and only if (A) an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal (provided that the
acquisition proposal did not result from a breach by the applicable party or its subsidiaries or its or their
respective representatives of the non-solicitation covenant and covenants restricting the sharing of
information in the merger agreement) is made to Prologis or Duke Realty, as applicable, and is not withdrawn,
(B) the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors) that such acquisition proposal
constitutes a superior proposal (as defined below), (C) the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as
applicable, has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with their duties as directors under applicable
law, (D) four business days, which we refer to as the “notice period,” have elapsed since Prologis or Duke
127 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Realty, as applicable, has given written notice to the other party advising the other party that it intends to
take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the material terms and
conditions of any such superior proposal that is the basis of the proposed action, which we refer to as a
“superior proposal notice,” which superior proposal notice will not, in and of itself, be deemed a change in
Prologis recommendation or a change in Duke Realty recommendation, as applicable, for any purpose of the
merger agreement, (E) during such notice period, Prologis or Duke Realty, as applicable, has considered and,
if requested by the other party, engaged, and caused its representatives to engage, in good faith discussions
with the other party regarding any adjustment or modification of the terms of the merger agreement proposed
by the other party and (F) the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, following such notice
period, again concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of the merger agreement
proposed in writing by the other party) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with their duties as directors under applicable law and that such acquisition proposal continues
to constitute a superior proposal. If during the notice period, any material revisions are made to the superior
proposal (including any change in the purchase price or form of consideration in such superior proposal),
the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, must give notice to the other party regarding
such revisions prior to the expiration of the notice period and the notice period will thereafter expire on the
third business day immediately following the date of the delivery of such notice (but in no event will delivery
of a such notice regarding revisions shorten the four business day duration applicable to the initial notice
period). If the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, does not determine in accordance with
clause (F) above that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal, but thereafter determines to make a
change in Prologis recommendation or a change in Duke Realty recommendation or (with respect to Duke
Realty and the Duke Realty board only) terminate the merger agreement with respect to another acquisition
proposal (whether from the same or different person or entity), the foregoing procedures and requirements
will apply anew prior to the taking of any such actions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, in circumstances not involving or
relating to an acquisition proposal, (i) at any time prior to the receipt of the Prologis stockholder approval,
the Prologis board may make a change in Prologis recommendation or (ii) at any time prior to the receipt of
the Duke Realty shareholder approval, the Duke Realty board may make a change in Duke Realty
recommendation, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), as applicable, if and only if (A) an intervening event
occurs with respect to Prologis or its subsidiaries or with respect to Duke Realty or its subsidiaries,
respectively and as applicable, (B) the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, has concluded
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with their duties as directors under applicable law, (C) four
business days, which we refer to as the “intervening event notice period,” have elapsed since Prologis or
Duke Realty, as applicable, has given written notice (which written notice will not, in and of itself, be deemed
a change in Prologis recommendation or a change in Duke Realty recommendation, as applicable, for any
purpose of the merger agreement) to the other party advising that it intends to take such action and
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, (D) during such intervening event notice period,
Prologis or Duke Realty, as applicable, has considered and, if requested by the other party, engaged and
caused its representatives to engage in good faith discussions with the other party regarding any
adjustment or modification of the terms of the merger agreement proposed by the other party and (E) the
Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, following such intervening event notice period, again
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and
taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of the merger agreement proposed by the
other party) that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with their duties as
directors under applicable law. In the event that the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable,
does not make such a change in Prologis recommendation or a change in Duke Realty recommendation, as
applicable, following such intervening event notice period, but thereafter determines to make such a change
in Prologis recommendation or a change in Duke Realty recommendation, as applicable, in circumstances not
involving an acquisition proposal, the foregoing procedures and requirements will apply anew prior to the
taking of any such actions.
For purposes of the merger agreement and with respect to an acquisition proposal, “superior proposal”
means a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal (except that, for purposes of the definition of
“superior proposal,” the references in the definition of “acquisition proposal” to “15%” are deemed replaced
by “50%”) made by a third party on terms that the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable,
128 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors and taking into
account all factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Prologis board or the Duke Realty
board, as applicable, including, to the extent deemed relevant by the Prologis board or the Duke Realty
board, as applicable, financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the transactions, including the
identity of the person or entity making such proposal, any termination fees, expense reimbursement
provisions, conditions to consummation and whether the transactions contemplated by such acquisition
proposal are reasonably capable of being consummated) would be more favorable to Prologis and the
holders of shares of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty and the holders of shares of Duke Realty
common stock, as applicable, than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. For purposes of
the merger agreement, “intervening event” means a material fact, effect, event, change, development,
circumstance, condition or occurrence that has occurred or arisen after the date of the merger agreement, that
was not known to the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable (or, if known, the consequences
of which were not reasonably foreseeable to the Prologis board or the Duke Realty board, as applicable, as of
the date of the merger agreement) and materially affects the business, assets or operations of Prologis and
its subsidiaries, or of Duke Realty and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable. However, in no event
will any of the following constitute or be taken into account in determining whether an “intervening event”
has occurred: (i) the receipt, terms or existence of any acquisition proposal with respect to the applicable
party (including, with respect to Prologis, any acquisition proposal with respect to more than 15% of the
voting securities or assets of Prologis and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) or any matter relating
thereto, (ii) changes in the market price or trading volume of the shares of beneficial interest or capital stock
of Duke Realty or Prologis or any of their respective subsidiaries, or (iii) Duke Realty or Prologis or any of
their respective subsidiaries meeting, exceeding or failing to meet internal or publicly announced financial
projections, forecasts or predictions (except that with respect to the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), any fact,
effect, event, change, development, circumstance, condition or occurrence giving rise to such change,
meeting, exceedance or failure may otherwise constitute or be taken into account in determining whether an
“intervening event” has occurred if not falling into the foregoing clause (i)).
The merger agreement required each of Prologis and Duke Realty to, and to cause its subsidiaries, and its
and their representatives to, (i) cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any third parties with respect to any acquisition proposal, (ii) terminate any such third
party’s access to any physical or electronic data rooms and (iii) request that any such third party and its
representatives destroy or return all confidential information concerning such party or its subsidiaries
furnished by or on behalf of such party or any of its subsidiaries and destroy all analyses and other
materials prepared by or on behalf of such person or entity that contain, reflect or analyze such confidential
information, in the case of the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), to the extent required by and in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement between such party or any of its subsidiaries and
such person or entity. Each of Prologis and Duke Realty agreed to promptly inform its and its subsidiaries’
respective representatives of the obligations set forth above.
Unless the merger agreement is terminated, (i) notwithstanding a change in Duke Realty recommendation,
unless Duke Realty terminates the merger agreement in connection with a superior proposal, Duke Realty
must cause the approval of the merger agreement to be submitted to a vote of its shareholders at the Duke
Realty special meeting and (ii) notwithstanding a change in Prologis recommendation, Prologis must cause
the approval of the Prologis common stock issuance to be submitted to a vote of its stockholders at the
Prologis special meeting.
Neither Prologis nor Duke Realty may submit to the vote of its stockholders or shareholders, respectively,
any acquisition proposal other than the mergers prior to the termination of the merger agreement. In addition,
except as part of a change in Prologis recommendation permitted by the merger agreement, prior to the
termination of the merger agreement, neither Prologis nor any of its subsidiaries may file a proxy statement
(including in preliminary form) with respect to, or publicly announce the entry into a definitive agreement
providing for, an acquisition proposal with respect to Prologis (including any acquisition proposal with
respect to more than 15% of the voting securities or assets of Prologis and its subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis) if such acquisition proposal would require a vote of Prologis’ stockholders in connection with such
acquisition proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Form S-4, Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Prologis Special Meeting
The merger agreement provides that, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of the merger
agreement, each of the parties to the merger agreement is required to jointly prepare and cause to be filed
with the SEC the joint proxy statement included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and a registration
statement on Form S-4 with respect to the Prologis common stock issuable in the company merger. In
addition, Prologis must prepare and cause to be submitted to the NYSE the application and other agreements
and documentation necessary for the listing of the Prologis common stock issuable in the company merger
on the NYSE. Prologis must also use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have the application for the
listing of the Prologis common stock accepted by the NYSE as promptly as is practicable following
submission.
The Prologis parties have the right, to the extent necessary (and following consultation with Duke Realty), to
prepare and file a Form S-4 or any other registration form under the Securities Act or Exchange Act with
respect to the new Prologis OP common units, which we refer to as the “OP unit Form S-4,” to be issued in
connection with the partnership merger. The Duke Realty parties will cooperate in the preparation of the OP
unit Form S-4. In the event the Prologis parties determine to prepare and file the OP unit Form S-4, the
Prologis parties will prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
such determination, the OP unit Form S-4.
Each of Prologis and Duke Realty must cause this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be mailed to its
stockholders and shareholders, respectively, entitled to vote at the Prologis special meeting or the Duke
Realty special meeting, respectively, and to hold the Prologis special meeting or the Duke Realty special
meeting, respectively, as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective. Each of Prologis and
Duke Realty must also include in this joint proxy statement/prospectus the Prologis recommendation and the
Duke Realty recommendation, respectively, and must use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Prologis
stockholder approval and the Duke Realty shareholder approval, respectively, unless a change in Prologis
recommendation or a change in Duke Realty recommendation, respectively, has occurred pursuant to the
merger agreement.
Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
From and after the company merger effective time, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and subject
to certain limitations, Prologis is required to (or to cause Prologis OP to), for a period of six years from the
company merger effective time, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date of the merger
agreement, was previously, or is during the interim period, serving as, among others, manager, director,
officer, trustee or fiduciary of Duke Realty or any of its subsidiaries, in connection with any claim with
respect to matters occurring on or before the company merger effective time and any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, claim expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) relating to or resulting from such claim, to the fullest extent that an Indiana corporation is permitted
to indemnify and hold harmless its own such persons or entities under the applicable laws of the State of
Indiana, as in effect on the date of the merger agreement or thereafter in effect. Prologis is also required to
promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the indemnified parties, to the fullest extent that an Indiana
corporation is permitted to indemnify and hold harmless its own such persons or entities under the
applicable laws of the State of Indiana, as now or hereafter in effect, any claim expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any claim in
advance of the final disposition of such claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the
indemnified party of any claim expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with enforcing
any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but subject to Prologis’ receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
indemnified party to repay such claim expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable laws or any of
the Duke Realty governing documents that such indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified.
Prior to the company merger effective time, Duke Realty is required to obtain and fully pay the premium for,
and Prologis is required to maintain in full force and effect (and the obligations thereunder to be honored),
during the six-year period beginning on the date of the company merger, a “tail” prepaid directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy or policies (which policy or policies by their respective express terms shall
survive the mergers) from Duke Realty’s current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the same
130 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or better credit rating as Duke Realty’s current insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage and amounts
and containing terms and conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than Duke
Realty’s and its subsidiaries’ existing directors’ and officers’ liability policy or policies for the benefit of the
indemnified parties with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or prior to the company merger effective time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in no event will the aggregate premium for such “tail” insurance policy
exceed 250% of the current annual premium paid by Duke Realty for such insurance, and (ii) if the aggregate
premium exceeds 250%, Duke Realty will be entitled to obtain comparable “tail” insurance as reasonably
available for an aggregate cost equal to 250% of the current annual premium.
Efforts to Complete Transactions; Consents
Each of the Duke Realty parties and the Prologis parties has agreed to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the mergers and to cooperate with
each other in connection with the foregoing, including the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain
any necessary or as reasonably determined by Prologis and Duke Realty advisable consents, approvals,
orders, exemptions, waivers and authorizations by or from (or to give any notice to) any public or private
third party, including any that are required to be obtained or made under any law or any contract, agreement
or instrument to which Duke Realty or any Duke Realty subsidiary or Prologis, Prologis OP or any Prologis
subsidiary, as applicable, is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, to
defend all lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the
mergers, to effect all necessary registrations and other filings and submissions of information requested by a
governmental authority, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be lifted or rescinded any
injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
mergers.
Access to Information; Confidentiality
During the interim period, to the extent permitted by applicable law and contracts, each of the Duke Realty
parties and the Prologis parties shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, furnish Prologis or Duke
Realty, as applicable, with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
business, properties, offices, books, contracts, records and personnel of Duke Realty and its subsidiaries or
Prologis, Prologis OP and the Prologis subsidiaries, as applicable, as Prologis or Duke Realty, as applicable,
may from time to time reasonably request, and, with respect to Duke Realty and its subsidiaries and subject
to the terms of the Duke Realty leases, facilitate reasonable access for Prologis and its authorized
representatives during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to all Duke Realty real
properties.
Prior to the company merger effective time, each of Duke Realty and Prologis will hold, and will cause its
respective representatives and affiliates to hold, any non-public information in confidence to the extent
required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the existing confidentiality
agreement by and between Prologis and Duke Realty, which will remain in full force and effect pursuant to
the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and delivery of the merger agreement or the termination
thereof.
Public Announcements
So long as the merger agreement is in effect, each of Duke Realty and Prologis must, subject to certain
exceptions, consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements or filings with respect to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. In addition, neither of Duke Realty nor Prologis may issue any such press release or make
any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the consent of the other party (which consent may not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), subject to certain agreed exceptions.
131 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation
Duke Realty and Prologis must provide prompt notice to the other of any notice or other communication
received from any governmental authority in connection with the merger agreement, any of the mergers or
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or from any person or entity alleging that its
consent is or may be required in connection with any of the mergers or the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.
Promptly after becoming aware, each of Duke Realty and Prologis must give written notice to the other if any
representation or warranty made by such party in the merger agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such
that, if uncured, it would reasonably be expected to result in any of the applicable closing conditions not
being capable of being satisfied prior to the outside closing date, or if such party fails to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement contained in the merger agreement such
that, if uncured, it would result in any of the applicable closing conditions not being satisfied.
Each of Duke Realty and Prologis must give prompt notice to the other if, to Duke Realty’s knowledge or
Prologis’ knowledge, as applicable, the occurrence of any state of facts or effect, event, change,
development, circumstance, condition or occurrence would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause,
any of the conditions to closing not being satisfied or satisfaction thereof to be reasonably delayed.
Each of Duke Realty and Prologis must give prompt written notice to the other upon becoming aware of the
occurrence or impending occurrence of any effect, event, change, development, circumstance, condition or
occurrence relating to it or any of its subsidiaries, which could reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a company material adverse effect or parent material adverse effect, as applicable.
Each of Duke Realty and Prologis must give prompt notice to the other of any claim, action, suit, litigation,
proceeding, arbitration, mediation or other investigation or audit commenced or, to Duke Realty’s knowledge
or Prologis’ knowledge, as applicable, threatened against, relating to or involving such party or any of its
subsidiaries that relates to the merger agreement, the mergers or the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and each party must keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any such matters.
Each party has agreed to allow the other the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any litigation against the other party, its directors or its officers relating to the merger
agreement, the mergers and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and Duke Realty may
not agree to a settlement of any such litigation without Prologis’ consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed in the case of any such settlement that only requires payment of monetary amounts
by Duke Realty).
Pre-Closing Transactions
In addition, the merger agreement requires that Duke Realty use commercially reasonable efforts during the
interim period to provide such cooperation and assistance as Prologis may reasonably request to (i) identify
certain assets that Prologis may desire to be purchased by one or more Prologis subsidiaries or affiliates of
the Prologis parties from one or more Duke Realty subsidiaries as part of one or more “like-kind exchanges”
under Section 1031 of the Code by such Prologis subsidiaries, (ii) identify certain assets that Prologis may
desire to be purchased by one or more Duke Realty subsidiaries from one or more Prologis subsidiaries or
the affiliates of the Prologis parties as part of one or more “like-kind exchanges” under Section 1031 of the
Code by such Duke Realty subsidiaries, (iii) cause such purchases or sales referred to in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) to be completed pursuant to such terms as may be designated by Prologis and as may be
necessary for such purchases or sales to constitute part of one or more like-kind exchanges under Section
1031 of the Code, (iv) convert or cause the conversion of any of Duke Realty’s wholly owned subsidiaries
organized as a corporation or limited partnership into a limited liability company on the basis of
organizational documents as reasonably requested by Prologis, (v) sell or cause to be sold stock, partnership
interests or limited liability interests owned, directly or indirectly, by Duke Realty in one or more Duke Realty
subsidiaries at a price and on terms designated by Prologis, (vi) exercise any of Duke Realty’s or its
subsidiaries’ rights to terminate or cause to be terminated any contract to which Duke Realty or a Duke

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Realty subsidiary is a party and (vii) sell or cause to be sold any of the assets and properties of Duke Realty
or one or more of its subsidiaries at a price and on terms designated by Prologis.
These rights of Prologis are limited, however, in that (i) Prologis may not require Duke Realty or any of its
subsidiaries to take any action that contravenes any of Duke Realty’s or any of its subsidiaries’
organizational documents, material contracts or applicable law, (ii) any such conversions, effective times of
terminations, sales or transactions (A) must be contingent upon all conditions to the mergers under the
merger agreement having been satisfied or waived and Duke Realty’s receipt of a written notice from Prologis
to such effect and that the Prologis parties are prepared to proceed immediately with the closing of the
mergers and (B) with respect to the transactions described in clauses (v), (vi) and (vii) of the previous
paragraph, must not occur prior to the closing, (iii) these actions (or the inability to complete them) will not
affect or modify the obligations of the Prologis parties under the merger agreement, including the amount of
or timing of the payment of the merger consideration, the fractional share consideration and the partnership
merger consideration, (iv) Duke Realty and its subsidiaries will not be required to take any action that could
adversely affect Duke Realty’s classification, or the classification of any of Duke Realty’s subsidiaries that is
classified as a REIT, as a REIT or that could subject Duke Realty or any such subsidiary to any “prohibited
transactions” taxes or certain other material taxes under the Code (or other material entry-level taxes), (v)
Duke Realty and its subsidiaries will not be required to take any such action that could result in any United
States federal, state or local income tax being imposed on, or adverse tax consequences to, any holder of
Duke Realty OP common units other than Duke Realty or any of its subsidiaries or any equity holders in
Duke Realty (in such person’s capacity as an equity holder) and (vi) neither Duke Realty nor any of the Duke
Realty subsidiaries will be required to (A) enter into any contract, or make any undertaking, that would not
by its terms terminate upon a termination of the merger agreement, with no continuing obligation or liability
for Duke Realty or any Duke Realty subsidiary, (B) consent to, or enter into any contract providing for, the
consummation of any sale or other disposition of any assets or properties prior to the closing date, or (C)
pay any fee or incur any liability, other than reasonable out-of-pocket-expenses or reasonable security
deposits that are advanced or promptly reimbursed by the Prologis parties in accordance with the merger
agreement. Prologis will, promptly upon Duke Realty’s request, reimburse Duke Realty for all reasonable out-
of-pocket costs incurred by Duke Realty or its subsidiaries in connection with Duke Realty’s or its
subsidiaries’ performance of these obligations.
Financing Cooperation
During the interim period, Duke Realty is required to, and is required to cause its subsidiaries to, and is
required to cause its and their representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Prologis
in connection with financing arrangements as Prologis may reasonably determine is necessary or advisable
in connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Prologis may
undertake offers to purchase, offers to exchange and/or consent solicitations in respect of Duke Realty’s
outstanding notes, with which Duke Realty has agreed to cooperate.
Other Covenants and Agreements
The merger agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including covenants related to:
each of Duke Realty and Prologis using its respective reasonable best efforts to cause the company
merger to qualify as a reorganization under the Code;
Duke Realty cooperating and consulting in good faith with Prologis with respect to maintenance of
Duke Realty’s REIT status (and that of any of Duke Realty’s subsidiaries that is a REIT) for Duke
Realty’s 2022 taxable year, and both parties cooperating to cause each Taxable REIT Subsidiary of
Duke Realty to jointly elect with Prologis to be treated as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of Prologis,
effective as of the date of the company merger effective time;
each of Duke Realty and Prologis taking all steps to cause any disposition of shares of Duke Realty

and approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter
unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is
set forth in the corporation’s charter. Under the MGCL, the term “substantially all of the company’s assets”
is not defined and is, therefore, subject to Maryland common law and to judicial interpretation and review in
the context of the unique facts and circumstances of any particular transaction. Prologis’ charter does not
provide for a lesser percentage in any of the above situations.
Liquidation Preference
Under the MGCL, stockholders are generally not liable for Prologis’ debts or obligations. If Prologis
liquidates, subject to the right of any holders of its preferred stock to receive preferential distributions, each
outstanding share of Prologis common stock will be entitled to participate pro rata in the assets remaining
after payment of, or adequate provision for, all of its known debts and liabilities, including debts and
liabilities arising out of Prologis’ status as general partner of Prologis OP.
Subject to the provisions of Prologis’ charter regarding the ownership of shares of common stock in excess
of the ownership limit, or such other limit specified in its charter, or as otherwise permitted by the Prologis
board as described below, all shares of common stock have equal distribution, liquidation and voting rights,
and have no preference or exchange rights.
Conversion & Sinking Fund
Holders of shares of Prologis common stock do not have any conversion, exchange, sinking fund, or
redemption rights.
Listing
The common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “PLD.” Following completion of the company
merger, the shares of common stock of the Combined Company will continue to be traded on the NYSE under
the symbol “PLD.”
Classification of Common Stock
Prologis’ charter authorizes the Prologis board to reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock into other
classes or series of classes of stock and to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to set
the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations and restrictions on
ownership, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of
redemption for each class or series.
Transfer Agent
All shares of Prologis common stock that are issued and outstanding are duly authorized, fully paid and
nonassessable. The transfer agent, registrar and dividend disbursing agent for Prologis common stock is
currently Computershare Trust Company, N.A.",159,160

In order for Prologis to qualify as a REIT under the Code, no more than 50% in value of all classes of its
outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as
defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first year
for which Prologis has made an election to be treated as a REIT). In addition, if Prologis, or an owner of 10%
or more of its capital stock, actually or constructively own 10% or more of one of its tenants (or a tenant of
any partnership or limited liability company in which Prologis is a partner or member), the rent received by
Prologis (either directly or through the partnership or limited liability company) from the tenant will not be
qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests for REITs contained in the Code. A REIT’s stock
also must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a
149 • 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for
which an election to be treated as a REIT has been made).
Because the Prologis board believes it is desirable for Prologis to qualify as a REIT, its charter, subject to
certain exceptions as discussed below, provides that no person may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of
the constructive ownership provisions of the Code, (i) more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of its issued and outstanding common stock or (ii) series Q preferred stock,
that, together with all other capital stock owned or deemed owned by such person, would cause such person
to own or be deemed to own more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of
its issued and outstanding capital stock. Further, subject to certain exceptions, no person, or persons acting
as a group, shall at any time directly or indirectly acquire ownership of more than 25% of the series Q
preferred stock. With respect to the 9.8% ownership limit, the constructive ownership rules under the Code
are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and/or
entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8%
of Prologis common stock, any series of outstanding preferred stock or any other capital stock (or the
acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, common stock, any series of
outstanding preferred stock or any other capital stock) by an individual or entity could nevertheless cause
that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of its
outstanding common stock or any other capital stock, as the case may be, and thereby subject the common
stock, any series of outstanding preferred stock or any other capital stock to the applicable ownership limit.
The Prologis board may, but in no event will be required to, waive the 9.8% and 25% ownership limits, as
applicable, with respect to a particular stockholder if it determines that such ownership will not jeopardize
Prologis’ status as a REIT and the Prologis board otherwise decides such action would be in its best interest.
As a condition of such waiver, the Prologis board may require an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it and/or
undertakings or representations from the applicant with respect to preserving Prologis’ REIT status.
Prologis’ charter also provides that:
no person may actually or constructively own common stock or series Q preferred stock that would
result in Prologis being “closely held” under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause Prologis
to fail to qualify as a REIT;
no person may transfer common stock or series Q preferred stock if a transfer would result in shares
of Prologis’ capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons; and
any person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire actual or constructive ownership of
common stock or series Q preferred stock that will or may violate any of the foregoing restrictions on
transferability and ownership is required to notify Prologis immediately and provide Prologis with
such other information as Prologis may request in order to determine the effect of the transfer on
Prologis’ status as a REIT.
These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if the Prologis board determines that it is
no longer in Prologis’ best interest to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT and such
determination is approved by the affirmative vote of holders owning at least two-thirds of the shares of
Prologis’ outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon. Except as otherwise described above, any
change in the applicable ownership limit would require an amendment to Prologis’ charter, which must be
declared advisable by the Prologis board and approved by the affirmative vote of holders owning at least
two-thirds of the shares of Prologis’ outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the amendment.
Under Prologis’ charter, if any attempted transfer of shares of stock or any other event would otherwise
result in any person violating an ownership limit, any other limit imposed by the Prologis board or the other
restrictions in the charter, then any such attempted transfer will be void and of no force or effect with respect
to the purported transferee as to that number of shares that exceeds the applicable ownership limit or such
other limit or restriction, which we refer to as “excess shares.” Under those circumstances, the prohibited
transferee will acquire no right or interest (or, in the case of any event other than an attempted transfer, the
person or entity holding record title to any shares in excess of the applicable ownership limit will cease to
own any right or interest) in the excess shares. Any excess shares described above will be transferred
automatically, by operation of law, to a trust, the beneficiary of which will be a qualified charitable
150 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
organization selected by Prologis. This automatic transfer will be considered to be effective as of the close of
business on the business day prior to the date of the violating transfer or event. Within 20 days of receiving
notice from Prologis of the transfer of shares to such trust, the trustee of such trust will be required to sell
the excess shares to a person or entity who could own the shares without violating the applicable ownership
limit, or any other limit imposed by the Prologis board, and distribute to the prohibited transferee an amount
equal to the lesser of the price paid by the prohibited transferee for the excess shares or the sales proceeds
received by such trust for the excess shares. In the case of any excess shares resulting from any event other
than a transfer, or from a transfer for no consideration (such as a gift), the trustee will be required to sell the
excess shares to a qualified person or entity and distribute to the prohibited owner an amount equal to the
lesser of the applicable market price of the excess shares as of the date of the event or the sales proceeds
received by such trust for the excess shares. In either case, any proceeds in excess of the amount
distributable to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner will be distributed to the beneficiary. Prior to a
sale of any excess shares by such trust, the trustee will be entitled to receive, in trust for the beneficiary, all
dividends and other distributions paid by Prologis with respect to the excess shares, and also will be entitled
to exercise all voting rights with respect to the excess shares. Subject to Maryland law, effective as of the
date that the shares have been transferred to such trust, the trustee will have the authority (at the trustee’s
sole discretion) to rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited transferee or prohibited owner prior to the
time that Prologis discovers that the shares have been automatically transferred to such trust and to recast
the vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary. However, if
Prologis has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee will not have the authority to
rescind and recast the vote. If Prologis pays the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner any dividend or
other distribution before it discovers that the shares were transferred to such trust, the prohibited transferee
or prohibited owner will be required to repay the trustee upon demand for distribution to the beneficiary. If
the transfer to such trust is not automatically effective (for any reason), to prevent violation of the
applicable ownership limit or any other limit provided in Prologis’ charter or imposed by the Prologis board,
then Prologis’ charter provides that the transfer of the excess shares will be void ab initio and the intended
transferee will acquire no rights to such shares.
In addition, shares of stock held in such trust will be considered to have been offered for sale to Prologis, or
its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted
in the transfer to such trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the market price at the time of such devise or
gift), and (ii) the applicable market price on the date that Prologis, or its designee, accept the offer. Prologis
has the right to accept the offer until the trustee has sold the shares held in such trust. Upon that sale to
Prologis, the interest of the beneficiary in the shares sold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net
proceeds of the sale to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner.
If any attempted transfer of shares would cause Prologis to be beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons,
its charter provides that the transfer will be void ab initio and the intended transferee will acquire no rights
to such shares.
All certificates representing shares will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above.
Under Prologis’ charter, owners of its issued and outstanding common stock must, upon its demand, provide
Prologis with a completed questionnaire containing information regarding ownership of the shares, as set
forth in the U.S. Treasury regulations, and must upon demand disclose to Prologis in writing such
information that Prologis may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of the stockholder’s actual and
constructive ownership of shares of its stock, on its status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with each
ownership limit, or any other limit specified in its charter or required by the Prologis board. In addition,
owners of any series of outstanding preferred stock (currently only series Q preferred stock is outstanding)
must provide to Prologis information that it requests, in good faith, in order to determine its status as a REIT.",160,162

Certain provisions of the Prologis charter could make it less likely that the Prologis board or management
would be changed or someone would acquire voting control of Prologis without the consent of the Prologis
board. These provisions could delay, deter or prevent tender offers or takeover attempts that
151 • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Prologis stockholders might believe are in their best interests, including tender offers or takeover attempts
that could allow Prologis stockholders to receive premiums over the market price of their common stock.
Preferred Stock
At any time, without stockholder approval, the Prologis board can issue one or more new series of preferred
stock. In some cases, the issuance of preferred stock could discourage or make more difficult attempts to
take control of Prologis through a merger, tender offer, proxy context or otherwise. Preferred stock with
special voting rights or other features issued to persons favoring Prologis management could stop a
takeover by preventing the person trying to take control of Prologis from acquiring enough voting shares to
take control.
Stockholders’ Rights Plan
Although Prologis does not have a stockholders’ rights plan as of the date of this document, under
Maryland law, the Prologis board can adopt a rights plan without stockholder approval. If adopted, a rights
plan could operate to cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Prologis on
terms not approved by the Prologis board.
Extraordinary Actions
Currently, the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be
cast on the matter is required to amend the Prologis charter or approve certain other extraordinary actions,
such as mergers, which could discourage or make more difficult attempts to take control of Prologis through
a merger, tender offer, proxy context or otherwise.
Opt Out of Business Combinations and Control Share Acquisition Statutes
Prologis has elected in its bylaws not to be governed by the “control share acquisition” provisions of the
MGCL (Sections 3-701 through 3-709), and the Prologis board has determined, by irrevocable resolution, that
Prologis will not be governed by the “business combination” provision of the MGCL (Section 3-602).
Prologis’ bylaws provide that Prologis cannot at a future date determine to be governed by either provision
without the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote. In addition,
the irrevocable resolution adopted by the Prologis board may only be changed by the approval of a majority
of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote.
Certain Elective Provisions of Maryland Law
Any Maryland corporation that has a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three
independent directors may elect to be governed in whole or in part by Maryland law provisions relating to
extraordinary actions and unsolicited takeovers. Prologis has not elected to be governed by these specific
provisions, but Prologis currently has more than three independent directors, so, except as described below,
the Prologis board could elect to provide for any of the following provisions. Pursuant to these provisions,
the board of directors of any Maryland corporation fitting such description, without obtaining stockholder
approval and notwithstanding a contrary provision in its charter or bylaws, may elect to:
classify the board;
increase the required stockholder vote to remove a director to two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be
cast by the stockholders generally in the election of directors; and/or
require that a stockholder-requested special meeting need be called only upon the written request of
the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.
Additionally, the board could provide that:
the number of directors may be fixed only by a vote of the board of directors;
each vacancy on the board of directors (including a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director
by the stockholders) may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors
in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum; and/or
152 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any director elected to fill a vacancy will hold office for the full remainder of the term of the class of
directors in which the vacancy occurred, rather than until the next election of directors.
These provisions do not provide for limits on the power of a corporation to confer on the holders of any
class or series of preferred stock the right to elect one or more directors. In addition, a corporation’s charter
may contain a provision or the board of directors of the corporation may adopt a resolution that prohibits
the corporation from electing to be subject to any or all of these provisions. The Prologis board adopted a
resolution prohibiting Prologis from electing to be subject to the classified board provision in Section 3-803
of the MGCL. This resolution is irrevocable without the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of
common stock entitled to vote.
Although Prologis has opted out of the classified board and is not currently governed by any of the
remaining provisions, Prologis’ charter and/or bylaws already provide for a two-thirds vote to remove
directors and only for cause, and provide that the number of directors may be determined by a resolution of
the Prologis board (or by Prologis’ stockholders through a bylaw amendment), subject to a minimum and
maximum number, and that Prologis’ secretary must call a special meeting of stockholders only upon the
written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least 50% of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.
Amendment to Prologis’ Charter and Bylaws
Other than certain amendments permitted to be made without stockholder approval under Maryland law,
Prologis’ charter may not be amended without the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the shares of
capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the amendment, voting together as a single class.
Except as described in the following paragraph, Prologis’ bylaws may be amended by the vote of a majority
of the Prologis board or by a vote of a majority of the shares of Prologis’ capital stock entitled to vote on the
amendment, except with respect to the following bylaw provisions (each of which requires the approval of a
majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote on the amendment):
provisions opting out of the control share acquisition statute;
provisions confirming that the Prologis board has determined by irrevocable resolution that Prologis
will not be governed by the business combination provisions of the MGCL;
the requirement in Prologis’ bylaws that its independent directors approve transactions involving
Prologis’ executive officers or directors or any limited partners of Prologis OP and their affiliates;
provisions governing amendment of Prologis’ bylaws; and
provisions requiring written notice of stockholder meetings.

Voting Rights

consummated without the approval
of its stockholders.
Each outstanding share of Prologis
common stock entitles the holder
thereof to one vote on all matters
submitted to a vote of Prologis
stockholders, including the election
of directors, and the Prologis charter
permits the Prologis board to
classify and authorize the issuance,
from time to time, of preferred stock
in one or more series or classes
having voting power which may
differ from that of the common stock.

Classified Board / Term of
Directors
The Prologis board is not classified.
The directors of Prologis hold office
for a term expiring at the next
succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders and until their
successors are duly elected and
qualify. In the event of an increase or
decrease in the size of the Prologis
board, each incumbent director will

Removal of Directors
Directors may be removed only for
cause and only by the affirmative
vote of stockholders entitled to cast
two-thirds of the votes entitled to be
cast in the election of directors,
subject to the rights of holders of
Prologis preferred stock to elect and
remove directors elected by such
holders under certain circumstances.
Directors may be removed for
cause by the affirmative vote of
at least a majority of the total
votes eligible to be cast by
shareholders at a duly
constituted meeting of
shareholders called expressly for
such purpose.
Election of Directors
Prologis’ bylaws provide that, in the
case of a non-contested election,
directors must receive a majority of
votes cast for election at a meeting
at which a quorum is present. For
this purpose, a majority of the votes
cast means that the number of votes
that are cast “for” the election of a
director must exceed the number of
votes that are withheld from or cast
against his or her election. Under
Prologis’ bylaws, any incumbent
director who is not re-elected but
would nevertheless for any reason
otherwise remain in office is required
to promptly tender his or her
resignation to the Prologis board for
its consideration. The Prologis board
will act on any such tendered
Duke Realty’s charter provides
that, election of each director at

determination is made that the
number of director nominees is
expected to exceed the number of
directors to be elected at a meeting),
directors will be elected by a
plurality of the votes cast.
Filling Vacancies of Directors
Any vacancies on the Prologis board
are filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the remaining directors,
although less than a quorum,
provided that (i) a vacancy caused
by an increase in the number of
directors may be filled only by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the
entire Prologis board and (ii) a
vacancy caused by the removal of a
director may be filled by the
remaining directors, subject to
approval by the stockholders
entitled to elect the director who was
removed at the next annual meeting
of stockholders or at a special
meeting of stockholders called for
such purpose.
A director elected to fill a vacancy
will serve for the remainder of the
term.

Ownership Limitations
In addition to certain other
ownership limitations relating to
capital stock set forth in Prologis’
charter, and with certain limited
exceptions, no person may
beneficially own, or be deemed to
own by virtue of the attribution
provisions of the Code, (i) more than
9.8% (by value or number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of
Prologis’ issued and outstanding
common stock or (ii) Prologis’ series
Q preferred stock, that, together with
all other capital stock owned or
deemed owned by such person,
would cause such person to own or
be deemed to own more than 9.8%
(by value or number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of
Prologis’ issued and outstanding
capital stock. Further, subject to
certain exceptions, no person, or
persons acting as a group, may at
any time directly or indirectly acquire
ownership of more than 25% of
Prologis’ series Q preferred stock.
These limits may be waived by the

not jeopardize Prologis’ status as a
REIT and the Prologis board
otherwise decides such action would
be in Prologis’ best interest.
In addition to certain other
ownership limitations relating to
capital stock set forth in Duke
Realty’s charter, and with certain
limited exceptions, no person
may own, directly or
constructively (including upon

Duke Realty securities owned
directly or constructively by
such person) (i) more than 9.8%
(in value or number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of
Duke Realty’s outstanding
common stock, or (ii) more than
9.8% in value of the aggregate of
Duke Realty’s outstanding
capital stock. These limits may
be waived by the Duke Realty
board with respect to a
particular shareholder if the
board determines that such
ownership will not jeopardize
Duke Realty’s status as a REIT
nor result in violation of Duke
Realty’s other ownership limits.

State of Anti-Takeover Statutes
Maryland law provides that holders
of “control shares” of a Maryland
corporation acquired in a “control
share acquisition” have no voting
rights with respect to the control
shares except to the extent approved
by a vote of two-thirds of the votes
entitled to be cast on the matter,
excluding shares of stock owned by
the acquirer, by officers of the
corporation or by employees who are
also directors of the corporation.
“Control shares” are shares of stock
Indiana law provides that
anyone making a tender offer of
more than 10% of any class of
the outstanding equity
securities of an Indiana
corporation must file a statement
(generally consisting of each
document required to be filed
with the SEC) with the Indiana
securities commissioner and the
president of the target company
before the offer is made and that
the offer be made to all offerees

of the corporation that, if aggregated
with other shares controlled by the
acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to
exercise voting power in electing
directors within one of the following
ranges of voting power: one-tenth or
more but less than one-third, one-
third or more but less than a majority,
or a majority or more of all voting
power. Control shares do not include
shares the acquiring person is then
entitled to vote as a result of having
previously obtained stockholder
approval. Generally, a “control share
acquisition” means the acquisition of
outstanding control shares. A
control share acquisition does not
include shares acquired in a merger,
consolidation or share exchange if
the corporation is a party to the
transaction or to acquisitions
approved or exempted by the charter
or bylaws of the corporation. As
permitted under Maryland law,
Prologis has elected not to be
governed by the provisions of the
control share acquisition statute.
Under Maryland law, certain
“business combinations”  (which
include a merger, consolidation,
share exchange and certain transfers,
issuances or reclassifications of
equity securities) between a
Maryland corporation and any
person who beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, 10% or more of
the voting power of the
corporation’s outstanding voting
stock, or an affiliate or associate of
the corporation who beneficially
owned, directly or indirectly, 10% or
more of the voting power at any time
within the preceding two years, in
each case referred to as an
“interested stockholder,” or an
affiliate thereof, are prohibited for

on which the interested stockholder

holding the same class of equity
securities of the target company
on substantially equivalent
terms. Within 20 business days
of the statement being filed, a
hearing is held and if it is found
that the statement does not
contain the required disclosure
or the offer is not made to
offerees on substantially
equivalent terms, the
commissioner can prohibit the
purchase of shares in the offer
or condition the purchase on
changes or modifications. In
addition, Indiana law prohibits a
bidder from acquiring any
additional equity securities of
the target company for two
years after the tender offer
unless holders of the subject
equity security are given a
reasonable opportunity to
dispose of their holdings to the
bidder on equivalent terms. The
IBCL provides that, unless an
Indiana corporation provides an
exemption in its articles of
incorporation or bylaws, any
person who makes a “control
share acquisition” may not vote
the shares acquired in that
acquisition, except to the extent
voting rights relating to those
shares are granted by a
resolution approved by a vote of
disinterested shareholders. A
“control share acquisition” is
defined as the acquisition by a
person of, or the power to direct
the voting of, shares
representing between 1/5 and
1/3, between 1/3 and 1/2, or 1/2
or more of an issuing public
corporation’s voting power in
the election of directors, either
within a 90-day period or
pursuant to a plan to make a
control share acquisition of
ownership. The acquiring person
may request, and the
corporation must call, a special

Thereafter, any such business
combination must be recommended
by the corporation’s board of
directors and approved by the
affirmative vote of at least (i) 80% of
the votes entitled to be cast by
holders of outstanding shares of
voting stock of the corporation and
(ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled to
be cast by holders of voting stock of
the corporation other than shares
held by the interested stockholder or
its affiliates or associates. The super-
majority vote requirements do not
apply, however, to business
combinations that are approved or
exempted by the corporation’s board
of directors prior to the time that the
interested stockholder becomes an
interested stockholder or the
business combination satisfies
certain minimum price, form of
consideration and procedural
requirements. As permitted under
Maryland law, the Prologis board has
by resolution opted out of the
business combination provisions of
the MGCL and, consequently, the
five-year prohibition and the super-
majority vote requirements will not
apply to business combinations
between Prologis and any interested
stockholder.
The Prologis charter provides that
holders of its stock are not entitled
to exercise any rights of an objecting
stockholder provided for under
Maryland law unless the Prologis
board determines that such rights
apply.
Under certain provisions of
Maryland law relating to unsolicited
takeovers, a Maryland corporation
with a class of equity securities
registered under the Exchange Act
and at least three independent
directors may elect to be subject, by
provision in its charter or bylaws or
by resolutions of its board of
directors and notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the charter or
shareholders’ meeting to restore
or approve voting rights after
the acquiring person delivers to
the corporation a statement
describing the acquisition or
proposed acquisition, which is
referred to as an acquiring
person statement, and an
undertaking to pay the expenses
relating to the meeting. Shares
acquired in a control share
acquisition in which no
acquiring person statement has
been filed may be redeemed by
the corporation at their fair
value, under certain
circumstances. Unless otherwise
provided in a corporation’s
articles of incorporation or
bylaws, if shares acquired in a
control share acquisition are
given full voting rights and the
acquiring person has acquired
shares representing a majority or
more of the corporation’s voting
power, then the other
shareholders will be entitled to
dissenters’ rights of appraisal.
Duke Realty has not opted out
of this provision. Under the
Duke Realty charter, the
affirmative vote of at least 80%

Shareholder Proposals and Nominations for Inclusion in Duke Realty’s Proxy Materials. SEC rules
establish the eligibility requirements and procedures that must be followed for a shareholder’s proposal to be
included in Duke Realty’s proxy materials. Under those rules, any shareholder wishing to have a proposal
considered for inclusion in the proxy materials for Duke Realty’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders must
submit his or her proposal to Duke Realty in writing on or before November 2, 2022, which is 120 calendar
days prior to the anniversary of the date the 2022 proxy statement was released to shareholders. However, if
the date of Duke Realty’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders is more than 30 calendar days earlier or later
than the anniversary date of Duke Realty’s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, then the deadline is a
reasonable time before Duke Realty begins to print and send its proxy materials. Proposals must comply with
all applicable SEC rules.
If a shareholder wishes to nominate a director for inclusion in the proxy materials for Duke Realty’s 2023
annual meeting of shareholders pursuant to Duke Realty’s proxy access bylaw provision, Duke Realty’s
bylaws require that the shareholder give advance written notice to Duke Realty’s Corporate Secretary no
earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days before the one year anniversary of the date when the proxy
materials for the previous year’s annual meeting of shareholders were released to shareholders, which for the
2023 annual meeting of shareholders would be no earlier than October 3, 2022, and no later than November 2,
2022. However, if the date of the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders is more than 30 calendar days earlier or
later than the date contemplated at the time of the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, the notice must be
received by Duke Realty’s Corporate Secretary not fewer than the later of (i) 150 calendar days prior to the
date of the contemplated annual meeting or (ii) the date which is 10 calendar days after the date of the first
public announcement or other notification to Duke Realty shareholders of the date of the contemplated
annual meeting.
Shareholder Proposals and Nominations Not for Inclusion in Duke Realty’s Proxy Materials. If a
shareholder wishes to present a proposal, including a proposal to nominate a director nominee, at the 2023
annual meeting of shareholders, even if the proposal or nomination is not intended to be included in the 2023
proxy materials, Duke Realty’s bylaws require that the shareholder give advance written notice to Duke
Realty’s Corporate Secretary at least 120 days before the one year anniversary of the date when the proxy
statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting, which, for
the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, would be November 2, 2022. However, if the date of the 2023 annual
meeting of shareholders is more than 30 calendar days earlier or later than the date contemplated at the time
of the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, the notice must be received by Duke Realty’s Corporate
Secretary not fewer than the later of (i) 150 calendar days prior to the date of the contemplated annual
meeting or (ii) the date which is 10 calendar days after the date of the first public announcement or other
notification to the shareholders of the date of the contemplated annual meeting.
If a shareholder is permitted to present a proposal at the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, but the
proposal was not included in the 2023 proxy materials, Duke Realty believes that its proxy holder would have
the discretionary authority granted by the proxy card (and as permitted under SEC rules) to vote on the
proposal if the proposal was received after January 16, 2023, which is 45 calendar days prior to the one year
anniversary of the mailing of the 2022 proxy materials.

Introduction
On June 11, 2022, Prologis, Prologis OP, Prologis Merger Sub and Prologis OP Merger Sub (we refer to
Prologis and Prologis OP collectively in this section as “we,” “our,” or “us”) entered into a merger agreement
with Duke Realty and Duke Realty OP, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
merger agreement (i) Duke Realty will merge with and into Prologis Merger Sub, with Prologis Merger Sub
continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis, (ii) thereafter, Prologis will
cause all of the outstanding equity interests of the Prologis Merger Sub to be contributed to Prologis OP in
exchange for the issuance by Prologis OP of Prologis OP common units to Prologis and/or its subsidiaries as
directed by Prologis and (iii) thereafter, Prologis OP Merger Sub will be merged with and into Duke Realty OP,
with Duke Realty OP surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis OP. A copy
of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you
to read the merger agreement carefully.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the company merger, each issued and
outstanding share of Duke Realty common stock as of immediately prior to the company merger will be
automatically converted into the right to receive 0.475 of a newly issued share of Prologis common stock,
without interest, plus the right, if any, to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Prologis common stock
into which such shares of Duke Realty common stock would have been converted pursuant to the merger
agreement. At the effective time of the partnership merger, each issued and outstanding common unit of
Duke Realty OP as of immediately prior to the partnership merger will be converted into 0.475 of a newly
issued common unit of Prologis OP. The 0.475 exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect
changes in the stock prices of Prologis common stock or Duke Realty common stock prior to closing.
Changes in the price of Prologis common stock prior to the mergers will affect the market value of the merger
consideration that Duke Realty shareholders and Duke Realty OP unitholders will be entitled to receive upon
the closing of the mergers. Subject to the approval by the stockholders of Prologis and the shareholders of
Duke Realty and the other closing conditions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the mergers
are expected to be consummated in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Based on current information, it is expected that former Duke Realty shareholders will own approximately
20% and current Prologis stockholders will own approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding Combined
Company common stock after consummation of the mergers. After consideration of all applicable factors
pursuant to the business combination accounting rules, we expect to treat the mergers as an asset
acquisition under GAAP and as a result the transaction costs will likely be capitalized to the basis of the
acquired properties.
Pro Forma Information
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements combine the historical
consolidated financial statements of Prologis and Duke Realty, including Pro Forma Balance Sheets and
Statements of Income, which we refer to as the “Pro Forma Financial Statements”.
The accompanying Pro Forma Balance Sheets at March 31, 2022 have been prepared as if the mergers had
occurred as of March 31, 2022. The accompanying Pro Forma Statements of Income for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021 have been prepared as if the mergers had
occurred as of January 1, 2021.
During the period from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022, Prologis and Duke Realty acquired and disposed
of various real estate assets. None of the assets acquired and disposed of by the respective companies
during this period, individually or in the aggregate, or acquisitions and dispositions considered probable of
closing as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, exceeded the significance level that requires
the presentation of pro forma financial information pursuant to Regulation S-X, Article 11. As such, the
following Pro Forma Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended
December 31, 2021 do not include pro forma adjustments to present the impact of these insignificant
acquisitions and dispositions as if they occurred on January 1, 2021.
177 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Pro forma adjustments, and the assumptions on which they are based, are described in the accompanying
Notes to Pro Forma Financial Statements, which are referred to in this section as the accompanying notes.
The pro forma adjustments and the purchase price allocation as presented are based on estimates and certain
information that is currently available. Under acquisition accounting, the total cost or total consideration
exchanged is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis.
All other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including debt, and real estate assets that we do not intend
to operate long-term are recorded at fair value. The total consideration and assignment of fair values to Duke
Realty’s assets and liabilities has not been finalized and is subject to change and the actual amounts at the
time the mergers are completed could vary materially from the Pro Forma Financial Statements.
The Pro Forma Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
SEC. All significant adjustments that can be factually supported, are directly attributable to the mergers and
are expected to have a continuing impact within the SEC regulations covering the preparation of the Pro
Forma Financial Statements, have been made. The Pro Forma Financial Statements are presented for
illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the combined operating results or financial
position that would have occurred if such transactions had been consummated on the dates and in
accordance with the assumptions described herein, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating
results or financial position. We expect that the mergers will create significant corporate general and
administrative as well as property operating cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in achieving these anticipated cost savings. Therefore, the Pro Forma Financial Statements
included herein do not give effect to any synergies, potential cost reductions or other operating efficiencies
that we expect to result from the mergers based on management’s plans or intent after the mergers.

that we expect to result from the mergers based on management’s plans or intent after the mergers.
You are urged to read the Pro Forma Financial Statements below together with Prologis’ and Duke Realty’s
publicly available historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Merger Consideration
For purposes of the Pro Forma Financial Statements, Prologis estimates that the mergers will be completed
for $25.4 billion through the issuance of equity based on the value of Prologis common stock and units
issued of $21.8 billion, the assumption of debt of $3.3 billion and transaction costs. The aggregate equity
consideration consists of shares of Prologis common stock and Prologis OP common units issued in
exchange for shares of Duke Realty common stock and Duke Realty OP common units and is calculated as
follows (in millions, except price per share/unit):
Number of shares of Prologis common stock and Prologis OP common units to be
issued upon conversion of shares of Duke Realty common stock and Duke Realty OP
common units at March 31, 2022
185.04
Multiplied by price of Prologis common stock on June 30, 2022
$ 117.65
Estimated fair value of shares of Prologis common stock and Prologis OP common
units to be issued
$ 21,770
Estimated transaction costs
312
Estimated aggregate consideration
$22,082
Duke Realty shareholders and Duke Realty OP unitholders will receive 0.475 of a newly issued
share of Prologis common stock or 0.475 of a newly issued Prologis OP common unit, respectively,
for each share of Duke Realty common stock or Duke Realty OP common unit, respectively, that
they own as of immediately prior to consummation of the mergers.
The estimated purchase price is based on the closing price of Prologis common stock on June 30,
2022, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Pursuant to
accounting rules, the final purchase price will be based on the price of the Prologis common stock
as of the closing date, and therefore, will be different from the amount shown above. Based

TABLE OF CONTENTS
on a sensitivity analysis, a change in the Prologis common stock price of 10% would result in an
approximate $2.2 billion change in the estimated aggregate consideration.
For purposes of the Pro Forma Financial Statements, estimated transaction costs for the mergers
were included in the estimated aggregate consideration. These estimated transaction costs are
expected to be approximately $312 million and includes the direct cost incurred in acquiring the real
estate assets. These costs will be capitalized by Prologis. Termination and severance costs for the
acceleration of unvested Duke Realty equity awards and Duke Realty OP LTIP units under Duke
Realty’s equity incentive plans that become fully vested at closing are included in the estimated
fair value of Prologis common stock and Prologis OP common units to be issued.
The Pro Forma Financial Statements included herein do not give effect to any synergies, potential cost
reductions or other operating efficiencies that we expect to result from the mergers based on management’s
plans or intent after the mergers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Notes to the Pro Forma Financial Statements
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
The following preliminary allocation of the purchase price of Duke Realty is based on the preliminary
estimate of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Duke Realty at March 31,
2022. The final determination of the allocation of the purchase price will be based on the fair value of such
assets and liabilities as of the actual consummation date of the mergers and will be completed after the
mergers are consummated. Such final determination of the purchase price may be significantly different from
the preliminary estimates used in the Pro Forma Financial Statements.
The estimated purchase price of Duke Realty of $22.1 billion (as calculated in the manner described above) is
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and assumed liabilities based on the following
preliminary basis at March 31, 2022 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Historical Financial Statements
In order to conform to the current Prologis presentation, we condensed and reclassified certain amounts
presented in the historical financial statements of Duke Realty.
Duke Realty Transaction Accounting Adjustments
Adjustments for Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheets:
Unless otherwise indicated, the pro forma adjustments apply to both Prologis and Prologis OP.
Duke Realty’s real estate assets have been adjusted to their estimated fair value at March 31, 2022. We
estimated the fair value of each property generally by applying a capitalization rate to the estimated net
operating income and adding a portfolio premium to the property based on the relative fair value of the
property in comparison to the total portfolio. We determined the capitalization rates that were
appropriate by market, based on recent appraisals, transactions or other market data. The fair value of
land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar
parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale.
Duke Realty’s historical accumulated depreciation balance is eliminated.
Duke Realty’s investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities have been adjusted to their
estimated fair value at March 31, 2022. The fair values for the investments were calculated using similar
valuation methods as those used for consolidated real estate assets and debt.
At March 31, 2022, Duke Realty had no properties that were classified as held for sale. Prologis intends
to dispose of certain of the acquired real estate assets from Duke Realty, including non-strategic
logistics properties, over the next 12 months. There was no pro forma adjustment made to reflect
Prologis’ future intent to sell these properties.

Adjustments to Duke Realty’s historical balance of other assets are as follows (in thousands):

Total
$228,767
The fair value of acquired lease intangible assets includes leasing commissions, foregone rent and
above market leases. We recognize an asset for leasing commissions based on our estimate of the
cost to lease space in the applicable markets. Foregone rents include the value of the revenue and
recovery of costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the space was vacant, in each
of the applicable markets. An asset was recognized for acquired leases with in-place rents that are
higher than our best estimate of current market rents in each of the applicable markets.
Duke Realty’s lease right-of-use assets for ground and office space leases, in which Duke Realty is
the lessee, were adjusted to their estimated value at March 31, 2022. We estimated the value of each
lease by calculating the present value of the future minimum rental payments at March 31, 2022
using Prologis’ weighted average incremental borrowing rate of 5.2%. The weighted average
remaining lease term for these leases was forty-four years at March 31, 2022.
Duke Realty’s debt balances have been adjusted to their estimated fair value at March 31, 2022. Fair
value was estimated based on contractual future cash flows discounted using borrowing spreads and
market interest rates that would have been available to us for the issuance of debt with similar terms and
remaining maturities.
Adjustments to Duke Realty’s historical balance of other liabilities are as follows (in thousands):
Elimination of deferred revenue

Total
$1,221,578
The fair value of acquired lease intangible liabilities includes a liability for acquired leases with in-
place rents that are lower than our best estimate of current market rents in each of the applicable
markets.
Duke Realty’s lease liabilities for ground and office space leases, in which Duke Realty is the
lessee, were adjusted to their estimated value at March 31, 2022. We estimated the value of each
lease by calculating the present value of the future minimum rental payments at March 31, 2022
using Prologis’ weighted average incremental borrowing rate of 5.2%. The weighted average
remaining lease term for these leases was forty-four years at March 31, 2022.
Adjustments represent the elimination of historical Duke Realty balances and the issuance of Prologis
common stock and Prologis OP common units in exchange for shares of Duke Realty common stock and
Duke Realty OP common units, respectively, in the mergers. The adjustment for the Duke Realty OP
unitholders is based on the Duke Realty OP unitholders’ share of the total net asset pro forma
adjustments at March 31, 2022. This adjustment reflected the Duke Realty OP unitholders’ ownership
percentage of 1.3% at March 31, 2022.
The adjustment for noncontrolling interests in the consolidated entities at March 31, 2022 is based on
the noncontrolling interests’ share in the fair value adjustments for real estate and debt as described
above.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Adjustments for Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income:
The pro forma adjustments to the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income assume that a
purchase price allocation done as of January 1, 2021 was equivalent to amounts assigned based on the
estimated purchase price allocation done at March 31, 2022 and reflected in the Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Balance Sheets.
Rental revenue is adjusted to remove Duke Realty’s historical straight-line rent and amortization of the
net below market lease intangible liability of $10.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for the three
months ended March 31, 2022, and $32.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Rental revenue is further adjusted to recognize acquired leases on a straight-line
basis and the amortization of the net below market lease intangible liability of $9.3 million and $56.4
million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and $59.5 million and $238.6 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. For purposes of the above or below market rent
adjustments, we estimated a weighted average remaining lease term associated with these leases of five
years.
We expect that the mergers will create significant corporate general and administrative as well as
property operating cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving
these anticipated cost savings. Therefore, the Pro Forma Financial Statements included herein do not
give effect to any synergies, potential cost reductions or other operating efficiencies that we expect to
result from the mergers based on management’s plans or intent after the mergers.
Depreciation and amortization expense is adjusted to remove $94.0 million and $362.1 million of Duke
Realty’s historical depreciation and amortization expense and recognize $193.7 million and $821.2 million
of depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and the year
ended December 31, 2021, respectively. For purposes of this adjustment, we estimated the various
components of the real estate acquired and used an estimated average useful life of 30 years for
operating properties and an estimated weighted average remaining lease term associated with in-place
leases at March 31, 2022 that approximated five years.
We adjusted Duke Realty’s investment in unconsolidated entities to fair value. As a result, we adjusted
the equity in earnings that Duke Realty recognized from these entities to reflect the impact the
amortization of these fair value adjustments would have had on earnings from these unconsolidated
entities.
We adjusted Duke Realty’s interest expense based on the fair value of debt. The adjustment to interest
expense includes the removal of Duke Realty’s historical interest expense, including amortization of
deferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts, and calculation of interest expense based on
the estimated fair value of acquired debt, net of amounts capitalized. The weighted average interest rate
associated with the debt at fair value was 4.5% at March 31, 2022 (see note G).
An adjustment was made to reflect the income allocated to noncontrolling interests in the co-investment
entities that Duke Realty consolidates to reflect the impact the amortization of these fair value
adjustments would have had on the earnings of the noncontrolling interests or third parties. In addition,
an adjustment was made to reflect the Duke Realty OP unitholders’ ownership percentage of 1.3% in all
of the pro forma adjustments described above.

represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii): (i) a letter of transmittal (a “Letter of
Transmittal”) which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof),
to the Exchange Agent, which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other customary
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree upon, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with
any amounts payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section 3.8
and dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
3.3(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent,
together with such Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, plus any
Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.8 and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(e) to be mailed or
delivered by wire transfer, as soon as reasonably practicable following the later to occur of (A) the
Company Merger Effective Time or (B) the Exchange Agent’s receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof), and such Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the
Company Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article III. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof).
(d) Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were

Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon the conversion of any Book-
Entry Share.
(e) Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Company Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or unsurrendered Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be
paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or the
conversion of such Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Company Merger Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Company Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender
and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock.
(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any Fractional Share
Consideration and any applicable dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock) which remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for six (6)
months after the Company Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
former holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Company Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article III.
(g) No Liability. None of the Parent Parties, the Company Parties, the Exchange Agent, or any employee,
officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person if any portion of the Exchange
Fund has been delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear
of any claims or interest of such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives
previously entitled thereto.
(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash portion of the Exchange
Fund, as directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or other income produced by, such
investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent or the
Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Article III. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt payments of any of the cash payments contemplated by Section 3.3(e) or
Section 3.8, Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, replace or restore the portion of the
Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the

all of which were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities
Laws. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports (other than preliminary materials) (i)
complied (or with respect to Company SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will comply) as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Laws and (ii) at the time of filing or being

SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will not) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent such
statements have been modified or superseded by later Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to
the SEC and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement and provided that no representation
or warranty is made hereunder as to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus that were not supplied by or on behalf of the Company or the Partnership.
Neither the Company nor the Partnership has any outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC
with respect to the Company SEC Reports. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income, retained
earnings and cash flows of the Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company

party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement,
including any contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any “off-balance sheet arrangements”  (as defined in Item 303 of
Regulation S-K), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or such
Company’s or Company Subsidiary’s audited financial statements or other Company SEC Reports.
(c) There are no liabilities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary of a nature that would be

deficiencies or material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (whether or
not remediated) and no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. The Company is not aware of any change in its internal control over financial
reporting that has occurred since December 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2019, the
Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company and
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure, (i) to the Company’s Knowledge, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company to material information relating to the Company required to be included
in the reports the Company is required to file under the Exchange Act, and (ii) the Company’s principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) all known
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the
Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) any known
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. The principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and the statements contained in all such certifications
were, as of their respective dates made, complete and correct in all material respects.

may make a Change in Parent Recommendation (but only as set forth in clauses (A) or (C) or, to the
extent related to clauses (A) or (C), clause (G) of Section 7.4(b)(iii)), as applicable, if and only if (A)

applicable, under applicable Law; provided, however, that in the event the Company Board or the
Parent Board, as applicable does not make such a Change in Company Recommendation or a
Change in Parent Recommendation, as applicable, following such Intervening Event Notice Period,
but thereafter determines to make such a Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in
Parent Recommendation, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 7.4(b)(v) in circumstances not

14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (B) making any other disclosure to its stockholders

Parent Board or the Company Board, as applicable, reasonably determines (after consultation with

pending disclosure of its position thereunder; provided, however, that any such disclosure that
addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Parent Board or the
Company Board, as applicable, with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be a change in Parent Recommendation or a Change in Company Recommendation, as
applicable, unless the Parent Board or the Company Board, as applicable, in connection with such
communication publicly states that the Parent Recommendation or the Company Recommendation,
as applicable, has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of Parent or the Company, as
applicable, without disclosing any Change in Parent Recommendation or Change in Company
Recommendation, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Parent Board nor the
Company Board may make a Change in Parent Recommendation or a Change in Company
Recommendation, as applicable, unless in compliance with Section 7.4(b)(iv) or Section 7.4(b)(v).
(c) Upon execution of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company agrees that it will and will cause

Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.4 by such Party for purposes of this
Agreement.
(d) Notwithstanding any Change in Company Recommendation, unless such Change in Company
Recommendation is with respect to a Superior Proposal and this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1(e), the Company shall cause the approval of this Agreement to be submitted to a vote of its
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding any Change in Parent
Recommendation, Parent shall cause the approval of the Parent Common Stock Issuance to be submitted
to a vote of its stockholders at the Parent Stockholder Meeting.
(e) Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), approval of this Agreement is the only matter, other than any say-on-golden parachute vote
that may be required pursuant to Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder
and a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies, in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, that the Company shall
propose to be acted on by its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Without the prior
written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
approval of Parent Common Stock Issuance is the only matter, other than a proposal to approve the
adjournment of the Parent Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies,
in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Parent Stockholder Meeting to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval, that Parent shall propose to be acted on by its stockholders at the Parent

cause Parent OP to), for a period of six (6) years from the Company Merger Effective Time: (i) indemnify
and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or is during any of the period
from the date hereof until the Company Merger Effective Time, serving as a manager, director, officer,
trustee or fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and acting in such capacity
(collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) to the fullest extent that an Indiana corporation is permitted to
indemnify and hold harmless its own such Persons under the applicable Laws of the State of Indiana, as
now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim with respect to matters occurring on or before
the Company Merger Effective Time and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and
other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting
from such Claim; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the
fullest extent that an Indiana corporation is permitted to indemnify and hold harmless its own such
Persons under the applicable Laws of the State of Indiana, as now or hereafter in effect, any Claim
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with
respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each
case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to Parent’s receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately
determined under applicable Laws or any of the Company Governing Documents that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting that indemnification is required in accordance with this Section 7.5 with respect to a
Claim, then the provisions for indemnification contained in this Section 7.5 with respect to such Claim
shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time and shall continue to
apply until such time as such Claim is fully and finally resolved. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in, or seek termination with respect to, any actual
or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such Claim. No Indemnified Party shall be liable for
any amounts paid in any settlement effected without its prior express written consent. No Indemnified
Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in, or seek termination with
respect to, any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Party hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld).

Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, trustees, agents or
fiduciaries of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Governing

Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be

prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, any Indemnified Party
delivers to Parent a written notice asserting that indemnification is required in accordance with this
Section 7.5 with respect to a Claim, then the provisions for indemnification contained in this Section 7.5
with respect to such Claim shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Company Merger Effective
Time and shall continue to apply until such time as such Claim is fully and finally resolved.
(c) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for,
and Parent shall maintain in full force and effect (and the obligations under to be honored), during the
six (6) year period beginning on the date of the Company Merger Effective Time, a “tail” prepaid
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy or policies (which policy or policies by their respective
express terms shall survive the Mergers) from the Company’s current insurance carrier or an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier, of at least the
same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ existing directors’ and

insurance as reasonably available for an aggregate cost equal to the Maximum Premium.

provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.5.

heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this Section 7.5 shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or exculpation which an
Indemnified Party and other Person referred to in this Section 7.5 is entitled, whether pursuant to

Third Party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this

or any of its Representatives (provided, however, that the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of such Law or legal duty), (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege or would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the disclosing Party
(provided, however, that the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does not result

(h) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 9.3 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee nor the
Expense Amount is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such amounts are due
and payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and (iii) without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if either Parent or the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 9.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against Parent or the Company, as applicable, for the payment of any amount set forth in this

connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of the prime rate as

from the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee deposited into escrow in accordance with the next
sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as
applicable, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to such other Party (or its
designee) without causing such other Party (or its designee) to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A) through (H) or 856(c)(3)(A) through (I) of the
Code (“Qualifying Income”), as determined by such other Party’s independent certified public
accountants (taking into account any known or anticipated income of such other Party which is not
Qualifying Income and any appropriate “cushion” as determined by such accountants), plus (B) in the
event such other Party receives either (1) a letter from such other Party’s counsel indicating that such
other Party has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 9.4(b)(ii) or (2) an opinion from such
other Party’s outside counsel as described in Section 9.4(b)(ii), an amount equal to the excess of the
Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, less the amount payable under clause (A)
above. To secure Parent or the Company’s obligation to pay these amounts, as applicable, Parent or the
Company, as applicable, shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Expense Amount
and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, with an escrow agent selected by Parent or the Company, as
applicable (that is reasonably satisfactory to the other Party) and on such terms (subject to Section
9.4(b)) as shall be mutually agreed in good faith upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent.
The payment or deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee, as applicable,
pursuant to this Section 9.4(a) shall be made, at the time Parent or the Company is obligated to pay the
other Party such amount pursuant to Section 9.3, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee, as applicable,
in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent or the Company, as applicable (or its
designee), unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from
such Party’s independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid
by the escrow agent to such Party (or its designee) without causing such Party (or its designee) to fail
to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from such Party’s accountants
revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to such Party (or its
designee), or (ii) a letter from such Party’s counsel indicating that such Party received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by such Party (or its designee) of the Expense Amount and/or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, indicating
that such Party’s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by such
Party (or its designee) of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Expense
Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, to such Party (or its designee). Each of Parent and
the Company agrees to amend this Section 9.4(b) at the request of the other Party in order to (x)
maximize the portion of the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, that may be
distributed to such other Party (or its designee) hereunder without causing such other Party (or its
designee) to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve such
other Party’s chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 9.4(b) or (z) assist such
other Party in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section
9.4(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Expense Amount and/or
Termination Fee, as applicable, that remains unpaid as of the end of the taxable year shall be paid as
soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section
9.4; provided, that the obligation of Parent or the Company, as applicable, to pay the unpaid portion of
the Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, shall terminate on the December 31
following the date which is five (5) years from the date of this Agreement and any such unpaid portion
shall be released by the escrow agent to Parent or the Company, as applicable. Parent (in the case of
Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, payable by Parent) or the Company (in the case
of Expense Amount and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, payable by the Company) shall not be a party
to such escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have liability resulting from the escrow
agreement.
