as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company Option”) will, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option by

Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint common stock
underlying such Unvested Company Option (the “Unvested Company Option Consideration”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with
Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company
Option Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option from which such Unvested
Company Option Consideration was converted would have vested pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain

of, the Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the Company
ESPP). On such exercise date, SailPoint will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each participant’s payroll
withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of SailPoint common stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP and each share
purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, subject to withholding of any applicable withholding taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under
the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Company ESPP, be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest).

The receipt of cash by SailPoint Stockholders in exchange for shares of SailPoint common stock in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of SailPoint
common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the

If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, SailPoint Stockholders who continuously hold shares of SailPoint common stock
through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares
and who do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection
with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that SailPoint Stockholders may be entitled to have their shares of SailPoint common
stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of SailPoint common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be “fair value,” if any, as determined by the court (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the “fair value” and the amount paid
by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each SailPoint Stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal
proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, SailPoint Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
SailPoint Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the
Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of SailPoint common stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, SailPoint Stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to SailPoint before the vote is taken on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii)
continue to hold shares of SailPoint common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for
exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal
rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of SailPoint unless certain stock ownership
conditions are satisfied by SailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further
detail in this proxy statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal
rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of SailPoint common stock
through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights.”

Upon the recommendation of a special committee of the Board of Directors (the “Special Committee” or “Committee”), the Board of Directors has
unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of SailPoint and SailPoint Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger
Agreement; (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby; and (iii) resolved to recommend that SailPoint Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors unanimously
recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation
Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-
binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint Stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Board of Directors may withdraw or
change the foregoing recommendation if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that failure to do
so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to SailPoint Stockholders under applicable law.
However, the Board of Directors cannot withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger
Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent and its representatives in good faith over a five (5)-business-day period, after
which the Board of Directors shall have determined that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation”) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to SailPoint Stockholders under
applicable law. The termination of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint following the Board of Directors’ authorization for SailPoint to enter into a
definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Go-Shop Period—Solicitation of Other Offers”) will result in the
payment by SailPoint of a termination fee of either (i) $81,750,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 26,
2022 with respect to an Excluded Party (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement

In connection with the Merger, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ( “Morgan Stanley”) rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, that as of April 10, 2022, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the $65.25 per share in cash
to be received by holders of shares of SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement
was fair from a financial point of view to such SailPoint Stockholders, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.”
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of April 10, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,

When considering the foregoing recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
SailPoint Stockholders should be aware that certain of SailPoint’s non-employee directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that
are different from, or in addition to, those of SailPoint Stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests,
among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and recommending
that the Merger Agreement be adopted by SailPoint Stockholders. These interests include:
•
at the Effective Time, each Company Option and Company RSU held by an executive officer or director will receive the treatment
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in
the Merger—Treatment and Quantification of Company Equity Awards”;
•
eligibility of SailPoint’s executive officers to receive severance payments and benefits (including equity award vesting acceleration)
under the Severance Pay Plan, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of
Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger—Severance Pay Plan”;
•
eligibility of certain of SailPoint’s executive officers to receive a cash transaction or retention bonus, as described in more detail in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger—
Transaction and Retention Bonus Programs”; and
•
continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving Corporation.
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of SailPoint common stock held by SailPoint directors and executive officers
will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock held by all other SailPoint Stockholders. For more information,

The Go-Shop Period—Solicitation of Other Alternative Acquisition Proposals
Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on May 16, 2022 (such date, the “No-Shop Period
Start Date” and such period, the “Go-Shop Period”), SailPoint, its affiliates and their respective representatives had the right to, among other things:
(i) solicit, initiate, propose, induce the making or submission of, encourage or facilitate in any way any offer or proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Go-Shop Period—Solicitation of Other Offers”), including by providing information (including non-public
information and data) of or affording access to SailPoint and its subsidiaries to any third person that has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Go-Shop Period—
Solicitation of Other Offers”); and (ii) continue, enter into, engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third
person regarding any Alternative Acquisition Proposals, and cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate in any way, any such

inquiries, offers, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Alternative Acquisition Proposals or other proposals
that could reasonably be expected to lead to Alternative Acquisition Proposals, including by granting a waiver, amendment or release under any pre-
existing “standstill” or other similar provision to the extent necessary to allow for an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or amendment to an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal to be made confidentially to SailPoint or to the Board of Directors. SailPoint did not receive any offer or proposal
that constituted, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal during the Go-Shop Period.
The No-Shop Period—No Solicitation of Other Alternative Acquisition Proposals
Under the Merger Agreement, from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time, SailPoint may not: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage, or knowingly facilitate the making or submission of any offer or proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-public information to, any person relating
to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or would be reasonably expected to lead
to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) enter into any contract relating to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, other than a confidentiality
agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under certain specified circumstances, from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by SailPoint Stockholders, SailPoint may, among other things, engage in negotiations or discussions with, and provide information to, a
third party (and its representatives and potential debt and equity financing sources) in respect of an Alternative Acquisition Proposal that was not
received in response to or as a result of SailPoint’s obligations set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, if the Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors, that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Go-Shop Period—
Solicitation of Other Offers”) or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has
determined in good faith that the failure to take the actions in respect of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement—The No-Shop Period—No Solicitation of Other Offers.”
Both during the Go-Shop Period and after the No-Shop Period Start Date but prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint
Stockholders, SailPoint is entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal only if it
complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a five (5)-
business-day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and other agreements so that such Superior Proposal
no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, amended pursuant to such
negotiations.
The termination of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint following the Board of Directors’ authorization for SailPoint to enter into a definitive
agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal will result in the payment by SailPoint of a termination
fee of either (i) $81,750,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 26, 2022 with respect to an Excluded
Party and SailPoint has complied in all material respects with the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal or (ii) $212,540,000, in the case of any other such termination. For more information, please see the section of this proxy

circumstances, including by mutual agreement, the imposition of non-appealable court orders that permanently enjoin or otherwise prohibit the

Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A:
Yes. If you are a SailPoint Stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website on
June 30, 2022, and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you sign and return your proxy card. If you are a SailPoint Stockholder of record, you

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the
voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the
proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may
not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
What will I receive in respect of my shares of SailPoint common stock if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration of $65.25 in cash, less any applicable
withholding taxes, for each share of SailPoint common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal
rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of SailPoint common stock, you will receive $6,525.00 in cash in exchange for your
shares of SailPoint common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
What will the holders of outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger:
Each Vested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share
Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option, by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint common
stock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to any required withholding of taxes.
Each Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per
Share Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option, by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint
common stock underlying such Unvested Company Option. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts will vest
and become payable at the same time as the Company Option from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would
have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the
Unvested Company Option Consideration.
Each Vested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of SailPoint
common stock underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to any required withholding of taxes.
Each Unvested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of
SailPoint common stock underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration. Subject to the holder’s continued service with
Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company
RSU Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Company RSU from which such Unvested Company RSU
Consideration was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company

RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company RSU Consideration.
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any SailPoint Stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy
over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card); or (iii) vote in person by virtual ballot at the Special
Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name”
and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the
Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-
binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Q:
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a quorum?
A:
The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting as of the record date must be
present at the Special Meeting in order to hold the Special Meeting and conduct business. This presence is called a quorum. Your shares are
counted as present at the Special Meeting if you are present and vote in person at the Special Meeting or if you have properly submitted a proxy.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by SailPoint Stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, SailPoint Stockholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of SailPoint common stock. Instead, SailPoint will remain an independent public company, SailPoint
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic
reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, SailPoint will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of either $212,540,000 or $81,750,000, upon the termination
of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—
Termination Fee.”
Q:
Why are SailPoint Stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require SailPoint to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments
that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
16
Table of Contents
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A:
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of voting power of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required for approval of the Compensation Proposal.
Q:
What will happen if SailPoint Stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is
an advisory vote and will not be binding on SailPoint. Therefore, if the other requisite SailPoint Stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger
is completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to SailPoint’s named executive officers in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the Merger
Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other
things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that
your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the
voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
A:
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, SailPoint
Stockholders of record who do not vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the “fair value” of their
shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware if the merger is completed. Appraisal rights will only be available to
SailPoint Stockholders who properly deliver, and do not properly withdraw, a written demand for an appraisal to SailPoint prior to the vote on the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the amount a SailPoint
Stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to
this proxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger—Appraisal Rights.”
Q:
Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the paying agent will send each holder of record a letter of transmittal and written instructions that explain how
to exchange shares of SailPoint common stock represented by such holder’s book-entry shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of SailPoint common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you
sell or transfer your shares of SailPoint common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as
provision of a proxy) are
17
Table of Contents
made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies SailPoint in writing of such special
arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell
or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares
of SailPoint common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a SailPoint Stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (“AST”), you are
considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “SailPoint Stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have
been sent directly to you by SailPoint.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of SailPoint common stock
held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with
respect to those shares, to be the SailPoint Stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because
you are not the SailPoint Stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy”
from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a SailPoint Stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of SailPoint common stock are registered in your name with AST, our transfer
agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or

by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of SailPoint common stock, and
to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote
electronically over the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each
case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of SailPoint common stock by proxy. If
you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of SailPoint
common stock in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special
Meeting and vote in person by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee, electronically

over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the
instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special
Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you
voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the adjournment proposal.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a SailPoint Stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special
Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of SailPoint; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.
If you hold your shares of SailPoint common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or
other nominee.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of SailPoint common stock. The written document describing the matters to
be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of
SailPoint common stock is called a “proxy card.” Mark D. McClain, our director and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Schmitt, our Executive Vice
President, General Counsel and Secretary, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, with full power of substitution and re-substitution.
Q:
If a SailPoint Stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way
that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for
or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one (1) set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed
proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one (1) set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one (1) brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card
for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a SailPoint Stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one
(1) name, you will receive more than one (1) proxy card.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the Special Meeting. The inspector of
elections will also determine whether a quorum is present.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
SailPoint intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports
that SailPoint files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of SailPoint common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
A:
The exchange of SailPoint common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”) who exchanges shares of SailPoint common stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If
you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have certain connections with the United States, but
may be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax unless you comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish a valid exemption
from U.S. backup withholding tax.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the second half of 2022.
However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted, because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the
Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
The expenses of soliciting proxies will be paid by SailPoint. SailPoint has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in soliciting proxies for a
fee of up to $75,000, plus costs and expenses. SailPoint
20
Table of Contents
and its agents may solicit proxies by mail, electronic mail, telephone, facsimile, by other similar means, or in person. Our directors, officers, and other
employees, without additional compensation, and employees of Innisfree M&A Incorporated may solicit proxies personally or in writing, by
telephone, email, or otherwise. SailPoint will request brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders to forward copies of the soliciting
materials to persons for whom they hold shares and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, SailPoint, upon the request of
the record holders, will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses. If you choose to access the proxy materials through the internet, you
are responsible for any internet access charges you may incur.
Q:
What if during the check-in time or during the meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the virtual meeting website?
A:
SailPoint will have technicians ready to assist you with any technical difficulties you may have accessing the virtual meeting website. If you
encounter any difficulties accessing the Special Meeting during the check-in time or during the Special Meeting, please call the technical support
number that will be posted on the Special Meeting log-in page.
Q:
Do any of SailPoint’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ from those of SailPoint Stockholders
generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be
aware that SailPoint’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of SailPoint
Stockholders generally. The Board of Directors and the Special Committee were aware of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests
existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in making their respective
recommendations and determinations, including in the case of the Board of Directors, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in
recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by SailPoint Stockholders. For a description of the interests of SailPoint’s directors and
executive officers in the Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger.”

The holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of all shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, present in person or

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. As of
the Record Date, 47,169,638 votes constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by
SailPoint Stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger.
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of voting power of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of the majority of voting power of capital
stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
If a SailPoint Stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if SailPoint Stockholders voted “AGAINST” the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. A so-called “broker
non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide
discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not
received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. SailPoint does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting
because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are
considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be
permitted to vote your shares of SailPoint common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to
vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.",33,34

its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement; (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger
Agreement by SailPoint, the performance by SailPoint of its covenants under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereof, including the Merger; and (iii) resolved to recommend that SailPoint Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by SailPoint Stockholders of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the second half of 2022.
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, SailPoint Stockholders who continuously hold shares of SailPoint common stock through the Effective Time, who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or
otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.
This means that SailPoint Stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and who follow the
procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and
to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of SailPoint common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be “fair value,” if any, (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
—Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the “fair value” and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger to each SailPoint Stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, SailPoint Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger
Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to SailPoint before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold your shares of
SailPoint common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal
rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions
are satisfied by SailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant
section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and
incorporated herein by reference. If you hold your shares of SailPoint common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to
exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a
demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee.

Background of the Merger",41,41
"Sailpoint Technologies Holdings, Inc._20220531_DEFM14A_20138375_4470787.Pdf",Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
As part of SailPoint’s ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board and SailPoint’s management periodically
review, consider and assess SailPoint’s operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic
goals and plans. This review at times includes, among other things, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions
and other financial and strategic alternatives.
From SailPoint’s initial public offering in November 2017 until August 2018, Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates reported holding a controlling stake in
SailPoint. By the end of 2018, Thoma Bravo beneficially owned less than 5% of SailPoint’s outstanding common stock.
In April 2020, SailPoint management commenced a review of the Company’s strategic direction for its products and SaaS services to expand beyond
traditional identity governance and, in the third quarter of 2020, SailPoint
32Table of Contents
engaged a nationally recognized consulting firm to validate and review its strategic direction to drive growth. As part of the review, the consulting firm
assessed target segment opportunities for a possible buyside acquisition strategy by SailPoint. As part of that engagement, the consulting firm identified
several priority areas for possible inorganic expansion, including data governance, machine identities, and cloud identity.
In the third quarter of 2021, SailPoint management requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the Company’s financial capacity to undertake acquisitions,
including large-scale acquisitions. In October 2021, Morgan Stanley discussed with the Board the valuation environment and observations for SailPoint
to consider with respect to potential large-scale acquisitions, including the challenges associated with executing potential large-scale transactions with
data governance (DG) companies as a result of limitations associated with the Company’s financial and leverage capacity at its then-current market
capitalization. For a number of reasons, including significant volatility in SailPoint’s trading price during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 as well as
the then-prevailing valuations of potential target companies, the Board and Company management believed during the second half of 2021 that it was not
viable at that time to pursue a DG company acquisition or other large-scale acquisition.
In early December 2021, in the context of the Company’s continuing review of the strategic direction for its products and SaaS services, management
determined that it would be sensible to approach Thoma Bravo for outside input on SailPoint’s Identity Security vision as a longtime former investor in
the Company and one that is highly knowledgeable about SailPoint and the infrastructure software and cybersecurity sectors generally. Prior to meeting
with Thoma Bravo, management consulted with members of the Board about this determination. On December 7, 2021, members of Company management
met with representatives of Thoma Bravo and discussed with them the Company’s Identity Security vision, challenges and market environment and
opportunity. Company management did not solicit, intend to solicit or expect any indication of interest from Thoma Bravo to undertake any strategic
transaction or partnership with the Company.
On December 10, 2021, Thoma Bravo representatives called Mr. Mark McClain, CEO of SailPoint. On the call, they expressed interest in exploring a
potential strategic transaction between SailPoint and Thoma Bravo and requested that Thoma Bravo be permitted to enter into a non-disclosure
agreement to commence due diligence in connection with such exploration of a potential transaction. Mr. McClain stated to the Thoma Bravo
representatives that he would need to discuss this request with the Board. Mr. McClain did not comment on any such potential transaction with Thoma
Bravo and made no commitment to permit Thoma Bravo to enter into a non-disclosure agreement. Following the call, Mr. McClain and other members of
Company management gave an update regarding the call to Mr. William Bock, chairperson of the Board, who directed Company management to reach out
to outside counsel and schedule a Board meeting to discuss Thoma Bravo’s unsolicited outreach.
On December 13, 2021, a Thoma Bravo representative called Mr. McMartin to inquire whether he could discuss due diligence requests. Mr. McMartin
reiterated to the Thoma Bravo representative that he was not authorized to have any such discussion and that he would need to discuss the request with
the Board.
On December 14, 2021, a Thoma Bravo representative called Mr. McClain to request an update. Mr. McClain stated that a Board meeting had been
scheduled and that he expected that he would have a response to Thoma Bravo’s request following the meeting.
On December 14, 2021, the Board met by videoconference to discuss the unsolicited outreach by Thoma Bravo to Mr. McClain. Members of SailPoint
management also attended the meeting. The Board requested a meeting to understand from outside counsel its advice regarding the Board’s fiduciary
duties with respect to inbound interest in a potential strategic transaction and related matters before making a decision on whether and how to respond to
Thoma Bravo’s unsolicited outreach. The Board also directed Company management to convey to Thoma Bravo that the Board was considering a
response to Thoma Bravo’s unsolicited outreach and possible next steps, if any, and to request that Thoma Bravo await the outcome of that evaluation.
33
Table of Contents
On December 16, 2021, at the direction of the Board as discussed above, Mr. McClain called a Thoma Bravo representative and conveyed that the Board
was considering a response to Thoma Bravo’s unsolicited outreach and possible next steps, if any, and requested that Thoma Bravo await the outcome of
that evaluation. The Thoma Bravo representative responded that Thoma Bravo would wait as requested.
On December 17, 2021, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and, at the direction of Mr. Bock as described above,
representatives of Goodwin Procter LLP, SailPoint’s outside counsel (“Goodwin”), also attended the meeting. Representatives of Goodwin discussed
directors’ fiduciary duties in this context in connection with the evaluation of a potential strategic transaction involving SailPoint, whether with Thoma
Bravo or any other counterparty, including that under Delaware law, the Board could “just say no” to offers for a potential transaction, even if compelling.
The Board also discussed disclosure of relationships between directors and Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates to the other directors. The Board discussed
potentially establishing a special committee at the appropriate time, should the Board consider engaging with Thoma Bravo on a potential transaction, in
light of potential conflicts of interest or potential appearances of conflicts of interest arising from relationships with Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates.
Furthermore, the Board discussed that Company management should not discuss with Thoma Bravo the involvement, compensation or equity
participation of Company management in the business from and after the consummation of any potential transaction, and throughout the process leading
up to the execution of the Merger Agreement, no such discussion was held between Company management and Thoma Bravo. At the meeting, the Board
and its advisors also discussed the importance of understanding the Company’s current long-range plan and projections, the current value of the
Company and available strategic opportunities before determining how to respond to Thoma Bravo’s outreach. Accordingly, the Board then authorized
SailPoint management to develop a set of long-range plans and projections to fiscal year 2026, expanding on the three-year plan that SailPoint
management had been developing at the time on a standalone basis. The Board also requested that, in the meantime, management continue to
confidentially consider and evaluate various strategic opportunities, including but not limited to potential acquisitions of DG companies by SailPoint.
In accordance with the direction of the Board, SailPoint management then proceeded to develop a set of long-range plans and projections, including the
related methodology, underlying assumptions and related risks and preliminary financial forecasts for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. After management’s
completion of this draft, on January 6, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin also
attended the meeting. Members of SailPoint management led a discussion of this draft. Following discussion, the Board requested that Company
management incorporate additional cash flow analyses into this draft. At the January 6, 2022 meeting, the Board and management also continued to
discuss various strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions by the Company, execution risks facing the Company and the Company’s go-to-
market strategy and account acquisition metrics.
On January 10, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management led a discussion about the draft long-range plans and
projections presented at the Board’s January 6, 2022 meeting, as updated to incorporate additional cash flow analyses as requested by the Board at that
meeting (as so updated, the “January 2022 Projections”). Following discussion, the Board approved the January 2022 Projections for use by Morgan
Stanley to prepare a preliminary financial analysis of the Company and present to the Board strategic alternatives reasonably available to the Company.
The Board also discussed the formal engagement of Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction, noting
SailPoint’s longstanding relationship with Morgan Stanley, including Morgan Stanley’s work with SailPoint in connection with SailPoint’s ongoing
strategic review, as well as Morgan Stanley’s extensive expertise, knowledge of the industry in which SailPoint operates and experience advising software
companies in connection with potential strategic transactions (including but not limited to advising companies that had previously been approached by
Thoma Bravo). On the basis of these considerations, and subject in all respects to the Board’s review of a customary relationships disclosure to be
produced by Morgan Stanley, the Board authorized SailPoint to engage Morgan Stanley, and, as described below, following negotiations over the terms
of the engagement between the Special Committee (as defined below) and Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley was formally engaged on March 18, 2022
effective as of January 10, 2022.

Table of Contents
On January 13, 2022, a Thoma Bravo representative called Mr. McClain seeking an update on whether the Company had a response yet to Thoma Bravo’s
request to enter into a non-disclosure agreement and to begin discussions on a potential strategic transaction. Mr. McClain stated to the Thoma Bravo
representative that he was not authorized to have any such discussion and that he would need to discuss the request with the Board.
Later on January 13, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management also attended the meeting and representatives of
Goodwin and Morgan Stanley attended portions of the meeting. Morgan Stanley gave a comprehensive presentation on (i) market and industry
dynamics, (ii) SailPoint’s trading performance since its initial public offering, (iii) M&A activity in the software and technology industries, (iv) Thoma
Bravo’s acquisition and bidding history, and (v) Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the universe of other potential strategic and financial sponsor acquirors of
the Company. Morgan Stanley then presented its preliminary financial analysis of the Company based on the January 2022 Projections and the Board
discussed this financial analysis. Following discussion, the Board instructed Morgan Stanley to respond to Thoma Bravo (i) stating that the Company
was not for sale, (ii) stating that, at a minimum, the Board believes that full year 2021 and fourth quarter 2021 financial results must first be released before
the Board was prepared to even consider a potential transaction, and (iii) conveying to Thoma Bravo that, in light of the strength of the Company’s
business and the fact that Company was not for sale, any premium in any proposal must exceed traditional M&A market premiums prevailing in the
industry.
On January 20, 2022, Morgan Stanley called Thoma Bravo and conveyed the Board’s message described in clause (iii) above. On the call, Thoma Bravo
conveyed that Thoma Bravo would be prepared to focus on a premium to the intrinsic value of the Company, rather than on a premium to recent trading
price, which may result in a significant premium to the then-current trading price. Following this call, a Thoma Bravo representative called Mr. McClain
and such representative confirmed that Thoma Bravo would await a determination of the Board on next steps, if any, but reiterated a desire to be able to
start due diligence, which Mr. McClain reiterated is a decision reserved for the Board. Later that day, Mr. McClain gave an update to the Board on the
exchanges between Thoma Bravo and Morgan Stanley and himself which occurred on that day. The Board reiterated that full year 2021 and fourth quarter
2021 financial results must first be released before the Board was prepared to even consider a potential transaction. As a result, the Board determined (i)
not to permit Thoma Bravo to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the Company, (ii) not to permit Thoma Bravo access to due diligence, (iii) not to
otherwise engage further with Thoma Bravo and (iv) for Company management to continue to operate the Company as an independent, publicly traded
company, while continuing to consider and evaluate various strategic opportunities, including but not limited to potential acquisitions by SailPoint.
Morgan Stanley conveyed this determination to Thoma Bravo on January 20, 2022.
On February 28, 2022, SailPoint issued its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results, announcing significant year-over-year increases in total
annual recurring revenue, total revenue and subscription revenue, as well as its guidance for 2022. SailPoint’s trading price increased 14% in the
subsequent two trading days.
On March 1, 2022, Mr. McClain received a call from a representative of Thoma Bravo. On the call, the Thoma Bravo representative conveyed that it would
soon submit a non-binding letter of intent to acquire the Company. On the same day, Morgan Stanley also received a call from a representative of Thoma
Bravo who conveyed substantially the same message. On these calls, Mr. McClain and Morgan Stanley each conveyed to Thoma Bravo that it was
Thoma Bravo’s prerogative to submit a non-binding letter of intent and therefore the Company would not try to stop Thoma Bravo from doing so.
Later on March 2, 2022, SailPoint received an unsolicited non-binding letter of intent from Thoma Bravo to acquire SailPoint for $60.00 per share in cash
(the “March 2 Proposal”). The $60.00 per share offer price implied a premium to SailPoint’s last closing price prior to March 2, 2022 of approximately 34%.
The March 2 Proposal also noted that (i) the full consideration would be financed with a combination of equity from Thoma Bravo funds and debt from
one or more of Thoma Bravo’s lending partners, (ii) the transaction would not be subject to any financing contingencies, (iii) Thoma Bravo envisioned a
“30-day closed go-shop” and (iv) Thoma Bravo was
35
Table of Contents
making certain assumptions underlying its offer price, including as to the Company’s cash position and the dilutive effect of the Company’s equity
awards and convertible notes, and that the Company’s unvested dilutive securities would be paid out in cash from and after closing in accordance with
their existing vesting schedules (clauses (i) through (iv) collectively, the “Specified Non-Binding Terms”). The March 2 Proposal was promptly shared
with the Board.
On March 7, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also
attended the meeting. Goodwin provided an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with their evaluation of a potential transaction.
Morgan Stanley provided market, trading price and industry updates since the last such presentation on January 13, 2022, noting in particular the impacts
of inflation, the interest rate environment, global supply chain challenges, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and higher energy prices, among other
macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics that had newly arisen or been exacerbated since the January 13, 2022 presentation. The Board then discussed
the March 2 Proposal. Morgan Stanley presented an updated preliminary financial analysis based on Thoma Bravo’s $60.00 per share offer price and on
the January 2022 Projections, Company management confirmed that the January 2022 Projections had not materially changed since their approval. A
representative of Goodwin discussed certain process considerations with respect to a possible transaction with Thoma Bravo and/or its affiliates or with
other entities, including the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest with members of the Board. The Board discussed various potential
conflicts of interest or potential appearances of a conflict of interest applicable to each director (if any) in relation to (i) a potential transaction with Thoma
Bravo and (ii) Thoma Bravo and its affiliates. Specifically, it was noted that (i) Mr. McClain had investments in various funds affiliated with Thoma Bravo
which were not material to his overall net worth and not material to Thoma Bravo and its affiliates; (ii) Mr. Cam McMartin served as the audit committee
chair of a Thoma Bravo portfolio company; (iii) Mr. William Bock served as a director of two Thoma Bravo portfolio companies; (iv) Mr. Jim Pflaging
served as a director of four Thoma Bravo portfolio companies; (v) Mr. Sudhakar Ramakrishna served as the CEO and director of a Thoma Bravo portfolio
company; (vi) Ms. Tracey Newell had no known potential conflicts of interest or potential appearances of a conflict of interest; (vii) Ms. Heidi Melin had
no known potential conflicts of interest or potential appearances of a conflict of interest; (viii) Mr. Ron Green had no known potential conflicts of interest
or potential appearances of a conflict of interest; and (ix) Mr. Mike Sullivan had been appointed to the Board as an independent director by Thoma Bravo
at a time when Thoma Bravo was the controlling stockholder of the Company, but otherwise had no known potential conflicts of interest or potential
appearances of a conflict of interest. Following discussion, the Board adopted resolutions forming a special committee of the Board (the “Special
Committee” or “Committee”), consisting of directors who are independent and disinterested in relation to (i) a potential transaction with Thoma Bravo
and (ii) Thoma Bravo and its affiliates, to consider and evaluate any proposals made for a potential transaction with any counterparty as well as any
alternatives to a potential transaction, including, without limitation, the Company continuing to operate as an independent, publicly traded company. The
Board appointed Ms. Newell, Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Melin to the Special Committee (with these directors recusing themselves from the vote with respect
to certain resolutions concerning their compensation as members of the Committee). Prior to this meeting, Ms. Newell, Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Melin had
each answered questions regarding their relationships, which confirmed that each was independent and disinterested in relation to (i) a potential
transaction with Thoma Bravo and (ii) Thoma Bravo and its affiliates. The Board determined to revisit the composition of the Special Committee in the
event that the Company engaged with any other counterparty with respect to which any of the incumbent members of the Special Committee were not
independent or disinterested.
Immediately following the Board meeting on March 7, 2022, the Special Committee held its first meeting by videoconference. Members of SailPoint
management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. The Committee discussed views on valuation of the
Company and risks to the Company on a standalone basis. Following the discussion, the Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to prepare potential
alternative responses to Thoma Bravo’s $60.00 per share offer price.

Also on March 7, 2022, a member of the Special Committee received a call from a representative of a financial sponsor firm (“Financial Sponsor A”) with
whom this member of the Special Committee had an ongoing professional relationship. On the call, Financial Sponsor A requested to meet with Mr.
McClain and implied that Financial Sponsor A was interested in evaluating a potential transaction. Pending discussion with the full Special Committee,
and in light of this member’s professional relationship with Financial Sponsor A, this member of the Special Committee did not respond to Financial
Sponsor A’s request on the call.
Also on March 7, 2022, Mr. McClain had a pre-scheduled call with a representative of a financial sponsor firm (“Financial Sponsor B”) which had
historically had routine discussions with the Company without discussions regarding any specific potential transaction. This call had been scheduled to
discuss matters unrelated to a potential transaction. On the call, the representative of Financial Sponsor B asked Mr. McClain whether SailPoint has
considered engaging in a going-private transaction. Mr. McClain did not respond substantively to this question.
On March 8, 2022, Morgan Stanley sent customary relationship disclosures to Goodwin, which information was shared with the Special Committee,
disclosing certain relationships between Morgan Stanley and representatives thereof on the one hand and SailPoint and Thoma Bravo, and their
respective affiliates, on the other hand. These disclosed relationships included the fact that Morgan Stanley is a counterparty to SailPoint with respect to
certain derivative call option transactions entered into in connection with the Company’s issuance of its convertible notes due 2024, and that the public
announcement of a potential transaction may result in adjustments to such derivative transactions, which adjustments may be favorable to Morgan
Stanley.
Later on March 8, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Morgan Stanley also
attended portions of the meeting and representatives of Goodwin attended the meeting. Further to the Committee’s March 7, 2022 meeting, the Committee,
Morgan Stanley and Goodwin discussed potential alternative responses to Thoma Bravo. Following this discussion, the Committee instructed Morgan
Stanley to respond to Thoma Bravo with a message that (i) some directors on the full Board believed that the deal price should be at least $70.00 per share
and others believed that the deal price should at least be in the upper $60s per share, (ii) SailPoint was prepared to enter into a non-disclosure agreement
with Thoma Bravo and proceed expeditiously with value-critical due diligence so that Thoma Bravo could submit a revised offer, and (iii) determinations
about other procedural and legal matters including post-signing go-shop terms would be deferred pending further Committee review, but that the
Committee was not prepared to enter into a potential transaction without a pre-signing market check. Following Morgan Stanley’s departure from the
meeting, Goodwin reviewed the Morgan Stanley relationship disclosure with the Committee, and the Committee determined that Morgan Stanley should
be engaged as its financial advisor. The Committee directed Goodwin to negotiate formal terms of SailPoint’s engagement with Morgan Stanley, which
negotiations continued through to March 18, 2022. The member of the Special Committee who received the call from Financial Sponsor A on March 7,
2022 also informed the Committee about the call and, following this director’s departure from the meeting, the Committee discussed potential engagement
with Financial Sponsor A and authorized this director to respond to Financial Sponsor A and approve a meeting between Financial Sponsor A and Mr.
McClain. This director conveyed this message to Financial Sponsor A on March 8, 2022.
Later on March 8, 2022, Morgan Stanley called Thoma Bravo and conveyed the message of the Committee described above. On the call, Thoma Bravo
conveyed to Morgan Stanley that it accepted the Committee’s determination for Thoma Bravo to enter into a non-disclosure agreement, commence value-
critical due diligence and, subject to the outcomes of such due diligence, may potentially submit a revised offer price. Morgan Stanley then shared a draft
non-disclosure agreement prepared by Goodwin with Thoma Bravo and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Thoma Bravo’s outside counsel (“Kirkland”).
On March 9, 2022, Morgan Stanley received from Thoma Bravo an initial markup of the Company’s form of non-disclosure agreement, and promptly
shared these markups with Goodwin and the Company. Later on March 9, 2022, SailPoint and Thoma Bravo entered into a non-disclosure agreement that
included a standstill provision that prohibited Thoma Bravo, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the agreement, from offering
37
Table of Contents
to acquire or acquiring SailPoint, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of SailPoint (but did not
include a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision), subject to the ability of Thoma Bravo to make certain confidential proposals to the Company and
to certain customary fall-away provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry, commencement or public announcement of certain change of control
transactions involving the Company and any third party.
Also on March 9, 2022, the Company received from Thoma Bravo a list of high-priority due diligence requests.
On March 11, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin also attended the
meeting and representatives of Morgan Stanley attended portions of the meeting. Morgan Stanley reported on the March 8, 2022 call between it and
Thoma Bravo described above. The Committee also discussed Mr. McClain’s upcoming meeting with Financial Sponsor A on March 15, 2022. Later on
March 11, 2022, Morgan Stanley and Goodwin shared with Company management guidance and direction for Mr. McClain’s meeting with Financial
Sponsor A.
On March 15, 2022, Mr. McClain met by videoconference with representatives of Financial Sponsor A and discussed potential strategic partnership
opportunities or other strategic alternative opportunities between SailPoint and Financial Sponsor A.
Later on March 15 and March 16, 2022, members of SailPoint management met in-person with members of the Thoma Bravo deal team to conduct a
management presentation.
On March 17, 2022, SailPoint received a revised non-binding letter of intent from Thoma Bravo to acquire SailPoint for $62.00 per share in cash (the
“March 17 Proposal”). The $62.00 per share offer price implied a premium to SailPoint’s last closing price prior to March 17, 2022 of approximately 41%.
The Specified Non-Binding Terms remained unchanged in the March 17 Proposal. Thoma Bravo contemporaneously called Morgan Stanley and
conveyed that (i) Thoma Bravo was prepared to enter into a definitive agreement within two weeks, (ii) Thoma Bravo expected to be able to secure
financing commitments in respect of the full consideration and (iii) Thoma Bravo preferred that the Company expeditiously enter into a definitive
agreement with Thoma Bravo containing a “go-shop” and therefore avoid delays associated with a pre-signing market check. Pending discussion with
the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley did not respond substantively to these points, including the request to sign expeditiously without a pre-signing
market check, other than to note that the $62.00 per share offer price appeared to be inadequate relative to the price guidance previously conveyed to
Thoma Bravo by Morgan Stanley on March 8, 2022. The March 17 Proposal was promptly shared with the Special Committee.
On March 18, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin also attended the
meeting and representatives of Morgan Stanley attended portions of the meeting. The Committee discussed the March 17 Proposal, as well as Thoma
Bravo’s other points conveyed to Morgan Stanley, including that it preferred that the Company sign expeditiously without a pre-signing market check.
Following discussion, the Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to respond to Thoma Bravo that (i) the $62.00 per share offer price remained inadequate,
(ii) the Committee would consider an offer price in the upper $60s for a potential transaction and (iii) the Company firmly rejected any limitations on the
Company’s ability to conduct a pre-signing market check in accordance with the Committee’s sole discretion. The Committee also discussed a plan for a
pre-signing market check, and determined that if Thoma Bravo reverted with a meaningfully improved offer price, then the Company would promptly
commence a pre-signing market check at that point and would revert to Thoma Bravo with a specific counterproposal of $67.00 per share. The Committee
also discussed the timing, scope, sequencing and messaging for a potential pre-signing market check. The Committee members expressed their belief that
involving financial sponsor counterparties in the market check was riskier as compared to strategic counterparties, on account of, among other things,
their lack of strategic synergies and therefore reduced ability to compete on price and the risks of leaks due to their potentially involving co-investors or
other equity investors and debt financing sources. In light of these concerns, the Committee members discussed limiting the involvement of financial
sponsors in any pre-signing market check exclusively to those sponsors that had recently and specifically reached out to SailPoint indicating interest in a
potential transaction. Mr. McClain
38
Table of Contents
also updated the Committee on his meeting with Financial Sponsor A on March 15, 2022 and his impression that Financial Sponsor A was highly
interested in a potential transaction.
Later on March 18, 2022, Morgan Stanley called Thoma Bravo and conveyed the message of the Committee that (i) the $62.00 per share offer price
remained inadequate, (ii) the Committee would consider an offer price in the upper $60s for a potential transaction and (iii) the Company firmly rejected
any limitations on the Company’s ability to conduct a pre-signing market check in accordance with the Committee’s sole discretion.
Later on March 18, 2022, SailPoint received a revised non-binding letter of intent from Thoma Bravo to acquire SailPoint for $63.50 per share in cash (the
“March 18 Proposal”). The $63.50 per share offer price implied a premium to SailPoint’s last closing price prior to March 18, 2022 of approximately 43%.
The Specified Non-Binding Terms remained unchanged in the March 18 Proposal. The March 18 Proposal was promptly shared with the Special
Committee. In response, and in accordance with the direction of the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley responded later on March 18, 2022 with a
counterproposal of $67.00 per share.
Following negotiation between Goodwin (on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee) and Morgan Stanley, on March 18, 2022, SailPoint
also signed a formal engagement letter with Morgan Stanley in connection with a potential transaction, which engagement letter was effective as of
January 10, 2022.
On March 19, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan
Stanley also attended the meeting. The Committee discussed the March 18 Proposal and the Committee’s counterproposal with a $67.00 per share price
target, as well as strategy and potential responses from Thoma Bravo.
Later on March 19, 2022, Morgan Stanley received a call from Thoma Bravo verbally conveying that Thoma Bravo would soon submit a revised non-
binding letter of intent to acquire SailPoint for $65.25 per share in cash, which Thoma Bravo expressly characterized on the call as its “best and final” offer
(the “March 19 Verbal Proposal”). The $65.25 per share offer price implied a premium to SailPoint’s last closing price prior to (i) March 19, 2022 of
approximately 40%, (ii) March 18, 2022 of approximately 47%, (iii) March 17, 2022 of approximately 49% and (iv) March 2, 2022 of approximately 46%. On
the call, Thoma Bravo conveyed to Morgan Stanley that, in light of the significant premium represented by the $65.25 per share offer price, which
represented a premium to the Company’s all-time high trading price, Thoma Bravo was expecting that, if the Company engaged in a pre-signing market
check, that it would be limited in scope.
Promptly following the receipt of the March 19 Verbal Proposal on March 19, 2022, the Special Committee re-convened by videoconference. Members of
SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. The Committee discussed the March 19 Verbal
Proposal. The Committee reaffirmed that it would reject any limitations on the Company’s ability to conduct a pre-signing market check in accordance
with the Committee’s sole discretion. The Committee also noted that, having extensively discussed and taken into account various important
considerations pertaining to the involvement of financial sponsors in a market check, including their lack of strategic synergies and reduced ability to
compete on price and the risks of leaks due to their potential involvement of co-investors or other equity investors and debt financing sources, the
Committee had intended to limit the involvement of financial sponsors in any pre-signing market check exclusively to those sponsors that had recently
and specifically reached out to SailPoint indicating interest in a potential transaction. The Committee then discussed the timing, scope and sequencing of
the Company’s pre-signing market check, with input from Morgan Stanley, reviewing each potential strategic and financial sponsor counterparty and
determining to exclude certain strategic and financial sponsor counterparties from the market check on account of various considerations, including the
risk of leaks and competitive sensitivities, as well as each counterparty’s level of execution risk and ability to undertake an all-cash acquisition rather than
an all-stock or mixed-consideration acquisition. The Committee determined to commence the market check on March 21, 2022 with respect to strategic
counterparties, with financial sponsor counterparties to follow later that week on account of the risks previously addressed.

Later on March 19, 2022, following the Special Committee meeting, SailPoint received a revised non-binding letter of intent from Thoma Bravo
memorializing the $65.25 Verbal Proposal to acquire SailPoint for $65.25 per share in cash, which was expressly characterized in the letter of intent as
Thoma Bravo’s “best and final” offer (such letter, together with the March 19 Verbal Proposal, the “March 19 Final Proposal”). The Specified Non-Binding
Terms remained unchanged in the March 19 Final Proposal. This letter of intent was promptly shared with the Special Committee. Later on March 19, 2022,
Morgan Stanley called Thoma Bravo and (i) conveyed that the Board would meet on March 20, 2022 to discuss the March 19 Final Proposal, (ii)
discussed certain valuation assumptions underlying the March 19 Final Proposal and the letters of intent preceding it and (iii) reiterated the message of
the Committee that the Company firmly rejected any limitations on the Company’s ability to conduct a pre-signing market check in accordance with the
Committee’s sole discretion.
On March 20, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin also attended the meeting and
representatives of Morgan Stanley attended portions of the meeting. Morgan Stanley provided a detailed overview of the recent developments with
Thoma Bravo, including those that occurred on March 19, 2022. The Board discussed the March 19 Final Proposal, including Thoma Bravo’s “best and
final” $65.25 per share offer price, Thoma Bravo’s views on any pre-signing market check and the Committee’s view on preserving the Company’s
discretion as to any pre-signing market check. Goodwin also discussed the status of negotiations of a definitive agreement with Kirkland, including
relating to a post-signing go-shop and the status of Thoma Bravo’s due diligence. Members of the Special Committee gave their preliminary view that, in
light of Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the Company’s inherent valuation, the negotiation history with Thoma Bravo thus far and other important
considerations, and subject in all respects to the outcomes of the Company’s pre-signing market check, the Committee regarded the $65.25 per share offer
price to be a compelling offer price. Members of the Committee then reported on its determinations regarding the timing, scope and sequencing of the
Company’s pre-signing market check, and other members of the Board expressed their views on the Committee’s determinations. Members of the Board
also inquired of the Committee whether it had considered simply rejecting the $65.25 per share offer price on the basis that Morgan Stanley had made a
counterproposal of $67.00 per share to Thoma Bravo. Members of the Committee responded in the affirmative that they had considered rejecting the
$65.25 per share offer price, but after discussion, they had regarded it to be a compelling offer price.
Also on March 20, 2022, Thoma Bravo announced its entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Anaplan, Inc. for approximately $11 billion.
On March 21, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management also attended portions of the meeting and
representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley reported that Thoma Bravo intended to raise approximately $1
billion in debt financing for the potential transaction. The Special Committee then considered, along with representatives of Goodwin, how Thoma
Bravo’s debt financing would impact the Company’s remedies under a definitive agreement. Following discussion, the Committee authorized Morgan
Stanley to approve Thoma Bravo’s request to involve two lender partners for its debt financing syndicate. The Committee then discussed Thoma Bravo’s
entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Anaplan, Inc. Representatives of Goodwin reviewed ongoing due diligence, including a request by Thoma
Bravo that representatives of Thoma Bravo meet in-person with Mr. McClain, and certain terms under negotiation in the draft definitive agreement,
including relating to a post-signing go-shop and termination fees.
Also on March 21, 2022, Morgan Stanley commenced the Company’s pre-signing market check with respect to strategic counterparties in accordance
with the directions of the Board and the Special Committee, including that the market check with respect to previously interested financial sponsors
should follow later on account of the risks pertaining to financial sponsors addressed by the Board and the Committee. Morgan Stanley reached out to
six strategic counterparties (referred to herein as “Strategic Party A”, “Strategic Party B”, “Strategic Party C”, “Strategic Party D”, “Strategic Party E” and
“Strategic Party F”), in each case with the message that the Company had received a proposal to acquire the Company with low execution risk, and that
the Company was
40
Table of Contents
prepared to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the counterparty to enable the counterparty to expeditiously receive access to due diligence and
potentially submit a proposal for a potential transaction.
Later on March 23, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan
Stanley also attended the meeting. Representatives of Goodwin provided an update on the negotiation of go-shop terms with Kirkland. Morgan Stanley
then provided a status update on the ongoing market check, noting that no strategic party thus far had requested to enter into a non-disclosure
agreement. The Committee then discussed the scope and sequencing of the Company’s market check with respect to financial sponsor counterparties,
reviewing each potential financial sponsor counterparty. The Committee also authorized Morgan Stanley to approve Thoma Bravo’s request to involve a
third lender partner for its debt financing syndicate, and determined that, subject to the Committee’s review of each particular debt financing source, the
Committee would also generally permit other market check participants to involve debt financing sources if so requested.
On March 24, 2022, Morgan Stanley and Thoma Bravo had a call wherein Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the Committee described above, approved
Thoma Bravo’s request to involve another lender partner for its debt financing syndicate.
Also on March 24, 2022, Morgan Stanley received an update from Strategic Party A that they would like to learn more about SailPoint, and were
continuing to evaluate a potential transaction internally. Strategic Party A did not request to enter into a non-disclosure agreement at this time.
Also on March 24, 2022, Morgan Stanley was notified by Strategic Party B that Strategic Party B was affirmatively declining to further evaluate a potential
transaction.
On March 25, 2022, Morgan Stanley received an unsolicited email from a representative of a financial sponsor firm (“Financial Sponsor C”) expressing
interest in evaluating a potential transaction.
Also on March 25, 2022, Morgan Stanley commenced the Company’s pre-signing market check with respect to financial sponsor counterparties in
accordance with the directions of the Board and the Special Committee. Morgan Stanley reached out to Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B,
each of which had recently and specifically indicated interest to the Company in evaluating a potential transaction, and in each case with the message
that the Company had received a proposal to acquire the Company with low execution risk, and that the Company was prepared to enter into a non-
disclosure agreement with the counterparty to enable the counterparty to expeditiously receive access to due diligence and potentially submit a proposal
for a potential transaction.
Later on March 25, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management also attended portions of the meeting and
representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley provided a status update on the ongoing market check. Morgan
Stanley also reported on the unsolicited indication of interest received from Financial Sponsor C described above, and following discussion, the
Committee authorized Morgan Stanley to include Financial Sponsor C in the market check. Morgan Stanley also reported on Thoma Bravo having
expressed a strong desire to enter into a definitive agreement immediately after its investment committee meeting scheduled for April 6, 2022, as described
above. The Committee expressed its desire to continue to work expeditiously with Thoma Bravo, but determined not to commit to any specific timetable in
light of the ongoing market check.
Also on March 25, 2022, Morgan Stanley received from each of Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B an initial markup of the Company’s form of
non-disclosure agreement, and promptly shared these markups with Goodwin and the Company.
On March 27, 2022, Morgan Stanley spoke to Financial Sponsor C as part of the market check in accordance with the directions of the Special Committee,
with the message that the Company had received a proposal to
41
Table of Contents
acquire the Company with low execution risk, and that the Company was prepared to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Financial Sponsor C to
enable it to expeditiously receive access to due diligence and potentially submit a proposal for a potential transaction
Also on March 27, 2022, SailPoint and Financial Sponsor A entered into a non-disclosure agreement that included a standstill provision that prohibited
Financial Sponsor A, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the agreement, from offering to acquire or acquiring SailPoint, and from taking certain
other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of SailPoint (but did not include a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision),
subject to the ability of Financial Sponsor A to make certain confidential proposals to the Company and to certain customary fall-away provisions to the
standstill in the event of the entry, commencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the Company and any
third party.
Also on March 27, 2022, Morgan Stanley received an unsolicited communication from a financial sponsor firm (“Financial Sponsor D”) regarding
SailPoint. Morgan Stanley subsequently spoke with Financial Sponsor D, but Financial Sponsor D did not indicate an interest in a potential transaction
with SailPoint.
Also on March 27, 2022, Goodwin received from Kirkland an initial draft of the merger agreement for a potential transaction with Thoma Bravo, which
included a go-shop provision.
On March 28, 2022, the Board met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also
attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley reported on the unsolicited communication received from Financial Sponsor D described above. Due to upward
movements in SailPoint’s trading price in recent days coupled with the unsolicited communications received from Financial Sponsor C and Financial
Sponsor D, the Board expressed concerned that the Company’s ongoing sale process had leaked to an unknown extent.
Also on March 28, 2022, Morgan Stanley received confirmation from Financial Sponsor A that it would attend a management presentation with the
Company on March 30, 2022.
On March 29, 2022, SailPoint and Financial Sponsor B entered into a non-disclosure agreement that included a standstill provision that prohibited
Financial Sponsor B, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the agreement, from offering to acquire or acquiring SailPoint, and from taking certain
other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of SailPoint (but did not include a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision),
subject to the ability of Financial Sponsor B to make certain confidential proposals to the Company and to certain customary fall-away provisions to the
standstill in the event of the entry, commencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the Company and any
third party.
Also on March 29, 2022, Morgan Stanley received from Financial Sponsor C an initial markup of the Company’s form of non-disclosure agreement, and
promptly shared this markup with Goodwin and the Company. Later on March 29, 2022, SailPoint and Financial Sponsor C entered into a non-disclosure
agreement that included a standstill provision that prohibited Financial Sponsor C, for an agreed-upon period from the date of the agreement, from
offering to acquire or acquiring SailPoint, and from taking certain other actions, including soliciting proxies, without the prior consent of SailPoint (but did
not include a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision), subject to the ability of Financial Sponsor C to make certain confidential proposals to the
Company and to certain customary fall-away provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry, commencement or public announcement of certain
change of control transactions involving the Company and any third party. Morgan Stanley also received confirmation from Financial Sponsor C that it
would attend a management presentation with the Company on April 1, 2022.
Also on March 29, 2022, Morgan Stanley had a call with Strategic Party A. Strategic Party A expressed interest in having a management meeting with the
Company to learn more about the Company and its business. Strategic
42
Table of Contents
Party A shared with Morgan Stanley a draft non-disclosure agreement prepared by Strategic Party A, which did not include a standstill provision. Later
on March 29, 2022, following review by Goodwin, Morgan Stanley reverted with a revised draft of this non-disclosure agreement which, among other
things, added a standstill provision (but not a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision), which was made subject to the ability of Strategic Party A to
make certain confidential proposals to the Company and to certain customary fall-away provisions to the standstill in the event of the entry,
commencement or public announcement of certain change of control transactions involving the Company and any third party.
Also on March 29, 2022, Morgan Stanley was notified by Strategic Party F that Strategic Party F was affirmatively declining to further evaluate a potential
transaction.
On March 30, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin also attended the
meeting and representatives of Morgan Stanley attended portions of the meeting. Morgan Stanley reported that, in accordance with the direction of the
Special Committee, it had conveyed to each of Financial Sponsor A, Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C that the Company expected to receive
their preliminary proposals for a potential transaction by April 4, 2022. The Committee also discussed its continued monitoring of SailPoint’s trading price,
which had continued to rise in recent days. Representatives of Goodwin also presented an overview of certain terms in the draft definitive agreement
being negotiated with Kirkland with respect to employee and equity award matters. Representatives of Goodwin then presented an overview of other
material legal issues in the draft definitive agreement.
Also on March 30, 2022, SailPoint management provided a revised set of the January 2022 Projections to Morgan Stanley, updated to reflect SailPoint’s
actual full year and fourth quarter 2021 financial results (as so updated, the “Projections”).
Also on March 30, 2022, members of SailPoint management and representatives of Morgan Stanley conducted a management presentation for Financial
Sponsor A. Morgan Stanley also granted access to the Company’s virtual data room to Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor B.
Also on March 30, 2022, Morgan Stanley was notified by Strategic Party D that Strategic Party D was affirmatively declining to further evaluate a
potential transaction.
On March 31, 2022, members of SailPoint management and representatives of Morgan Stanley conducted a management presentation for Financial
Sponsor B.
Also on March 31, 2022, Morgan Stanley followed up with Strategic Party A regarding the revised non-disclosure agreement that it had sent back to
Strategic Party A on March 29, 2022. Strategic Party A pushed back on including a standstill provision, among other things, in the non-disclosure
agreement, and cited institutional concerns over the lack of an ability to properly enforce such a standstill provision across Strategic Party A’s numerous
business units.
Also on March 31, 2022, Morgan Stanley was notified by Strategic Party C that Strategic Party C will most likely decline to further evaluate a potential
transaction, and to assume that Strategic Party C would so decline.
On April 1, 2022, members of SailPoint management and representatives of Morgan Stanley conducted a management presentation for Financial Sponsor
C.
Also on April 1, 2022, Morgan Stanley had a call with Financial Sponsor A. On the call, Financial Sponsor A conveyed to Morgan Stanley that, if it were
to make a proposal, then the offer price would likely be in the range of $60.00 to $65.00 per share and that the price would likely be at the low end of that
range and would not in any circumstances exceed that range. In any event, Financial Sponsor A conveyed that it would likely require further due
diligence on the timespan of multiple weeks before making any such proposal.

Later on April 1, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan
Stanley also attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley provided a status update on the ongoing market check. The Committee reviewed with the
representatives of Goodwin Strategic Party A’s pushback on including a standstill provision in its non-disclosure agreement. The Committee authorized
Goodwin to forego a standstill provision for the time being in order to enable Strategic Party A to expeditiously gain access to value-critical due diligence
and potentially make a preliminary proposal for a potential transaction, which the Committee viewed to be a worthwhile compromise given the fact that
any such standstill would likely be expected to fall away if SailPoint were to publicly announce a potential transaction. After Morgan Stanley conveyed
this concession to Strategic Party A, SailPoint and Strategic Party A entered into a non-disclosure agreement on April 4, 2022, which did not include a
standstill provision. A management meeting with Strategic Party A was scheduled, to occur on April 7, 2022. At the April 1, 2022 meeting, Morgan Stanley
also reported on its call with Financial Sponsor A earlier on April 1, 2022 as described above. In light of Financial Sponsor A’s messaging, the Committee
determined to terminate the Company’s engagement with Financial Sponsor A following the preliminary proposal deadline on April 4, 2022, and therefore
that the Committee member who had an ongoing professional relationship with Financial Sponsor A could continue to serve on the Committee.
Representatives of Goodwin then presented an overview of the material legal terms in the draft definitive agreement with Thoma Bravo. This included
Thoma Bravo’s agreement that SailPoint would have a post-signing go-shop lasting 35 days, and would be entitled to terminate the definitive agreement
with Thoma Bravo within 45 days after signing to enter into a superior proposal received from an “excluded party” during the go-shop for a reduced
termination fee payable by the Company.
On April 2, 2022, Morgan Stanley followed up with each of Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C, reiterating to each party that if they were
interested in submitting a proposal for a potential transaction, they must notify Morgan Stanley of their proposal by mid-day on April 4, 2022. On the call
with Morgan Stanley, Financial Sponsor B reported that the same representatives of Financial Sponsor B evaluating a potential transaction with the
Company were separately engaged in evaluating a merger and acquisition opportunity involving a different company, that these separate obligations
would likely lead to significant delays in Financial Sponsor B’s ability to evaluate a potential transaction with the Company and that Financial Sponsor B
was not prepared to estimate on a preliminary basis its ultimate valuation of the Company, if it were to eventually make a proposal at all.
On April 4, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley
also attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley reported on its calls with Financial Sponsor B and Financial Sponsor C as described above. Morgan Stanley
also presented an updated financial and premia analysis on the basis of Thoma Bravo’s $65.25 per share offer price.
Also on April 4, 2022, Morgan Stanley again followed up with Financial Sponsor C. Financial Sponsor C reported that its representatives were
simultaneously evaluating another merger and acquisition opportunity involving a different company, that these separate obligations would likely lead to
significant delays in Financial Sponsor C’s ability to evaluate a potential transaction with the Company and that Financial Sponsor C was not prepared to
estimate on a preliminary basis its ultimate valuation of the Company, if it were to eventually make a proposal at all.
Also on April 4, 2022, Mr. McClain and representatives of Thoma Bravo met in-person and discussed Thoma Bravo’s remaining high-level due diligence
items.
On April 5, 2022, Morgan Stanley had a call with Thoma Bravo. Morgan Stanley conveyed that the Special Committee did not believe that the Company
would be prepared to enter into a definitive agreement on April 6, 2022, as Thoma Bravo had desired, but that the Company may potentially be prepared
to enter into a definitive agreement sometime during the coming weekend on April 9 or 10, 2022.
Later on April 5, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan
Stanley also attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley reported on its call earlier on April 5, 2022 with Thoma Bravo as described above. The Committee
resolved to hold a management
44

meeting with Strategic Party A on April 7, 2022 as planned, with the hope of being able to receive a preliminary proposal for a potential transaction from
Strategic Party A shortly thereafter and prior to determining whether to proceed with entering into a definitive agreement with Thoma Bravo.
On April 6, 2022, Morgan Stanley was notified by Financial Party B that Financial Party B was affirmatively declining to further evaluate a potential
transaction, due to its prioritization of time and resources to a separate transaction.
Also on April 6, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management also attended portions of the meeting and
representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. Mr. McClain presented a preliminary overview of SailPoint’s actual first
quarter 2022 financial results, which in the aggregate were consistent with expectations despite various strengths and weaknesses across different
geographic regions. Morgan Stanley also gave an update on the market check, noting that Financial Party B had affirmatively declined to further evaluate
a potential transaction.
Also on April 6, 2022, members of SailPoint management met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to provide a preliminary overview of SailPoint’s actual

geographic regions.
Also on April 6, 2022, Morgan Stanley was notified by Strategic Party E that Strategic Party E was affirmatively declining to further evaluate a potential
transaction, due to the fact that the Company’s lines of business were not currently priorities for Strategic Party E.
On April 7, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley
also attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley presented an updated financial and premia analysis on the basis of Thoma Bravo’s $65.25 per share offer
price. Goodwin also presented an overview of material legal terms in the draft definitive agreement with Thoma Bravo.

transaction.
Over the course of April 8, 9 and 10, Goodwin and Kirkland finalized their work on the terms of the definitive agreement between SailPoint and Thoma
Bravo, as well as the disclosure schedules and other ancillary agreements pertaining to the transaction.
On April 10, 2022, the Special Committee met by videoconference to review the final terms of the definitive agreement between SailPoint and Thoma Bravo
and related ancillary agreements and vote on whether to recommend entry into such definitive agreement to the Board. Members of SailPoint management
and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley presented an update on the Company’s market check,
noting that the market check had yielded one verbal preliminary price proposal to acquire the Company, which was the verbal indication conveyed by
Financial Sponsor A on April 1, 2022. Morgan Stanley also discussed the intended scope and sequencing of the Company’s go-shop process which,
assuming that the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Thoma Bravo on April 10, 2022, would commence on April 11, 2022 and run through
to May 16, 2022. Morgan Stanley presented a list of 44 potential go-shop counterparties consisting of 20 strategic counterparties and 24 financial
sponsor counterparties. Among these, the Committee determined to exclude specifically reaching out to three strategic counterparties as part of the go-
shop, on account of various considerations, including these counterparties’ financial capacity, commercial and competitive sensitivity and enterprise size
relative to SailPoint. Representatives of Goodwin then presented an overview of the final material legal terms in the definitive agreement with Thoma
Bravo, as well as ancillary agreements pertaining to the potential transaction with Thoma Bravo including Thoma Bravo’s equity commitment letter, debt
commitment letter and limited guaranty. Morgan Stanley then reported to the Committee
45
Table of Contents
that it would be prepared to deliver its oral fairness opinion to the Board at the Board meeting that would immediately follow this Committee meeting,
which would subsequently be confirmed in writing, and which would state that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the
written opinion, the per share merger consideration to be received by SailPoint’s stockholders (other than holders of certain excluded shares) pursuant to
the definitive agreement with Thoma Bravo was fair, from a financial point of view, to such SailPoint stockholders. The Committee then discussed its
reasons in favor of recommending the potential transaction with Thoma Bravo to the Board, as well as considerations of risk pertaining to the same. The
Committee then unanimously adopted resolutions favorably recommending the potential transaction with Thoma Bravo to the Board.
Immediately following the Special Committee meeting, on April 10, 2022, the Board met by videoconference to review the final terms of the definitive
agreement between SailPoint and Thoma Bravo and related ancillary agreements and vote on whether to approve entry into the definitive agreement with
Thoma Bravo. Members of SailPoint management and representatives of Goodwin and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. Morgan Stanley
presented an update on the Company’s market check, noting that the market check had yielded one verbal preliminary price proposal to acquire the
Company, which was the verbal indication conveyed by Financial Sponsor A on April 1, 2022. Morgan Stanley then presented an updated financial and
premia analysis on the basis of Thoma Bravo’s final $65.25 per share offer price. Goodwin then presented an overview of the final material legal terms in
the definitive agreement with Thoma Bravo, as well as ancillary agreements pertaining to the potential transaction with Thoma Bravo including Thoma
Bravo’s equity commitment letter, debt commitment letter and limited guaranty. These terms included Thoma Bravo’s agreement that SailPoint would have
a post-signing go-shop lasting 35 days, and would be entitled to terminate the definitive agreement with Thoma Bravo within 45 days after signing to
enter into a superior proposal received from an “excluded party” during the go-shop for a reduced termination fee payable by the Company. Morgan
Stanley then summarized the updated Morgan Stanley Relationship Disclosure, which included the fact that Morgan Stanley is a counterparty to
SailPoint with respect to certain derivative call option transactions entered into in connection with the Company’s issuance of its convertible notes due
2024, and that the public announcement of a potential transaction may result in adjustments to such derivative transactions, which adjustments may be
favorable to Morgan Stanley. A representative of Morgan Stanley then delivered Morgan Stanley’s oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing,
dated April 10, 2022, to the Board of Directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the $65.25 per
share in cash to be received by holders of shares of SailPoint common stock (other than holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such SailPoint Stockholders. Members of the Special Committee then reported on the Committee’s
reasons in favor of recommending the potential transaction with Thoma Bravo to the Board, as well as considerations of risk pertaining to the same. After
extensive discussions of the proposed potential transaction with Thoma Bravo and the matters summarized for the Board at the meeting, the Board then
unanimously (i) determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger
agreement with Thoma Bravo, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement with Thoma Bravo and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) recommended that the Company stockholders adopt the merger agreement with Thoma Bravo and
directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the Company stockholders at a special meeting of Company stockholders.
Later in the evening on April 10, 2022, SailPoint and Thoma Bravo executed and delivered the merger agreement and the limited guaranty, and Thoma
Bravo and the other parties thereto executed and delivered the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letter.
Early in the morning on April 11, 2022, the parties issued a press release publicly announcing the transaction.

Financial Sponsor E entered into a non-disclosure agreement.

the Company. Later on April 25, 2022, SailPoint and Financial Sponsor F entered into a non-disclosure agreement.
On April 27, 2022, Morgan Stanley was notified by Financial Sponsor E that Financial Sponsor E was affirmatively declining to further evaluate a potential

Sponsor F and Financial Sponsor G.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board and the Special Committee carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with SailPoint’s management and legal
and financial advisors and, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, the Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests
of SailPoint and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance
of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that
SailPoint Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for the consideration of SailPoint Stockholders at the
Special Meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis,
the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
The Board and the Special Committee carefully reviewed and considered the proposed Merger in consultation with SailPoint’s management and legal and
financial advisors and, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of SailPoint and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, and (iii) recommended that SailPoint
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for the consideration of SailPoint stockholders at a special meeting
of SailPoint stockholders.
In reaching these decisions, the Board and the Special Committee considered the following positive reasons to support the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby:
•
the fact that the price of $65.25 per share in cash payable in the Merger provides certainty, immediate value and liquidity to SailPoint
stockholders;
•
the historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of SailPoint common stock, including the fact that
$65.25 per share to be received by SailPoint stockholders in the Merger represents a premium of approximately 32% over the closing price of
SailPoint common stock as of April 8, 2022, the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger, a premium of approximately
48% over the 90-day volume-weighted average price of SailPoint common stock as of April 8, 2022, a premium of approximately 36% over the
30-day average of SailPoint common stock as of April 8, 2022, and a premium of approximately 3% over the all-time high price of SailPoint
common stock as of April 8, 2022;
•
the current and prospective business environment in which SailPoint operates, including international, national and local economic
conditions, the competitive environment, and the likely effect of these factors on SailPoint and the execution of SailPoint’s plans as a
standalone company;
•
the belief that the $65.25 per share in cash payable in the Merger was more favorable to SailPoint stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than
the potential value that might result from other alternatives
48Table of Contents
reasonably available to SailPoint, based upon the directors’ extensive knowledge of SailPoint’s business, assets, financial condition and
results of operations, the execution challenges that SailPoint potentially faces, SailPoint’s historical and projected financial performance,
and market dynamics, and the belief that the Merger represented an attractive and comparatively certain value for SailPoint stockholders
relative to the risk-adjusted prospects for SailPoint on a standalone basis;
•
the sale process conducted by SailPoint, with the assistance of Morgan Stanley and Goodwin, to review other potential strategic
alternatives and, in connection therewith, the engagement with multiple counterparties, including both strategic parties and financial
sponsors, regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of SailPoint;
•
the potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Thoma Bravo in the event SailPoint sought to pursue discussions with all third
parties who may be interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with SailPoint prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential
negative effect that such a process might have on SailPoint’s business, especially in light of the go-shop provision Thoma Bravo was
willing to provide that would allow for SailPoint to solicit Alternative Acquisition Proposals following announcement of the Merger;
•
the right of SailPoint, pursuant to a go-shop period ending May 16, 2022, to solicit Alternative Acquisition Proposals from, and participate
in discussions and negotiations with, third parties regarding Alternative Acquisition Proposals;
•
the belief that, after multiple rounds of negotiations with Thoma Bravo and its representatives (as described in more detail under the section
of this proxy statement captioned “—Background of the Merger”), $65.25 per share was the highest price that Thoma Bravo was willing to
pay as of the date of execution of the Merger Agreement and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to
SailPoint, in the aggregate, to which Thoma Bravo was willing to agree;
•
the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board of Directors, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of April 10, 2022, and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope
of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the $65.25 per share in cash to be received by holders of shares of SailPoint
common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such SailPoint Stockholders, as more fully described below under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC,” which full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement in its entirety;
•
the fact that SailPoint has sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course prior to the consummation of the
Merger;
•
the high degree of confidence that the Merger would close in a timely manner in light of the conditions and other terms set forth in the
Merger Agreement;
•
the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are limited in number and scope, and which, in the case of the
condition related to the accuracy of SailPoint’s representations and warranties, is generally subject to a Company Material Adverse Effect
(as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Representations and
Warranties”) qualification;
•
the ability of the Special Committee and the Board to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in certain
circumstances, to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal upon payment of a termination fee of $212,540,000 (which
the Special Committee and the Board believed was reasonable under the circumstances) and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a
Superior Proposal received prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 26, 2022 to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal received from certain parties upon payment of a reduced termination fee equal to $81,750,000;
•
the End Date of October 10, 2022 (subject to extension under certain circumstances), which is expected to allow for sufficient time to
complete the Merger;

•
the availability of statutory appraisal rights to SailPoint stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL;
•
the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement, the obligations of Parent under the Merger Agreement to arrange and
consummate the financing, and the limited number and nature of the conditions in the Financing Letters;
•
SailPoint’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter, to specifically enforce
Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment
Letter;
•
the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain circumstances, Parent will pay SailPoint a
termination fee of $425,090,000, and the obligations of the Thoma Bravo Fund under the Guaranty to fund such amount;
•
representations by Parent in the Merger Agreement that it will have adequate resources to pay the merger consideration and other amounts
required to consummate the Merger, taking into account the proceeds from the Financing Letters and the projected cash balance of
SailPoint;
•
SailPoint’s rights to specific performance under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and
•
the likelihood that the Merger would be consummated, in light of the experience, reputation and financial capabilities of Thoma Bravo and
its debt financing sources.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board and the Special Committee also considered, among other things, the following negative factors:
•
the fact that SailPoint stockholders will not participate in any future growth potential or benefit from any future increase in the value of
SailPoint as a private company;
•
the possibility that the Merger will not be consummated and the potential negative effects on SailPoint’s business, operations, financial
results and stock price;
•
the potential negative effects of the public announcement of the Merger on SailPoint’s sales, operating results and stock price, its ability to
retain key management, sales, engineering and other personnel, and its relationships with customers, suppliers and partners;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of SailPoint’s business prior to the completion of the Merger, requiring SailPoint to conduct its business in
the ordinary course and preventing SailPoint from taking certain specified actions, subject to specific limitations and exceptions, all of which
may delay or prevent SailPoint from undertaking business opportunities pending completion of the Merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger (many of which are
payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time and effort of SailPoint management required to complete the
Merger, which may disrupt SailPoint’s business operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;
•
the conditions to the obligations of Parent to complete the Merger and the right of Parent to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain
circumstances;
•
the fact that the Merger Agreement precludes SailPoint from actively soliciting Alternative Acquisition Proposals after the Go-Shop Period,
and the possibility that SailPoint may be obligated to pay Parent a termination fee of $212,540,000 or $81,750,000 in the event that SailPoint
terminates the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;
•
if Parent fails to complete the Merger as a result of the failure to obtain the financing under the Debt Commitment Letter or a breach of the
Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, remedies are generally limited to the Parent termination fee payable by Parent as described
above, which may be inadequate to compensate SailPoint for the damage caused, and if available, other rights and remedies may be
expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain;
50
Table of Contents
•
the fact that Parent requires significant third-party debt financing for the Merger and in the event that the Lenders do not provide the
financing under the Debt Commitment Letter, SailPoint will not be able to specifically enforce Parent’s obligations to complete the Merger
and may only be entitled to receive the Parent termination fee as provided under the Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that completion of the Merger requires certain regulatory clearances and consents, including under applicable antitrust laws and
certain foreign investment laws;
•
the possible loss of key management or other personnel of SailPoint during the pendency of the Merger;
•
the risk of litigation;
•
the fact that the consideration consists of cash and will therefore be taxable to SailPoint stockholders who are subject to taxation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; and
•
the interests that certain SailPoint directors and executive officers may have with respect to the Merger, in addition to their interests as
SailPoint stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers
and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger.”
The foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement is not meant to be exhaustive but addresses the material
information and factors considered by the Board and the Special Committee in consideration of their respective recommendations. In view of the wide
variety of factors considered by the Board and the Special Committee in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters,
the Board and the Special Committee did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching their respective determinations and recommendations. Rather, in considering the information and factors described above,
individual members of the Board or the Special Committee each applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given
differing weights to differing factors. The Board and the Special Committee based their respective unanimous recommendations on the totality of the
information presented. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in
conjunction with the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”

The Board of Directors retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with the possible sale
of SailPoint. The Board of Directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and
reputation, its extensive expertise and experience advising software companies in connection with potential strategic transactions (including but not
limited to numerous transactions with Thoma Bravo), its knowledge of SailPoint’s business and affairs based on its longstanding relationship with
SailPoint. At the meeting of the Board of Directors on April 10, 2022, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that,
as of April 10, 2022, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on
the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the $65.25 per share in cash to be received by holders of shares of
SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such
SailPoint Stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of April 10, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its
opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The summary of the
opinion of Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read
Morgan Stanley’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the Board of Directors, in its capacity as
51Table of Contents
such, and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the $65.25 per share in cash to be received by holders of shares of SailPoint
common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not address the
relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives
could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how SailPoint Stockholders
should vote at the Special Meeting. The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the opinion.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of SailPoint;
•
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning SailPoint;
•
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of SailPoint and certain extrapolations prepared with guidance from the
management of SailPoint (which were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by the management of SailPoint);
•
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of SailPoint with senior executives of SailPoint;
•
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for SailPoint common stock;
•
compared the financial performance of SailPoint and the prices and trading activity of SailPoint common stock with that of certain other
publicly traded companies comparable with SailPoint, and their securities;
•
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
•
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of SailPoint, Parent and their respective financial and legal
advisors;
•
reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated as of April 10, 2022, drafts of each of the Financing Letters, each dated as of April 10, 2022
and certain related documents; and
•
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by SailPoint, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With
respect to the Projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of SailPoint’s management of the future financial performance of SailPoint. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such Projections or
the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms
set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among other things, that Parent will
obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letters, and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any
material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary
governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be
imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a
legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification,

the assessment of SailPoint and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not
address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such
alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of SailPoint’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the $65.25 per share in cash to be received
by holders of shares of SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the Merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any
independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of SailPoint, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to Morgan Stanley as of, April 10, 2022. Events occurring after April 10, 2022 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing
it, and Morgan Stanley has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion letter dated as of April 10, 2022, to the Board of Directors. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s
opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses
described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below
must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.

to rely upon, among other matters, (i) the Projections and (ii) certain estimates of equity research analysts (the “Street Consensus”). The Projections are
more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Projections.” In accordance with direction from the Board of Directors,
Morgan Stanley utilized the Street Consensus and the Projections in its financial analyses described below.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar
companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for SailPoint with comparable publicly available
consensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share similar
business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue
growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the “comparable
companies”).
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue, which, for purposes of this analysis, (1) for
SailPoint, (a) was provided to Morgan Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use, by SailPoint management for calendar years 2022 and 2023 for the
Projections, and (b) was based on available consensus equity analyst research estimates for calendar years 2022 and 2023 for the Street Consensus; and
(2) for each of the comparable companies, was based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes. For
purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined “aggregate value” as a company’s fully diluted equity value plus total debt, less cash and cash
equivalents.

For calendar year 2022, the range of observed multiples of the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue for the comparable companies was 7.3x to
13.4x, with a median observed multiple of 10.5x. For calendar year 2023, the range of observed multiples of the ratio of aggregate value to estimated
revenue for the comparable companies was 6.0x to 10.0x, with a median observed multiple of 8.7x. The following is a list of the selected comparable

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,
Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples for use with each of the Projections and the Street
Consensus, respectively. Morgan Stanley then applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant revenue metric for SailPoint. For purposes of
this analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized publicly available financial information, available as of April 8, 2022 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of
the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger).
Based on the outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock on a fully diluted basis and latest cash and debt balance as provided by SailPoint
management, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of SailPoint common stock as follows:

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to SailPoint. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond SailPoint’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on SailPoint’s business and the industry
generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of SailPoint and the industry, and in
the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using
comparable company data.

Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a company
as a function of such company’s estimated future revenue. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied
present value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of the SailPoint common
stock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Consensus and Projections.
To calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2024 revenue estimates under each of the Street
Consensus and Projections, respectively. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a forward
range of aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples (based on the range of aggregate value to revenue multiples for the comparable companies) to
these revenue estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future-implied fully diluted aggregate value. For each of the Street Consensus and Projections,
Morgan Stanley applied an aggregate value to estimated revenue multiple of 8.0x to 10.0x to generate an undiscounted, implied future fully diluted equity
value.
In each case, Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future fully diluted equity value to April 8, 2022, at a discount rate of 9.8%, which rate
was selected by Morgan Stanley based on SailPoint’s estimated cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6%
market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 2.7% based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of April 8, 2022, and a 1.2 predicted beta per Barra. The result of
these analyses are listed below:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present value
of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for the
SailPoint common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value SailPoint as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the
Projections for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (burdened by stock based compensation), less taxes and capital expenditures, and adjusted for changes in net working
capital. The Projections included extrapolations through calendar year 2036 prepared by Morgan Stanley with the guidance of SailPoint management
(which extrapolations were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by SailPoint management). The free cash flows and terminal values were
discounted to present values as of April 8, 2022, at a discount rate ranging from 8.6% to 10.5%, which discount rates were selected, upon the application
of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of SailPoint’s weighted average cost of capital estimated using the
capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6% market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 2.7% based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of April 8,
2022, and a 1.2 predicted beta per Barra. To calculate terminal values, Morgan Stanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent as part
of its analyses, with such rates selected upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value
was then adjusted for net debt and further adjusted to add the net present value of net operating losses.

Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly available
financial terms. Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for selected software transactions. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable
transactions based on its professional judgment and experience, including because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, most notably
because they were similar software transactions since 2018. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value of the
transaction to the estimated next 12 months’ (referred to as “NTM”) revenue based on publicly available information at the time of announcement or at
the unaffected date of each such transaction.

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to SailPoint or the Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions,
Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond SailPoint’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on SailPoint’s
business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of
SailPoint and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value
and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of
SailPoint derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the $65.25 per share in cash to be received by holders of
shares of SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) is not necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s
analysis of the consideration for the Merger, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but which
were noted as reference data for the Board of Directors, including the following information described under the sections of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC—Illustrative Precedent Premiums,” “The Merger—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.
LLC—Historical Trading Ranges” and “The Merger—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC—Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.”
Illustrative Precedent Premiums
Morgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent transaction premiums analysis by reviewing software company transactions larger than $1 billion in
aggregate value since 2014. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (1) the
implied premium to the acquired company’s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the last full trading day prior to the
share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); and (2) the implied premium to the acquired company’s 52-week high
closing share price prior to announcement.
Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley
selected (1) a representative range of premia and applied such range to
57
Table of Contents
SailPoint’s closing share price on April 8, 2022 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger) and (2) a
representative range of premia and applied such range to SailPoint’s 52-week high closing share price:

prices of the SailPoint common stock for various periods ending on April 8, 2022 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger). Morgan Stanley observed the following:

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for SailPoint common stock prepared and published by equity research analysts
prior to April 8, 2022 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the
advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger). These targets reflected each analyst’s
estimate of the future public market trading price of SailPoint common stock. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for the SailPoint common
stock was $45 to $70 per share as of various dates ranging from November 10, 2021 to April 4, 2022. Morgan Stanley then took the 25th – 75th percentile
which was $60—$63 per share and discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for the SailPoint common stock by one year at a rate of 9.8%,
which was the discount rate selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to reflect SailPoint’s cost of
equity, estimated using the CAPM method and utilizing a 6% market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 2.7% based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of
April 8, 2022, and a 1.2 predicted beta per Barra. This analysis indicated an implied range of fully diluted equity values for SailPoint common stock of
$54.63 to $57.36 per share.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for SailPoint
common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of SailPoint and future financial market
conditions.
General
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any
58
Table of Contents
particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all
analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given
various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan
Stanley’s view of the actual value of SailPoint. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond SailPoint’s control.
These include, among other things, the impact of competition on SailPoint’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of
any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of SailPoint and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates
contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the $65.25 per share
in cash to be received by holders of shares of SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement
and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of April 10, 2022 to the Board of Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or
to reflect the prices at which shares of SailPoint common stock might actually trade.
The $65.25 per share in cash to be received by holders of shares of SailPoint common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to
the Merger Agreement was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between SailPoint and Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors.
Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Board of Directors during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to
SailPoint or the Board of Directors, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
Merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other
alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not,
constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how SailPoint Stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the
Board of Directors with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether the Board of Directors would have been willing to
agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.
The Board of Directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global
financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is
engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as
providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a
principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions,
for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of SailPoint, Parent, Thoma Bravo and their respective
affiliates, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument. In addition,
Morgan Stanley, its affiliates directors or officers, including individuals working with SailPoint in connection with the Merger, may have committed and
may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by Thoma Bravo or its affiliates and their affiliated funds’ respective portfolio
companies (which we refer to collectively as the “Thoma Bravo Related Entities”).
59
Table of Contents
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided SailPoint financial advisory services and an opinion, described in this section and
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the Merger, and SailPoint has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $62
million for its services, $3 million of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as
Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, upon the closing of the Merger, Morgan Stanley
may receive additional value resulting from adjustments to the Capped Call Transactions between Morgan Stanley and SailPoint entered into in
connection with SailPoint’s issuance of convertible notes due in 2024. SailPoint has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including
fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, SailPoint has agreed to indemnify
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan
Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
In the thirty months prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing
services for SailPoint and received aggregate fees of approximately $2 to $5 million in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of
Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing services for Thoma Bravo and the Thoma Bravo Related Entities,
and have received aggregate fees of approximately $10 to $25 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial
advisory and financing services to SailPoint, Thoma Bravo, Thoma Bravo Related Entities and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to
receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Capped Call Transactions",60,69
"Sailpoint Technologies Holdings, Inc._20220531_DEFM14A_20138375_4470787.Pdf",Capped Call Transactions,"Capped Call Transactions
On September 19, 2019, in connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, SailPoint entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the
“Base Capped Call Transactions”) with each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A., RBC Capital Markets, LLC and
Jefferies International Limited or their respective affiliates (the “Capped Call Counterparties”). On September 20, 2019, in connection with the initial
purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, SailPoint entered into additional capped call transactions with the Capped
Call Counterparties (the “Additional Capped Call Transactions” and, together with the Base Capped Call Transactions the “Capped Call Transactions”).
The Capped Call Transactions initially covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of SailPoint common stock that
initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is $28.42 per share of SailPoint common stock, and the cap price
of the Capped Call Transactions is $41.34 per share of SailPoint common stock, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call
Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to SailPoint Stockholders upon conversion of the
Convertible Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that SailPoint could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted
Convertible Notes upon conversion thereof, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.
If the Merger is consummated, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes, which would result in termination of the Capped
Call Transactions. Under the terms of the documents governing the Capped Call Transactions, each Capped Call Counterparty would be obligated to pay
SailPoint the “fair value” of the transaction, determined pursuant to the terms of the relevant Capped Call Transaction. Such termination value will be
determined by each Capped Call Counterparty, in its capacity as the calculation agent under its Capped Call Transaction, acting in good faith and in a
commercially reasonable manner. The amount of such early termination cash payment would depend on a variety of factors, including the remaining term
of its Capped Call Transaction as of the date on which the Merger is consummated, the Per Share Merger Consideration, the volatility of SailPoint
common stock prior to the announcement of the Merger, hedge unwind costs and applicable interest rates.
60Table of Contents
In addition, following the announcement of the Merger, the Capped Call Counterparties may adjust the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, regardless
of whether the Merger is consummated. Each Capped Call Counterparty may determine, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, in its
capacity as calculation agent with respect to its Capped Call Transaction, the economic effect of such an announcement on the value of its Capped Call
Transaction and may take into account a number of factors, including, the date of the announcement (and the remaining term of its Capped Call
Transaction at that time), the stock price of SailPoint common stock and changes in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected dividends of
SailPoint common stock, in determining whether an adjustment to its Capped Call Transaction is appropriate. Each Capped Call Counterparty may make
additional adjustments to its Capped Call Transaction following the announcement of a change to the Merger, including a withdrawal from, or the
abandonment or discontinuation of, the Merger.
The indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of the Capped Call Transactions were included as
exhibits to SailPoint’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by SailPoint with the SEC on September 25, 2019. All references in this section captioned “Capped
Call Transactions” to share counts, conversion prices and strike prices may change from time to time in accordance with the terms of the relevant
confirmations (the “Capped Call Confirmations”).

Summary of Projections
Except for financial outlooks with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection with its ordinary course earnings announcements,
SailPoint does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other results due to the inherent
unpredictability of the underlying assumptions, estimates and projections, especially over the longer term periods. In connection with the evaluation of
the Merger, however, SailPoint’s management in January 2022 prepared certain unaudited, preliminary financial forecasts for SailPoint for fiscal years 2022
through 2026; these forecasts are defined elsewhere in this proxy statement as the “January 2022 Projections”. In March 2022, SailPoint’s management
updated the January 2022 Projections to reflect SailPoint’s actual full year 2021 and fourth quarter 2021 financial results, which are referred to in this
section as the “March 2022 Projections.” The January 2022 Projections and the March 2022 Projections were made available to Morgan Stanley and the
March 2022 Projections were extrapolated through calendar year 2036 by Morgan Stanley with the guidance of SailPoint management (which
extrapolations were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by SailPoint management) (such extrapolations and the March 2022 Projections,
collectively, the “March 2022 Case”), in each case, in connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Board of Directors as described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.” The March 2022 Case is referred to elsewhere in this proxy statement as the
“Projections.” The January 2022 Projections and the March 2022 Case are referred to in this section collectively as the “Management Projections.”
SailPoint is including a summary of both the January 2022 Projections and the March 2022 Case in order to provide SailPoint Stockholders with access to
information that was made available to the Board of Directors and the Special Committee in connection with their evaluation of the Merger and the Per
Share Merger Consideration. The January 2022 Projections and the March 2022 Projections were also made available to Parent and Merger Sub at Parent’s
request in connection with their due diligence review, except that the Unlevered Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA and Stock-Based Compensation

Important Information Regarding the Management Projections
The Management Projections were developed by SailPoint management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although the
Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by SailPoint
management with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as
well as matters specific to SailPoint’s business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond SailPoint’s
control. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from the results forecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, SailPoint’s performance, industry
performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws,
regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in SailPoint’s reports filed with the SEC.
There can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the
Management Projections. The Management Projections cover several years, and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each
successive year. In addition, the Management Projections will be affected by SailPoint’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the
applicable periods. The Management Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot, therefore,
be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections
should not be regarded as an indication that SailPoint, Morgan Stanley, their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or
anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and this information should not be
relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Management
Projections will be necessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made by SailPoint or any other person regarding the Management
Projections or SailPoint’s ultimate performance compared to such information. The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction
with the historical financial statements and other information about SailPoint contained in SailPoint’s public filings with the SEC. For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.” In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties
inherent in the Management Projections, SailPoint Stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.
The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published guidelines of
the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to the preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The Management
Projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. Grant Thornton LLP has
not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Management Projections and,
accordingly, Grant Thornton LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Grant Thornton LLP report
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relates to the Company’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the
Management Projections and should not be read to do so.
Non-GAAP EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA (SBC burdened) and Unlevered Free Cash Flow contained in the Management Projections summarized above are
“non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial
measures used in the Management Projections were relied upon by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its opinion and by the Board of Directors and the
Special Committee in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. The SEC rules which
64
Table of Contents
would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures
included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy
statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Morgan Stanley for purposes of its opinion or by the
Board of Directors or the Special Committee in connection with their evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, SailPoint has not provided a reconciliation of
the financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used
by SailPoint may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP
financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP
financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The summary of such information above is included solely to give SailPoint Stockholders access to the information that was made available to the Board
of Directors, the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley, Parent and Merger Sub, and is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any
SailPoint Stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to their
shares of SailPoint common stock. In addition, the Management Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the
date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, SailPoint does not intend to update
or otherwise revise the Management Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect
the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.
Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger",70,74
"Sailpoint Technologies Holdings, Inc._20220531_DEFM14A_20138375_4470787.Pdf",Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger,"Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that SailPoint Stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, SailPoint Stockholders
should be aware that certain of SailPoint’s non-employee directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in
addition to, those of SailPoint Stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and recommending that the Merger Agreement be
adopted by SailPoint Stockholders.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions were used:
•
The Effective Time is May 16, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this
section (the “Change in Control Date”);
•
The employment of each executive officer of SailPoint will have been terminated by SailPoint without “cause” or due to the executive
officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Severance Pay Plan), in either case, immediately following the
Change in Control Date; and
•
The potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback” to avoid the “golden parachute”
excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
For purposes of this disclosure, (1) SailPoint’s executive officers are: (i) Mark McClain, Chief Executive Officer; (ii) Colleen Healy, Chief Financial Officer;
(iii) Matt Mills, President, Worldwide Field Operations; (iv) Chris
65Table of Contents
Schmitt, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and (v) Grady Summers, Executive Vice President, Product and (2) SailPoint’s named
executive officers are: (i) Mark McClain, Chief Executive Officer; (ii) Colleen Healy, Chief Financial Officer; (iii) Cam McMartin, former Interim Chief
Financial Officer; (iv) Matt Mills, President, Worldwide Field Operations; (v) Jason Ream, former Chief Financial Officer; (vi) Chris Schmitt, Executive Vice
President, General Counsel and Secretary; and (vii) Grady Summers, Executive Vice President, Product.
Although Jason Ream, SailPoint’s former Chief Financial Officer, is a named executive officer for purposes of this disclosure, Mr. Ream does not hold any
unvested SailPoint equity awards and does not have any interests in the Merger except insofar as he may hold vested stock options or shares of
SailPoint common stock.
As the amounts provided below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate as of the date referenced,
the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
Treatment and Quantification of Company Equity Awards
Company Options
At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per
Share Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint common
stock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to applicable withholding taxes.
At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per
Share Merger Consideration over (ii) the per-share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint
common stock underlying such Unvested Company Option. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts will vest and
become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would
have vested pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company Option
Consideration.
Company RSUs
At the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of
SailPoint common stock underlying such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to applicable withholding taxes.
At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
66
Table of Contents
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of SailPoint common stock underlying such Unvested Company RSU by (y)
the Per Share Merger Consideration. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company RSU Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time
as the Unvested Company RSU from which such Unvested Company RSU Consideration was converted would have vested pursuant to its terms and,
subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company RSU Consideration.
Quantification of Company Equity Awards
At the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU held by a non-employee member (the only equity award held by the non-employee members of the
Board of Directors) of the Board of Directors will convert into Merger Consideration in the manner described above. Based on the assumptions described
above under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger—Certain
Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable to SailPoint’s eight (8) non-employee directors in respect of their Vested
Company RSUs is $1,470,735, which excludes any grants of Company RSUs that may be made by SailPoint to the non-employee directors following the
date of this proxy statement.
At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company Option held by the executive officers will convert into cash awards of
Unvested Company RSU Consideration and Unvested Company Option Consideration in the manner described above and will generally remain subject
to the same time-based vesting conditions and other terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each award of
Unvested Company RSU Consideration and Unvested Company Option Consideration will vest in the event that an executive officer experiences a
termination of employment by SailPoint without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason,” in either case, within three (3) months prior to the
Change in Control Date or within the one (1) year following the Change in Control Date.
See the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation” for an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each SailPoint named executive officer (including each SailPoint executive
officer) in respect of his or her Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs.
Severance Pay Plan
SailPoint adopted a Severance Pay Plan under which each of the executive officers is eligible to receive certain severance payments benefits upon a
qualifying termination of employment. The Severance Pay Plan generally provides that if the executive officer’s employment is terminated by SailPoint
without “cause” or the executive officer terminates his or her employment with “good reason,” in either case, within three (3) months prior to the Change
in Control Date or within one (1) year following the Change in Control Date, then the executive officer will be eligible to receive:
•
a lump-sum cash severance amount equal to 100% of the executive officer’s annual base salary (or 150% of the annual base salary for the
Chief Executive Officer);
•
continuation coverage for the executive officer and his or her spouse and eligible dependents under SailPoint’s group health plans pursuant
to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, for twelve (12) months (or eighteen (18) months for the Chief
Executive Officer) at active employee rates, unless such coverage is earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Severance Pay
Plan; and
67
Table of Contents
•
accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity compensation awards held by the executive officer immediately prior to such termination of
employment, with performance-based equity awards vesting at the greater of actual performance as of such termination of employment or
target performance.
The provision of payments and benefits described above is conditioned upon the executive officer’s execution of a release of claims. The Severance Pay
Plan further provides that if an executive officer receives any amount that is subject to the “golden parachute” excise tax imposed pursuant to Section
280G and 4999 of the Code, the amount of the payments to be made to the executive officer will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of
the excise tax.
Transaction and Retention Bonus Programs
Under the Merger Agreement, SailPoint may establish a transaction program (the “Transaction Bonus Program”) and a retention program (the “Retention
Program”) providing for cash bonuses in the aggregate amount not to exceed $5.0 million. Awards under the Transaction Bonus Program shall be
allocated by SailPoint’s Chief Executive Officer and shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable after, but no later than thirty (30) days following,
the Effective Time, subject to the participant’s continued service through the Effective Time. Awards under the Retention Program shall also be allocated
by SailPoint’s Chief Executive Officer and shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable after, but no later than thirty (30) days following, the date
that is six months following the Effective Time, subject to the participant’s continued service through the end of such six(6)-month period. As of the date
of this proxy statement, none of the executive officers has received an award under the Transaction Bonus Program or the Retention Program.
Compensation Arrangements with Parent
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of SailPoint’s executive officers has discussed or entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its
affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the
closing of the Merger, however, some or all of SailPoint’s executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements with Parent or any of its affiliates
regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, SailPoint’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and
coverage for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from the surviving corporation.
This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on, or otherwise
relates to, the Merger that will or may become payable to each named executive officer of SailPoint in connection with the Merger. Although Jason Ream,
SailPoint’s former Chief Financial Officer, is a named executive officer for purposes of this disclosure, Mr. Ream terminated employment with SailPoint on
February 28, 2022 and does not hold any unvested SailPoint equity awards and does not have any interests in the Merger except insofar as he may hold
vested stock options or shares of SailPoint common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Ream has been omitted from the table below. For additional details regarding
the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and
Directors of SailPoint in the Merger.”
68
Table of Contents
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant
date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur prior
to completion of the Merger, including any equity award grants that may be made after the assumed effective time of May 16, 2022 . For purposes of
quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
The Effective Time is May 16, 2022, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this
section;
•
The employment of each executive officer of SailPoint will have been terminated by SailPoint without “cause” or due to the executive
officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Severance Pay Plan), in either case, immediately following the
Change in Control Date; and
•
The potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback” to avoid the “golden parachute”
excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code.

Cash. Represents severance payable to each named executive officer in the form of lump-sum cash payments upon a termination of employment by
SailPoint without “cause” or by the named executive officer for “good reason,” in each case, pursuant to the Severance Pay Plan. The severance
amounts payable under the Severance Pay Plan to each named executive officer constitute “double-trigger” payments, which means that the
amounts will become payable only on a qualifying termination of employment within three (3) months prior to the Change in Control Date or within
one (1) year following the Change in Control Date. For further details regarding the severance amounts that may become payable to SailPoint’s
named executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the
Merger—Severance Pay Plan.”
(2)
Equity. Represents the value of the Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs held by each named executive officer. Mr.
McMartin does not hold any unvested equity awards. The amounts payable in respect of those Unvested Company Options and Unvested
Company RSUs that convert into cash awards of Unvested Company Option Consideration and Unvested Company RSU Consideration at the
Effective Time and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement are “double-trigger” payments, which means that the amounts will
become payable on the original vesting dates, subject to the named executive officer’s continued employment with SailPoint through the applicable
vesting dates.
Pursuant to the Severance Pay Plan, each named executive officer’s Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs will become vested
upon a termination of employment by SailPoint without “cause” or by the named executive officer for “good reason” within three (3) months prior
to the Change in Control Date or within the twelve (12) months following the Change in Control Date. The amounts payable in respect of those
Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs that become Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs and as a result of a
qualifying termination of employment within three (3) months prior to the Change in Control Date or within the twelve (12) months following the
Change in Control Date are “double-trigger” payments. For further details regarding the treatment of the Vested Company Options and Vested
Company RSUs held by the named executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and
Directors of SailPoint in the

Perquisites/Benefits. Represents the value of continued health and welfare benefits coverage under the Severance Pay Plan. The continued health
and welfare benefits coverage is a “double-trigger” payment, which means that the amounts will become payable only on a qualifying termination
of employment within three (3) months prior to the Change in Control Date or within one (1) year following the Change in Control Date. For further
details regarding the benefits amounts that may be provided to SailPoint’s named executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger—Severance Pay Plan.”

Mr. McMartin was our Interim Chief Financial Officer until Ms. Healy’s appointment as Chief Financial Officer on March 16, 2022 and he is still
employed by the Company in a special advisory capacity. Accordingly, he is still entitled to severance benefits under the Severance Pay Plan.
Special Committee Compensation
In consideration of the expected time and effort that would be required of the members of the Special Committee in evaluating a potential transaction, the
Board of Directors determined that each other member of the Special Committee would receive additional compensation of $1,500 per meeting of the
Special Committee. Such fees were payable whether or not a potential transaction was entered into or consummated by the Company. No other meeting
fees or other compensation (other than reimbursement for reasonable expenses in connection with the discharge of their duties or their engagement of
advisors) will be paid to the members of the Special Committee in connection with their service on the Special Committee.

We presently anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be approximately $7.5 billion, which will be
funded via equity and debt financing described below together with SailPoint’s cash on hand as of the Closing Date.
Parent and Merger Sub have represented to SailPoint that they will have available to them, together with SailPoint’s cash on hand, sufficient funds to pay
the fees and expenses required to be paid at the closing of the Merger by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement. This includes funds
needed to: (1) pay SailPoint Stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement for their SailPoint common stock, (2) make payments in respect

70Table of Contents
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the financing contemplated by the Financing
Letters) by or to Parent or any of its affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under
the Merger Agreement.
Equity Financing

concurrent consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and (iv) the receipt of the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter or, if applicable, alternative debt financing or written confirmation that the debt financing contemplated by the Debt

Financing.”
The obligation of the Thoma Bravo Fund to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the
consummation of the closing of the Merger and the payment of the aggregate merger consideration, (ii) thirty (30) days following the termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (iii) the occurrence of any event which, by the terms of the Guaranty, is an event which terminates
the Thoma Bravo Fund’s obligations or liabilities under the Guaranty.
SailPoint is an intended and express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter solely with respect to enforcing Parent’s right to cause the
commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter by the Thoma Bravo Fund to be funded to Parent in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter, and
to cause Parent to enforce its rights against the Thoma Bravo Fund to perform its funding obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, in each case
subject to (i) the limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Debt Financing

If the Merger is consummated, SailPoint Stockholders who continuously hold shares of SailPoint common stock through the Effective Time, who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their demands or
otherwise lose their rights of appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 the DGCL
(“Section 262”). The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its
entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary
does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that SailPoint Stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under
Section 262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of SailPoint common stock unless
otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of SailPoint common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in
that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of SailPoint common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a
bank, broker, trust or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner
to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of SailPoint common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, SailPoint Stockholders who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of their shares; (ii) do not vote in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (iii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time; and (iv) otherwise
exactly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive
payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of SailPoint common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be “fair value,” if any, as determined by the court. However, after
an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all SailPoint Stockholders who have asserted
appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares
of SailPoint common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares of SailPoint common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million
(conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for
good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”)
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid.
However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily
pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the
time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The
Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days
prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was
73Table of Contents
such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and
include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes SailPoint’s notice to SailPoint Stockholders that appraisal rights are available
in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any
SailPoint Stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so, should review Annex C carefully.
Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A
SailPoint Stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger
Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of SailPoint common stock,
SailPoint believes that if a SailPoint Stockholder considers exercising such rights, that SailPoint Stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
SailPoint Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of SailPoint common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
the SailPoint Stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the SailPoint Stockholder must deliver to SailPoint a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting;
•
the SailPoint Stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder
will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time); and
•
the SailPoint Stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of SailPoint common stock held either in a voting trust or by
a nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the “fair value” of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is
under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a SailPoint
Stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not
vote his, her or its shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any SailPoint Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to SailPoint, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the
Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to SailPoint Stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of
the SailPoint Stockholder’s shares, and that SailPoint Stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A
holder of shares of SailPoint common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made
and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless
revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the SailPoint Stockholder’s right of appraisal and
will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a SailPoint Stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must ensure that the proxy submitted contains instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting.
Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of
itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A SailPoint Stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the
taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of SailPoint Stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
74
Table of Contents
Only a SailPoint Stockholder of record is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in
respect of shares of SailPoint common stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform SailPoint of the
identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If the shares
are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf
of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be
executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint owners, may execute a demand
for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the
demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
SAILPOINT STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO
WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF
THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A
BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY
MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Austin, Texas 78726
Any SailPoint Stockholder who has delivered a written demand to SailPoint and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Per Share Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the
Merger Agreement by delivering to SailPoint a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made
more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any SailPoint Stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any SailPoint
Stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such SailPoint Stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share Merger Consideration within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is
commenced and SailPoint, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required,
or, except with respect to any SailPoint Stockholder who withdraws such SailPoint Stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the
immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a SailPoint
Stockholder, the SailPoint Stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could
be less than, equal to or more than the Per Share Merger Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of SailPoint common
stock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant
75
Table of Contents
to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date
thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any SailPoint Stockholder who has
complied with Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant shares) may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of
a petition filed by a SailPoint Stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the “fair value” of the shares held by all dissenting
SailPoint Stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and
SailPoint Stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the “fair value” of
the shares of SailPoint common stock. Accordingly, any SailPoint Stockholder who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary
action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of SailPoint common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.
The failure of a holder of SailPoint common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the SailPoint Stockholder’s
previous written demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of SailPoint common stock who has complied with the requirements
of Section 262 and who is entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which SailPoint
has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the
requesting SailPoint Stockholder within ten (10) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten
(10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of SailPoint common
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request
from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a SailPoint
Stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of SailPoint common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified
list containing the names and addresses of all SailPoint Stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the
value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and
place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of SailPoint Stockholders shown on the written statement
described above at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne
by the Surviving Corporation. After notice to SailPoint Stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those SailPoint Stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights
thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require SailPoint Stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates
(if any) to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any SailPoint Stockholder fails to
comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that SailPoint Stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery
will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all SailPoint Stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.

Table of Contents
Determination of “Fair Value”
After determining SailPoint Stockholders entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to
SailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the
“fair value” of the shares of SailPoint common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the “fair value.” In determining “fair value,” the Delaware Court of Chancery
will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time
through the date of payment of the judgment will compound quarterly and accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge)
as established from time to time during the period from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid. However, at any time before the Delaware
Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each SailPoint Stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of
such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.
In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining “fair value” in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Supreme Court of Delaware stated that, in making this determination of “fair value,” the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light
on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that “fair value” is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the
Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting SailPoint
Stockholder’s exclusive remedy.
SailPoint Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not
seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, “fair value” under Section 262. No representation is
made as to the outcome of the appraisal of “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and SailPoint Stockholders should recognize
that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Neither
SailPoint nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Merger Consideration to any SailPoint Stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each
of SailPoint and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of SailPoint common stock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a
petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to SailPoint Stockholders seeking
appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and
expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged
77
Table of Contents
upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a SailPoint Stockholder, the Delaware
Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a SailPoint Stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares
entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any SailPoint Stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of SailPoint common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively
loses or withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of SailPoint common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. A SailPoint Stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the
holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership
thresholds described above has been satisfied as to SailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the SailPoint Stockholder delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no SailPoint Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of SailPoint common
stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s
shares of SailPoint common stock, if any, payable to SailPoint Stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if
neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to SailPoint Stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or if the SailPoint
Stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within sixty
(60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such SailPoint Stockholder to an
appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as
to any SailPoint Stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any SailPoint Stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such SailPoint Stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within
sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a SailPoint Stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, any SailPoint Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those
rights.

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to SailPoint Stockholders
whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on

This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax consequences other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other non-
income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income or non-income tax consequences, or the consequences of the Medicare tax on net
investment income. If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner
of shares of SailPoint common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of SailPoint common stock and partners therein should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger to their particular circumstances.
No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger described herein. This summary is
not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the tax consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS
or that they would be sustained by a court if so challenged.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS
CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS.

Table of Contents
U.S. Holders
This section applies to “U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of SailPoint common stock
that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons
as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a
United States person as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of SailPoint common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash
received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of SailPoint common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted
tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of SailPoint common stock. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the Merger. A reduced
tax rate on capital gain will generally apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
This section applies to “Non-U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of SailPoint
common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment, such as “controlled foreign corporations” or
“passive foreign investment companies.” Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax
consequences that may be relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in
which case such gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to a United States person as defined
under the Code, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of
30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty); or
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred eighty-three (183) days or more in the taxable
year of the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate
of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty).
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger.
Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a U.S. Holder that
80
Table of Contents
furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a
substitute successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that provides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS
Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability;
provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
HOLDERS OF SAILPOINT COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER TO THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER
TAX LAWS.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
SailPoint and Parent have agreed to take all action necessary to comply with all regulatory notification requirements, and, subject to certain limitations, to
obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals
include approval under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust laws (whether domestic or foreign).
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until SailPoint and Thoma Bravo Fund XV-a, L.P. each files a
Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the
applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-
calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification and report forms. If the FTC or DOJ issues a request for
additional information and documents (which we refer to as a “Second Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must
observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the Second Request.
SailPoint and Thoma Bravo Fund XV-a, L.P. each filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger with the FTC and
DOJ on April 29, 2022. The HSR waiting period is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on May 31, 2022.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC,
the DOJ or any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin
the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or seeking to require the parties to license or hold separate assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Other Regulatory Approvals
The Merger is subject to the expiration of the applicable review periods under, or the receipt of approvals or clearances under, the relevant foreign
investment laws of Australia and the United Kingdom, in each case unless a relevant exemption applies. In addition, relevant regulatory bodies could take
action under other applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking
81
Table of Contents
to enjoin or otherwise prevent the completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to
take legal action under regulatory laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on regulatory grounds will
not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not
rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of SailPoint, Parent and Merger Sub, because the

Merger Consideration
SailPoint Common Stock
At the Effective Time, and without any action required by any SailPoint Stockholder, each share of SailPoint common stock (other than Excluded Shares,
which include, for example, shares of SailPoint common stock owned by SailPoint Stockholders who have properly and validly exercised their statutory

automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that SailPoint’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the
following treatment as of the Effective Time:
Company Options
Each Vested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Vested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint common stock
underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to any required withholding of taxes.
Each Unvested Company Option will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the contingent
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option by (y) the total number of shares of SailPoint common stock
underlying such Unvested Company Option. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the
same time as the Unvested Company Option from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would have vested pursuant to
its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company Option Consideration.

affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company RSU Consideration
amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU from which such Unvested Company RSU Consideration was
converted would have vested pursuant to its terms and, subject to certain exceptions, will otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the receipt of the Unvested Company
RSU Consideration.
Treatment of Company ESPP

such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of SailPoint common
stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled at
the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to withholding of any applicable withholding taxes.

Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by SailPoint are qualified as to “materiality” or “Company Material Adverse

thereof);

or warranty to the extent that such representation or warranty expressly addresses consequences resulting from the execution of the Merger
Agreement or the consummation or pendency of the transactions contemplated thereby);
•
the identity of Parent or any of its affiliates as the acquiror of SailPoint;
•
compliance with the terms of, or the taking or omission of any action expressly required by, the Merger Agreement or consented to or

or pendency of the transactions contemplated thereby or with respect to any covenants relating to conduct of SailPoint during pendency of
the Merger);

effect or circumstance has had a materially disproportionate adverse effect on SailPoint and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other companies
operating in the industries in which SailPoint and its subsidiaries operate, in which case only the incremental material and disproportionate adverse
impact may be taken into account in determining whether there has occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the No-Shop Period Start Date, SailPoint, its
affiliates and their respective representatives have the right to: (i) solicit, initiate, propose, induce the making or submission of, encourage or facilitate in
any way any offer or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (as defined in this section
of this proxy statement below), including by providing information (including non-public information and data) relating to SailPoint and any of its
subsidiaries and affording access to the businesses, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of SailPoint
and its subsidiaries to any third person (and its representatives, including potential financing sources of the third person) that has entered into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided that SailPoint must provide Parent and
92Table of Contents
Merger Sub (and their representatives, including financing sources) with access to any information or data that is provided to any third person given
such access that was not previously made available (whether prior to or after the execution of the Merger Agreement) to Parent or Merger Sub
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to the third person (and in any event within 24 hours thereof) and (ii) continue, enter into, engage
in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third person (and their respective representatives, including potential financing
sources of the third person) regarding any Alternative Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, offers or proposals or any other effort or attempt that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal), and cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate in any way, any such
inquiries, offers, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Alternative Acquisition Proposals or other proposals that
could reasonably be expected to lead to Alternative Acquisition Proposals, including by granting a waiver, amendment or release under any pre-existing
“standstill” or other similar provision to the extent necessary to allow for an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or amendment to an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal to be made confidentially to SailPoint or to the Board of Directors. SailPoint must also notify Parent within 24 hours of entering into
any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
If SailPoint terminates the Merger Agreement prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 26, 2022 to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal received from an Excluded Party, then SailPoint would be required to pay a termination fee of $81,750,000 to Parent. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation.”
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means an agreement with SailPoint that is either (i) in effect as of the date the Merger Agreement was entered
into, or (ii) executed, delivered and effective after the date the Merger Agreement was entered into, in either case containing provisions that require any
counterparty thereto (and any of its affiliates and representatives named therein) that receive non-public information of or with respect to SailPoint and/or
its subsidiaries to keep such information confidential; provided, however, that, with respect to such agreements executed and delivered following the
execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the provisions contained therein relating to the confidential treatment of information and the use
thereof are not materially less restrictive in the aggregate to such counterparty (and any of its affiliates and representatives named therein) than the terms
of the confidentiality agreement entered into between SailPoint and Thoma Bravo (it being understood that such agreement need not contain any
“standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making of any Alternative Acquisition Proposal) and that such agreement does not contain
provisions which prohibit SailPoint from providing any information to Parent in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
“Alternative Acquisition Proposal” means any offer, proposal or indication of interest by a third person relating to or concerning (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, tender offer, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
SailPoint, in each case, as a result of which SailPoint Stockholders immediately prior to such transaction would cease to own at least 75% of the total
voting power of SailPoint or the surviving entity (or any direct or indirect parent company thereof), as applicable, immediately following such transaction,
(ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any third person of assets constituting or accounting for more than 25% of the consolidated assets, revenue or net
income of SailPoint and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (including equity interests in any subsidiaries), or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by
any third person of more than 25% of the outstanding shares of SailPoint common stock or securities representing more than 25% of the total voting
power of SailPoint.
“Excluded Party” means any third person (i) from whom SailPoint received a written Alternative Acquisition Proposal after the date of the Merger
Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and (ii) whose Alternative Acquisition Proposal the Board of Directors determines in good faith
prior to the start of the No-Shop Period Start Date, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and legal counsel, either to be a Superior Proposal
or an Alternative Acquisition Proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
93
Table of Contents
Proposal; provided, however, that a third person will immediately cease to be an Excluded Party (and the provisions of the Merger Agreement applicable
to Excluded Parties will cease to apply with respect to such third person) if (1) the Alternative Acquisition Proposal is withdrawn by the third person or
(2) the Alternative Acquisition Proposal, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside financial advisor
and legal counsel, no longer is or would no longer be reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.
“Superior Proposal” means a written Alternative Acquisition Proposal substituting in the definition thereof “80%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place
each such phrase appears, that (i) was not solicited in violation of the non-solicitation obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (ii) the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with SailPoint’s outside legal and financial advisors, and considering such factors as the Board of
Directors considers to be appropriate (including (a) all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal (including certainty of closing) and the
identity of the third person making the Alternative Acquisition Proposal and (b) any revisions to the Merger Agreement made or proposed in writing by
Parent prior to the time of such determination in accordance with the change of recommendation provisions of the Merger Agreement), to be more
favorable to SailPoint and SailPoint Stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

From the date of the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, SailPoint has
agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate the making or submission of any offer or proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal;
•
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Acquisition Proposal with, or furnish any non-public information
relating to SailPoint or its subsidiaries for the purpose of facilitating an Alternative Acquisition Proposal to, any third person that has made
or, to SailPoint’s knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, or afford any third person access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of SailPoint or its subsidiaries for the purpose of
encouraging, inducing or facilitating an Alternative Acquisition Proposal;
•
approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal; or
•
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, or other acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
similar agreement with respect to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
In addition, SailPoint has agreed to (i) cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any third person and its representatives, (ii)
request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning SailPoint and its subsidiaries furnished to any person with whom a
confidentiality agreement with respect to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal was entered into at any time within twelve (12) months immediately
preceding the No-Shop Period Start Date, (iii) cease providing any further information with respect to SailPoint or any Alternative Acquisition Proposal to
any such third person or its representatives and (iv) terminate all access granted to any such third person or its representatives to any physical or
electronic data room (or any other diligence access).
Notwithstanding these restrictions, SailPoint may continue to engage in the activities delineated in the previous two paragraphs with respect to any
Excluded Party (but only for so long as such person is and remains an
94Table of Contents
Excluded Party), including with respect to any amended or modified Alternative Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded Party following the No-
Shop Period Start Date.
Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint Stockholders, if SailPoint
receives an Alternative Acquisition Proposal from a third party that was not received in response to, or as a result of, any material breach of SailPoint’s
non-solicitation obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) SailPoint and its representatives may contact the third party making such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, and (ii) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal and financial advisors, that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions in respect of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, then SailPoint may: (A) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including its representatives and
potential equity and debt financing sources) with respect to such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, and (B) furnish nonpublic information to the third
party making such Alternative Acquisition Proposal (and its representatives and potential equity and debt financing sources) if, prior to so furnishing
such information, the third party has executed an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with SailPoint; provided that SailPoint provides to Parent and
Merger Sub (and their respective representatives) any information or data that is provided to such third party that was not previously made available to
Parent or Merger Sub prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such third party (and in any event within 24 hours thereof).
SailPoint will notify Parent that it has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement within 24 hours after the execution thereof.
Both during the Go-Shop Period and after the No-Shop Period Start Date but prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint Stockholders,
SailPoint is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal unless it
complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a five (5)-business-
day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a “Superior
Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such negotiations.
If SailPoint terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint Stockholders for the purpose of entering into
an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal, other than entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal received from an
Excluded Party prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 26, 2022, then SailPoint must pay a $212,540,000 termination fee to Parent.
As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 24 hours following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, SailPoint shall deliver to Parent a
written notice setting forth: (i) the identity of each Excluded Party from which SailPoint has received during the Go-Shop Period an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal that remains pending and (ii) the material terms and conditions of any such pending Alternative Acquisition Proposal made by each
such Excluded Party. SailPoint shall (whether during or after the Go-Shop Period) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent of (A) the
entry by SailPoint or any of its subsidiaries into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with a third party who has made or could make an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal (or, if such third party was already party to a confidentiality agreement with SailPoint or any of its subsidiaries, then SailPoint shall
instead notify Parent within 24 hours of granting data room access to such third party or its representatives, it being understood that such notification
need only be made one time with respect to such third party and its representatives) and (B) any Alternative Acquisition Proposal received by SailPoint
or any of its subsidiaries or representatives, which notice shall be provided orally and in writing, and which shall identify the material terms and
conditions thereof (and, thereafter, any material change to the terms thereof) and (unless expressly prohibited pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in
effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement) the person or group making such Alternative Acquisition Proposal and include copies of all documents
and other

written materials (including any letter of intent, term sheet or draft of definitive agreement) submitted with such Alternative Acquisition Proposal. From
and after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, SailPoint shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and any
material developments (including all amendments or proposed amendments, whether or not in writing) regarding any Alternative Acquisition Proposals or
any material change to the terms of any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, and promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide Parent with
copies of all documents and other written materials (including any letter of intent, term sheet or draft or definitive agreement) relating to any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal (including the financing thereof).
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means an agreement with SailPoint that is either (i) in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or (ii)
executed, delivered and effective after the date of the Merger Agreement, in either case containing provisions that require any counterparty thereto (and
any of its affiliates and representatives named therein) that receive non-public information of or with respect to SailPoint and/or its subsidiaries to keep
such information confidential; provided, however, that, with respect to such agreements executed and delivered following the execution and delivery of
the Merger Agreement, the provisions contained therein relating to the confidential treatment of information and the use thereof are not materially less
restrictive in the aggregate to such counterparty (and any of its affiliates and representatives named therein) than the terms of the nondisclosure

agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making of any Alternative Acquisition Proposal) and that

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that SailPoint Stockholders
vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors will not effect a Change of
Recommendation except as described below.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint Stockholders, the Board of Directors may not take any action described in the following (any
such action, a “Change of Recommendation”):
•
withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner
adverse to Parent), the recommendation of the Board of Directors (it being understood that it shall be considered a modification adverse to
Parent if (1) any Alternative Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced and the Board of Directors fails to
publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by SailPoint Stockholders within ten (10) business days of
commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (2) any Alternative Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced
(other than by the commencement of a tender or exchange offer) and the Board of Directors fails to issue a public press release within five
(5) business days of such public announcement providing that the Board of Directors reaffirms the recommendation of the Board of

•
approve, recommend or declare advisable any Alternative Acquisition Proposal (or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable

•
fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation of the Board of Directors within five (5) business days after Parent so requests in writing (it
being understood that SailPoint will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than three (3) separate occasions (provided that,
in the event Parent has not previously requested the Board of Directors to make such a reaffirmation, there shall be no limit on the number
of reaffirmations that Parent may request in response to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal)); or
96Table of Contents
•
fail to include the recommendation of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger in this proxy statement.
Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement prohibits SailPoint or the Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable law or rules and policies of the NYSE, including taking and disclosing to SailPoint Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to SailPoint Stockholders) or from issuing a “stop, look
and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to SailPoint Stockholders if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such disclosure
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that (1) any such statement or
disclosure must be subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of SailPoint or the
Board of Directors and the rights of Parent under the applicable section of the Merger Agreement, and (2) nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to
permit SailPoint or the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation other than in accordance with the applicable section of the Merger
Agreement.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint Stockholders, the Board of Directors may
effect a Change of Recommendation if (i) SailPoint has received a Superior Proposal or (ii) there has been an Intervening Event (as defined herein), in each
case, that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that the failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
The Board of Directors may only effect a Change of Recommendation or authorize SailPoint to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement if:
•
the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that the failure to do so
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
•
SailPoint has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days in advance of the Company’s intention to effect a
Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal, which shall include a description of
the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, the identity of the person or entity making the Superior Proposal and a copy of any
proposed definitive agreement(s) relating to such Superior Proposal, including any related financing commitments, if any;
•
SailPoint has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal;
•
SailPoint has negotiated in good faith with Parent and its representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and/or the commitment letters so that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal;
•
following such five (5)-business-day period, the Board of Directors (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel
and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement that are binding on Parent and
Merger Sub and irrevocable by Parent and Merger Sub until the expiration of the foregoing five (5)-business-day period (assuming the
execution and delivery by SailPoint of the applicable definitive agreement) and any other information provided by Parent) has determined
that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such a Change of Recommendation or to terminate the Merger Agreement would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

•
in the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause SailPoint to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, SailPoint will have validly terminated the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement,

Parent and to comply with the requirements of the Merger Agreement with respect to such new written notice (it being understood that the five (5)-
business-day period shall be three (3) business days with respect to such new written notice, but in no event shorter than five (5) business days
following the original written notice).
In addition, the Board of Directors may only effect a Change of Recommendation for an Intervening Event if:
•
the Board of Directors has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days in advance of SailPoint’s intention to effect
a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event, which notice must specify the basis for such Change of
Recommendation, which shall include a description in reasonable detail of the applicable Intervening Event;
•
prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation, the Board of Directors have given Parent an opportunity to meet and negotiate with
SailPoint and its advisors during the foregoing five (5)-business-day period (to the extent that Parent desires to so meet and negotiate) to
discuss the foregoing Intervening Event and any adjustments or revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent in
response thereto to obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation; and
•
following such five (5)-business-day period, the Board of Directors, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and taking
into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, shall have determined that the failure of the
Board of Directors to make such a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that each time any material amendment or modification to the
Intervening Event occurs, SailPoint shall notify Parent of such amendment or modification in writing and the time period set forth in the
preceding second (2nd) bullet shall recommence and be extended for two (2) business days from the day of such notification (provided that
the time period shall in no event be shorter than five (5) business days following the original written notice).
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development that is
unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or if known or reasonably foreseeable to the
Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board
of Directors as of the date of Merger Agreement; provided that (a) the receipt, existence or terms of an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or Superior
Proposal, or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that SailPoint meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of
revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, or changes after the date of
the Merger Agreement in the market price or trading volume of SailPoint’s common stock or the credit rating of SailPoint (it being understood that the
underlying cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (b) may be considered and taken into account), in each case, shall not be deemed to be an
Intervening Event under the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, SailPoint will, and Parent will cause SailPoint to, honor all SailPoint employee
plans in accordance with their terms. Parent acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) will occur at the Effective Time for purposes of
the employee plans.
For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (A) the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time and (B) the date of
termination of the Company Employee, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates to provide to each current employee of SailPoint and its
subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remains so employed immediately after the Effective Time (“Company Employees”) (i) base compensation and
target annual or short-term cash incentive opportunities (including target short-term commission-based cash incentive opportunities) that, in each case,
are no less favorable than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity
and equity-based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that were provided to the Company Employee immediately
before the Effective Time.
For all purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under the corresponding employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee will be credited with his or her years
of service with SailPoint and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same purpose as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time. However, the foregoing will not apply with respect
to any defined benefit pension benefits or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to and replaces a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and
vision insurance benefits to any Company Employee, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all preexisting condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived or satisfied under the comparable plans of SailPoint or its subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and Parent will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan to the extent such amounts
were credited to such person for the same purpose under the Old Plan.",108,108

Parent, Merger Sub and SailPoint have agreed that all indemnification or other similar agreements between any current or former directors, officers or
employees, on the one hand, and SailPoint or any of its subsidiaries, on
101Table of Contents
the other hand, as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, will survive the Merger and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of SailPoint
and of any subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of SailPoint or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), pending or asserted or any claim made within
such period will continue until the final disposition of the Proceeding or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such six (6)-year period. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent will assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, the indemnification provisions of the Merger Agreement.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, to the fullest extent provided in the governing and organizational documents
of SailPoint and its subsidiaries and all indemnification or other similar agreements between any current or former directors, officers or employees,
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of SailPoint or any of its subsidiaries and any person who served as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
at the request of or for the benefit of SailPoint or its subsidiaries (each, an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with a Proceeding, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of SailPoint or its subsidiaries), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in all
cases solely to the extent provided in the governing and organizational documents of SailPoint and its subsidiaries. In the event of any such Proceeding,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Proceeding.
In addition, prior to the Effective Time, SailPoint will purchase a six (6)-year “tail” insurance policy on SailPoint’s current policies of directors’ and officers’
liability insurance on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by SailPoint and its subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, including
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided that the aggregate cost of such “tail” policy will not
exceed 400% of the last annual premium paid by SailPoint, and if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the maximum amount, SailPoint,
Parent, or the Surviving Corporation will only be required to obtain as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance under the indemnification provisions
of the Merger Agreement.
Parent has also agreed to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other indemnification obligations provided in the Merger Agreement in the event Parent is found to have been in breach.

Parent, Merger Sub and SailPoint agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the parties do not timely perform the provisions of the Merger Agreement (including any party failing to take such actions as are
required of it in order to consummate the Merger Agreement). Parent, Merger Sub and SailPoint acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement: (i) the non-breaching party will be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, including monetary damages), to obtain (A) a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (B) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach and (ii) the fees and expenses provisions of the Merger Agreement are not intended to and would not adequately compensate SailPoint, on the
one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of the Merger Agreement, and will not be construed
to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (iii) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither SailPoint nor Parent would have entered into the Merger Agreement.
It is explicitly agreed that, subject to the limitations of the next two sentences, SailPoint will have the right to specific performance in connection with
enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the financing to be funded (including to cause Parent to enforce
the obligations of the Thoma Bravo Fund under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter) subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein
and in the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the right of SailPoint to seek
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded to fund a portion of the amount required to consummate the Merger and to make all payments required to be made in connection therewith (but
not the right of SailPoint to seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the
requirements that (i) all of the (x) joint conditions to Parent, Merger Sub and SailPoint’s obligations to consummate the Merger and (y) conditions to
Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger, in each case, have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), (ii) the Debt Financing has
been funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof if the Equity
Financing is funded, (iii) SailPoint has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then SailPoint shall
take such actions that are required of it by the Merger Agreement to arrange and consummate the closing of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement and (iv) Parent and Merger Sub will have failed to consummate the Merger by the time Closing was to occur under the Merger
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements for any financing under the terms thereof,
SailPoint is not entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance of the Merger Agreement against any debt financing source. Additionally, the
election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief will not restrict, impair or otherwise limit SailPoint from, in the alternative,
seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement and collect the Parent Termination Fee; provided that in no event will SailPoint be permitted to pursue an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief or any other remedy under the Merger Agreement or available at

Parent, Merger Sub and SailPoint agree not to raise any objections to (i) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement by SailPoint, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand; and (ii) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement will
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives any right
that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, SailPoint is required to submit a proposal to SailPoint
Stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to SailPoint’s named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This compensation
is summarized in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger.” The Board of Directors
encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.
Accordingly, SailPoint is asking you to approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of SailPoint approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that will or may become payable to
SailPoint’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in
the section captioned ‘The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of SailPoint in the Merger.”’
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you
may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote
on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on SailPoint. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted and the Merger is
completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this
Compensation Proposal.
Vote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation
Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of voting power of capital stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is
present, (i) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (ii)
abstentions will be counted as votes “AGAINST” on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal and (iii) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect
on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of SailPoint common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked
proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a SailPoint Stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating
voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of SailPoint common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If SailPoint Stockholders approve the adjournment
proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies, including soliciting proxies from SailPoint Stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the
Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient
number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn
the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to
votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at
the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of April 10, 2022 by and among Project Hotel California
Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Parent”), Project Hotel California Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are
sometimes referred to herein collectively as the “Parties,” and individually as a “Party.” All capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective
meanings ascribed thereto in Annex A.
W I T N E S S E T H:

Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;
WHEREAS, acting upon the recommendation of the special committee (the “Special Committee”) of the board of directors of the Company (the
“Company Board”), the Company Board has unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared
it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the

stockholder, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (c) resolved to recommend that the sole stockholder of Merger Sub
adopt this Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub; and

Time, Parent and the Company shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub

Corporation”) and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

shall cause a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL in order to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the Company and
Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred
to as the “Effective Time”).

Sub, the Company or the holders of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:
(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Company
Common Stock”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive $65.25 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). All shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 1.4(b) shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist on the conversion
thereof, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4(b).
(c) Treatment of Cancelled Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company (as treasury stock or
otherwise), Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor (such shares, the “Cancelled Shares”).
(d) Treatment of Dissenting Shares. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to
the extent required thereby), shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who have properly exercised and validly perfected appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with,
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such shares held by any such holder (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with, but only if, as and when required by, the provisions of such Section 262, unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses its rights to
A-2Table of Contents
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such
Dissenting Shares shall thereafter be no longer considered Dissenting Shares under this Agreement and shall be treated as if they had been converted
into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in accordance with Section 1.4(b). At the Effective
Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of
Company Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the Merger and afford Parent the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands and the Company shall consider in good faith comments or suggestions proposed by
Parent with respect to such demands. The Company shall not make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or settle any such
demands without the prior written consent of Parent.
(e) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.

(a) Company Options.
(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is vested in accordance with its terms and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company Option”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the
Merger Consideration over (ii) the per-share exercise price for such Vested Company Option, by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Vested Company Option Consideration”); provided,
however, that if the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Vested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Vested Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not a
Vested Company Option (each, an “Unvested Company Option”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i)
the Merger Consideration over (ii) the per-share exercise price for such Unvested Company Option, by (y) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Unvested Company Option (the “Unvested Company Option Consideration”); provided, however, that if the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock of such Unvested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Unvested
Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof. Subject to the holder’s continued
service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested
Company Option Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Company Option from which such Unvested Company
Option Consideration was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, except as provided on Section 1.5 of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, shall otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such
other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of
the Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts, provided that no such changes shall impair the rights of the applicable holder of
A-3Table of Contents
Unvested Company Option Consideration) with respect to their receipt of the Unvested Company Option Consideration.
(b) Company RSUs.
(i) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and either (x) held by a
non-employee member of the Company Board or (y) vested in accordance with its terms as of the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company RSU”)
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Vested Company RSU
Consideration”).
(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and not a Vested
Company RSU shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Merger Consideration (the “Unvested Company RSU Consideration”). Subject to the holder’s
continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates,
such Unvested Company RSU Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Company RSU from which such
Unvested Company RSU Consideration was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, except as provided on
Section 1.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedules, shall otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
underlying Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are
appropriate to conform the administration of the Unvested Company RSU Consideration amounts, provided that no such changes shall impair the
rights of the applicable holder of Unvested Company RSU Consideration) with respect to their receipt of the Unvested Company RSU
Consideration.
(c) Certain Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, acting through the Company Board or an appropriate committee thereof, shall
take or cause to be taken, all actions, and provide all notices that are required to effectuate the terms of this Section 1.5. All Company Equity Plans (other
than the agreements underlying, and the terms of the Company Equity Plans applicable to, the Unvested Company Option Consideration and the
Unvested Company RSU Consideration, in each case, solely to the extent relevant to the terms and conditions of this Section 1.5) will terminate as of the
Effective Time and the Company will take all action necessary to effect the foregoing. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
following the Effective Time no participant in any such Company Equity Plans will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Following the date hereof, the Company shall provide to Parent or its counsel
for review and approval drafts of any documentation prepared by the Company or its counsel to effectuate the foregoing and shall consider in good faith
Parent’s timely comments thereto.
(d) Treatment of Employees Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Company ESPP, as soon as practicable (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company ESPP) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required so that (i) participation in the Company ESPP shall be limited to those employees
who are participants on the date of this Agreement, (ii) participants may not increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions from those
in effect on the date of this Agreement or make any separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement,
(iii) no offering period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iv) each then outstanding purchase right shall be exercised as of the earlier
of (A) the end of the offering period in effect on the date of this Agreement or
A-4
Table of Contents
(B) ten (10) days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs, and (v) the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to, but contingent
upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP). On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each
participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company
ESPP, as amended pursuant to this Section 1.5(a), and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(b), subject to withholding of any
applicable withholding Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP, as amended pursuant to this Section
1.5(d), be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest).",134,136

(c) As of the date hereof, Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter,
Debt Fee Letters and Equity Commitment Letter, and in the case of the Debt Fee Letters, subject to redaction solely of the fee amounts, pricing caps,
original issue discount, “market flex” and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with transactions of this type, none of
which redacted provisions would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination, aggregate principal amount or
availability of the Debt Financing.
(d) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Financing
Sources and the Equity Investor, as applicable, to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Debt Financing Sources or the
Equity Investor, as applicable, to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating to the

unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does
Parent have knowledge as of the date hereof that any Debt Financing Sources or Equity Investor will not perform its obligations thereunder. There are no
side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment Letters that could affect the
conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Financing.
(e) The Financing, if funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters and giving effect to any “flex” provision in or related to the Debt
Commitment Letter (including with respect to fees and original issue discount), shall provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for

or required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or the Commitment Letters (such amounts, collectively, the “Financing
Amounts”). From and after the Closing Date, Parent, together with the Surviving Corporation, will have sufficient cash on hand or other sources of
immediately available funds to enable it to settle conversions or effect redemptions of the Convertible Notes pursuant to the terms of the Convertible
Notes Indenture.
(f) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters constitute the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, all the other parties thereto and are in full force and effect. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent no event has occurred
which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent under the terms and conditions
of the Commitment Letters. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment
Letters on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due to be paid by it on or before the Closing Date. As of the date
hereof, the Commitment Letters have not been modified, amended or altered and none of the respective commitments thereunder have been terminated,
reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission thereof is
contemplated (except as contemplated or as permitted as of the date hereof in the Debt Commitment Letter). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
amendment, supplement or modification to effectuate any “market flex” terms contained in the Debt Fee Letters provided as of the date hereof or to add or
replace any additional agents, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other financial institutions thereto as provided for in the Debt
Commitment Letter shall be permitted and shall not require written consent of the Company.
(g) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing) by Parent or any of its Affiliates or any
other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s obligations under this Agreement.

concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, and anything in

dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such document or response, and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments
proposed by Parent. The Company shall respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement (or

Proxy Statement (which resolution will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company prior to the end of the tenth (10th)
calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, the “Clearance Date”); provided
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if the Clearance Date occurs prior to the end of the Go-Shop Period, the Company will not
be required to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company until the expiration of the Go-Shop Period but shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days) after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period.

reasonably practicable following the Clearance Date. Once established, the Company shall not change the record date for the Company Stockholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as otherwise required by
applicable Law. Unless the Company

shall have made a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 7.3(d), the Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting
(including by soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement).
(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts
and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting (i) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the
time that the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder
Meeting (it being understood that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times or for more than 45
calendar days in total pursuant to this clause (ii) without Parent’s prior written consent), (iii) if the Company reasonably determines in good faith that the
Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained (it being understood that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting more than two times or for more than 45 calendar days in total pursuant to this clause (iii) without Parent’s prior written consent) or
(iv) with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without the prior written consent of
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement)

adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the Company Recommendation (it being
understood that it shall be considered a modification adverse to Parent if (1) any Alternative Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange
offer is commenced and the Company Board fails to publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company’s
stockholders within ten (10) Business Days of commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (2) any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced (other than by the commencement of a tender or exchange offer) and the Company Board fails to issue a public press
release within five (5) Business Days of such public announcement providing that the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation), (ii)
approve, recommend or declare advisable any Alternative Acquisition Proposal (or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal), (iii) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (it
being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions (provided that, in the event
Parent has not previously requested the Company Board to make such a reaffirmation, there shall be no limit on the number of reaffirmations that Parent
may request in response to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal)) or (iv) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any such
action, a “Change of Recommendation”). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation and/or cause the Company to terminate this

provided that (A) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that the failure
to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company shall have given Parent at least
five (5) Business Days prior written notice of the Company’s intention to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in response to
such Superior Proposal, which shall include a description of the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person making the

Agreement that are binding on Parent and Merger Sub and irrevocable by Parent and Merger Sub until the expiration of the foregoing five-Business Day
period (assuming the execution and delivery by the Company of the applicable definitive agreement) and any other information provided by Parent) shall
have determined that the failure of the Company Board to make such a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (F) in the event of a termination of this Agreement in order to cause the
Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1(c)(iii), including paying the Company Termination Fee. In the event of any material amendments or modifications to such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that any change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification),
the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 7.3(d) with respect to such new
written notice (it being understood that the five (5) Business Day period shall be three (3) Business Days with respect to such new written notice, but in
no event shorter than five (5) Business Days following the original written notice). In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may also effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside
legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, provided that (i) the Company Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of the Company’s
intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event, which shall include a description in reasonable detail of the
applicable Intervening Event, (ii) the Company Board shall have given Parent an opportunity to meet and negotiate with the Company and its advisors
during the foregoing five (5) Business Day period (to the extent that Parent desires to so meet and negotiate) to discuss the foregoing Intervening Event
and any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response thereto to obviate the need to effect a Change of
Recommendation, and following such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and
taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall have determined that the failure of the Company
Board to make such a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that each time any material amendment or modification to the Intervening Event occurs, the Company
shall notify Parent of such amendment or modification in writing and the time period set forth in the preceding clause (ii) shall recommence and be
extended for two (2) Business Days from the day of such notification (provided that the time period shall in no event be shorter than five (5) Business
Days following the original written notice).
(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying
with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law or rules and policies of NYSE, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or
from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make
such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that (1) any
such statement or disclosure pursuant to this Section 7.3(e) must be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise
affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board and the rights of Parent under this Section 7.3, and (2) nothing in the foregoing will be

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives) to use reasonable best
efforts to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the
Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Commitment Letters and the Debt Fee Letters as promptly as reasonably practicable
but in any event prior to the Closing Date, including by using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing (the “Definitive Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein
(including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any Debt Fee Letter), (iii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions,
which are within Parent or Merger Sub’s control, in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Agreements and comply with its obligations thereunder
and (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that all conditions contained in the
Commitment Letters (other than the consummation of the Merger and those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at Closing) have
been satisfied or waived, Parent shall (1) use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources to comply with their respective obligations
under the Debt Commitment Letter and (2) cause the Equity Investor to comply with its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, in each case,
including to fund the Financing on the Closing Date, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.
(b) Parent shall not without the prior written consent of the Company: (i) permit any amendment, termination or modification to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or any Debt Fee Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy: (A) adds
new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Financing, (B) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue discount contemplated by the
Debt Fee Letters on the date of this Agreement unless the amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount)
such that the aggregate amount of the Financing would be less than the amount required to pay the Financing Amounts, (C) adversely affects the ability
of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement or (D) otherwise
would reasonably be expected to hinder, delay or prevent the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement or modification to
effectuate any “market flex” terms contained in the Debt Fee Letters provided as of the date hereof or to add or replace any additional agents, lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other financial institutions thereto as provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter that otherwise
complies with this Section 7.4(b)) shall be permitted and shall not require written consent of the Company. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company
copies of any written amendment, modification, waiver or replacement relating to the Financing promptly upon execution thereof.
(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing required, together with the portion of the Financing that remains available, to pay
the Financing Amounts becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt
financing (the “Alternative Financing”) (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Financing, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the Financing Amounts) from the same or other sources and which are on terms (taken as a
whole) not less favorable to Parent (or its Affiliates) than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and which do not include any conditions to the
consummation of such Alternative Financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing and (ii) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any commitment letters and any related fee letters
(subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction
A-43Table of Contents
solely of fee amounts, pricing caps, original issue discount, “market flex” and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with
transactions of this type, none of which redacted provisions would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability,
termination, aggregate principal amount or availability of the Alternative Financing on the Closing Date) with respect to any Alternative Financing. As
applicable, for the purposes of this Agreement, (A) the term “Commitment Letters” shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in
question) and (B) the Debt Financing shall include any Alternative Financing. Parent shall provide the Company with (x) prompt written notice of any
material breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters relating to the Financing and (y) a copy of any
written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any actual or alleged (in writing) material breach, default,
termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Fee Letter. To the extent requested by the Company,
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and in reasonable detail of its efforts to consummate the
Financing and, upon the Company’s reasonable request, provide to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of the material Definitive
Agreements for the Debt Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Parent with this Section 7.4 shall not relieve Parent of its obligations
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available.
(d) From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives) to use reasonable best efforts, to provide customary cooperation with Parent and Merger
Sub, in each case, at Parent’s sole cost and expense, as is customary for financings of the type contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing

(a) Change in Control. Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company
Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time.
(b) Company Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor all Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms (it being understood that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Surviving Corporation, Parent or its
Affiliates from amending, modifying, replacing or terminating such arrangements in accordance with their terms).
(c) Post-Closing Protection Period. For the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (A) the first (1st)
anniversary of the Effective Time and (B) the date of termination of the Company Employee (such earlier period, the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to provide to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who
remains so employed immediately after the Effective Time (“Company Employees”) (i) base compensation and target annual or short-term cash incentive
opportunities (including target short-term commission-based cash incentive opportunities) that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to
the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that nothing set forth in this Section 7.7 will require Parent to provide compensation in the form of equity or equity-based compensation.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company Employee whose employment
terminates during the Continuation Period under circumstances that would give rise to cash severance pay or benefits under the existing terms of the
Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules and designated thereon as a severance plan, policy or practice
(the “Company Severance Plans”), cash severance pay equal to the cash severance pay provided under the Company Severance Plans. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 7.7 to the contrary, the terms and conditions of employment of any Company Employee whose terms and conditions of
employment are subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement, shall be governed by such applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement.
(d) Service Crediting. For all purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under the corresponding employee benefit
plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the
same extent and for the same purpose as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that
the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any defined benefit pension benefits or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to and replaces a Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and vision insurance benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered

Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, if applicable, any costs and expenses of the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (and the obligations of the Equity
Investor under the Guarantee (in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof) with respect thereto), the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(ii) and receipt of payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall, subject to Section 9.5, be the sole and exclusive remedy

for fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement or (B) for any breach of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, further, that under no
circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for breaches (including any willful and
material breach) under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement), the Guarantee or the

Merger Sub, the Parent Related Parties or the Lender Related Parties shall have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of or in connection with
any Transaction Related Matters, except that nothing shall relieve Parent of its obligations under Section 7.6, Section 7.10 and Section 7.4(e), and none of
the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any other Company Related Party shall seek or be entitled to seek or recover any damages or seek or be entitled to any

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other
Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, (i) the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to obtain (A) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance
and performance of such covenant or obligation and (B) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, and (ii) the provisions of Section 8.3
are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that
would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause Parent to cause the Equity Financing to be funded under the Equity Commitment Letter and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations
to consummate the Merger if, but only if, (A) all of the conditions in Section 2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b) have been, and continue to be, satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied at the
Closing)) at the time the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.1, (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that, if specific performance is
A-59Table of Contents
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur in accordance with Section 2.1 and (D) Parent and Merger
Sub shall have failed to consummate the Merger by the time the Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1. In no event shall the
Company be entitled to enforce specifically Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (or exercise its third party beneficiary rights
under the Equity Commitment Letter) if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to a remedy of specific performance or other equitable remedies
against any Debt Financing Source. The election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief shall not restrict, impair or
otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.3(b); provided that in no event shall the Company be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief or any other
remedy under this Agreement or available at law or equity following the payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.
(c) Each Party further agrees that (i) it will not raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) no other Party or any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 9.5, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.
