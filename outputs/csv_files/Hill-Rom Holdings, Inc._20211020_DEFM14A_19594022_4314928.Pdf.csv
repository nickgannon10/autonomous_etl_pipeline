common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of Hillrom common
stock owned by Baxter, Merger Sub, any wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter, Hillrom or any wholly owned subsidiary
of Hillrom, in each case, other than certain of such shares held on behalf of third parties (collectively, the “excluded

The merger agreement provides that outstanding Hillrom equity awards will be treated as follows at the effective time,
subject to all required withholding taxes:
Each outstanding Hillrom stock option will become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and converted into
the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock
underlying such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (y) (i) the excess, if any, of the per share
merger consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price of such stock option, less applicable taxes. Each Hillrom
stock option with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the per share merger consideration will be
cancelled at the effective time with no consideration.
Each outstanding Hillrom restricted stock unit award (a “Hillrom RSU Award”) granted before the date of the merger
agreement and each outstanding Hillrom RSU Award granted on or after the date of the merger agreement

right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock underlying
such Hillrom RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time and (y) the per share merger consideration, less
applicable taxes.
Each outstanding Hillrom RSU Award granted on or after the date of the merger agreement excluding any such
Hillrom RSU Award granted to a non-employee director (a “Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Award”) will be converted
automatically into a Baxter restricted stock unit award with respect to the number of shares of Baxter common stock
determined by multiplying: (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock subject to such Post-Signing Hillrom
RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time by (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the per share merger
consideration by (B) the per share average closing price of Baxter common stock for the consecutive period of ten
(10) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the last trading day prior to the closing date. Such
converted award will otherwise continue on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Hillrom
RSU Award, including any provisions for acceleration of vesting.
Each outstanding Hillrom performance-based restricted stock unit award (a “Hillrom PRSU Award”) will become fully
vested and be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock underlying such Hillrom PRSU Award immediately prior to the
effective time based on a payout percentage of 146% (in the case of such award granted in Hillrom’s 2020 fiscal year)
or 187.5% (in the case of such award granted in Hillrom’s 2021 fiscal year) and (y) the per share merger consideration,
less applicable taxes.
Prior to the effective time, the Hillrom Board or a committee thereof, as applicable, will adopt resolutions providing
that: (i) except for the offer period that was ongoing as of the date of the merger agreement (the “final offering
period”), no offering period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of the merger agreement, (ii) each
Hillrom Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) participant’s accumulated contributions under the Hillrom ESPP shall
be used to purchase shares of Hillrom common stock as of the end of the final offering period in accordance with the
Hillrom ESPP, (iii) the applicable purchase price for shares shall not be decreased below the levels set forth in the
ESPP as of the date of the merger agreement and (iv) the ESPP shall terminate at the effective time.

After careful consideration, the Hillrom Board unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger,
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Hillrom Board in
reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement can be found in the section entitled “The Merger-Reasons for the Merger.”
The Hillrom Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote:
•
“FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement;
•
“FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such
adjournment to approve the merger agreement (the “adjournment proposal”); and
•
“FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may
be paid or become payable to Hillrom’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger (the “named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal”).

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) delivered its opinion to the Hillrom Board that, as of September 1, 2021
and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the per share merger consideration to
be paid to the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than Baxter and its affiliates), pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Hillrom common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated September 1, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and
3TABLE OF CONTENTS
assistance of the Hillrom Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not
a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Hillrom common stock should vote with respect to the merger,
the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter
between Hillrom and Goldman Sachs, Hillrom has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee that is estimated,
based on the information available as of the date of the merger agreement, at approximately $86 million, all of which is
contingent upon consummation of the merger. See the section entitled “The Merger-Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.

In connection with the merger, on September 1, 2021, at a meeting of the Hillrom Board held to evaluate the merger,
representatives of BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”) delivered to the Hillrom Board the oral opinion of BofA
Securities, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 1, 2021, to the effect that, as of the
date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in the written
opinion, the per share merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of shares of Hillrom common
stock (other than holders of excluded shares), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion to the Hillrom Board, which describes, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The summary of BofA
Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the written opinion. BofA Securities
delivered its opinion to the Hillrom Board for the benefit and use of the Hillrom Board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the per share merger consideration from a financial point of
view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect or implications of the merger and no opinion or
view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might
be available to Hillrom or in which Hillrom might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Hillrom to
proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Securities’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
shareholder should vote or act in connection with the merger or any other matter.
Pursuant to an engagement letter between Hillrom and BofA Securities, Hillrom has agreed to pay BofA Securities an
aggregate transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the merger agreement,
at approximately $11 million, $1.5 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion and the remainder of
which is contingent upon consummation of the merger.

Financing of the Merger (see page 53)",12,12
"Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc._20211020_DEFM14A_19594022_4314928.Pdf",Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger (see page 53)
The consummation of the merger is not subject to any financing conditions. Under a commitment letter dated as of
September 1, 2021 (which we refer to as the “bridge commitment letter”), by and among JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(which we refer to as “JP Morgan”), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (which we refer to as “Citi”), and Baxter, JP Morgan
and Citi have committed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge facility (which we refer to as the “bridge
facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $11.4 billion to bridge debt financing required (i) to fund the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) to repay, redeem or otherwise terminate any
indebtedness of Hillrom outstanding on the closing date (the “debt repayment”) and (iii) to pay fees and expenses
related to the merger, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the debt repayment. On September
30, 2021, Baxter entered into a new term loan credit agreement (which we refer to as the “term loan facility”) among
Baxter, as borrower, various lenders and JPMorgan, as administrative agent, pursuant to which a syndicate of
financial institutions have committed to provide Baxter with a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate
principal amount of $4.0 billion. The aggregate principal amount of the commitments under the term loan facility have
replaced a corresponding amount of the commitments in respect of the bridge facility in accordance with the terms of
the bridge commitment letter. As a result, there are now $7.4 billion in bridge facility commitments remaining. Baxter
has informed Hillrom that it expects to replace the remaining commitments under the bridge facility with cash on hand
and/or the issuance of senior unsecured notes.

The exchange of Hillrom common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
4TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consequences of the Merger”) who receives cash in the merger in exchange for shares of Hillrom common stock will
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.
You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” and consult
your tax adviser regarding the particular tax consequences of the merger to you, including any tax consequences
arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters. The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), which prevents Hillrom and Baxter from completing the
merger until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(the “DOJ”) and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires.
A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting
period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that
waiting period. The parties may also choose to voluntarily re-start the initial 30-calendar-day waiting period by
following certain prescribed procedures. After the expiration of the initial waiting period (or the re-started initial
waiting period), the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC may issue a Request for Additional Information and
Documentary Material (a “Second Request”). If a Second Request is issued, the parties may not complete the merger
until they substantially comply with the Second Request and observe a second 30-calendar-day waiting period,
unless the waiting period is terminated earlier, or the parties commit not to close for some additional period of time.
Hillrom and Baxter submitted the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act on September 13, 2021.
The waiting period under the HSR Act expired on October 13, 2021. Neither Hillrom nor Baxter received any inquiries
from the FTC or DOJ during the waiting period. On October 13, 2021, the FTC sent a form letter to Hillrom and Baxter
indicating that, while the waiting period has expired, the FTC reserves its right to take further action with respect to
the transaction, including challenging its consummation before or after the fact. This letter is consistent with the HSR
Act and the FTC’s recently announced practice of sending such letters to parties making filings under the HSR Act.
Foreign Regulatory Clearances. The completion of the Merger is subject to approval pursuant to antitrust and
competition laws with the appropriate regulators in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions. The parties
must observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances or consents pursuant to
certain of these foreign antitrust and competition laws before completing the merger. As of October 13, 2021, the
parties have submitted their initial filings for all required regulatory approvals (including in the European Union).
Other state or foreign antitrust, competition and foreign investment authorities may take action under the laws of
their jurisdictions, which could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger. For more information about
regulatory approvals relating to the merger, see the sections entitled “The Merger-Regulatory Clearances and
Approvals Required for the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.”
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the
merger, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or obligations or enter into
supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

We expect to complete the merger in early 2022. The merger is subject to various regulatory clearances and approvals
and other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Hillrom or Baxter could result in the merger
being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting
and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required
approvals.

As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the merger agreement, each party’s obligation to complete the
merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied, including:
•
approval of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Hillrom common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting;
•
(i) the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period (and any extensions) applicable to the
consummation of the merger under the HSR Act and, if applicable, any contractual waiting periods under
any timing agreements with a governmental entity applicable to the consummation of the merger and (ii)
certain specified required regulatory approvals and clearances having been obtained; and
•
no governmental entity having, after the date of the merger agreement, issued or entered any order that
continues to be in effect or enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law that continues to be
in effect and makes unlawful or restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the merger.

conditions:
•
the accuracy of representations and warranties made by Hillrom in the merger agreement (subject generally
to a material adverse effect standard);
•
the performance in all material respects by Hillrom of the obligations of Hillrom in the merger agreement at
or prior to the closing;
•
the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) since the date of the merger agreement; and
•
certain specified required regulatory approvals and clearances having been obtained without conditions
that impose a Burdensome Condition (as defined below).
The obligation of Hillrom to effect the merger is also subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions:
•
the accuracy of representations and warranties made by Baxter and Merger Sub in the merger agreement
(except to the extent the failure of a representation and warranty to be true and correct would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impair or materially delay the ability of Baxter or Merger Sub
to consummate the transaction); and
•
the performance in all material respects by Baxter and Merger Sub of the obligations of Baxter and Merger
Sub in the merger agreement at or prior to the closing.

Subject to certain exceptions, Hillrom has agreed that it will not, and that it will cause its directors and officers not to,
directly or indirectly, and that it will instruct and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries
other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
•
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry with respect to, or the making,
submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);
•
engage in, continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person (other than Baxter
and its representatives) regarding, or furnish any nonpublic information or access to any person with
respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead

•
take any action to exempt any third party from the restrictions on “business combinations” set forth in the
Indiana Business Corporation Law (“IBCL”) 23-1-43 or cause such restrictions not to apply (other than with
respect to Baxter and Merger Sub in connection with the merger agreement); or
•
agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.
Prior to approval of the merger agreement by Hillrom’s shareholders, however, Hillrom may, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, provide information to and engage in discussions or
negotiations with a third party if such third party has made an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a non de
minimis breach by Hillrom of the non-solicitation covenant of the merger agreement and the Hillrom Board
6TABLE OF CONTENTS
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below).

Subject to certain exceptions, the Hillrom Board must not effect a change in its recommendation that the Hillrom
shareholders approve the merger agreement. However, prior to the approval of the merger agreement by the Hillrom
shareholders, the Hillrom Board may, upon receipt of a Superior Proposal that did not result from a non de minimis
breach by Hillrom of the non-solicitation covenant of the merger agreement or in certain other circumstances relating
to unforeseen material events, change its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement and, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, may authorize Hillrom to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept the Superior Proposal,
subject to complying with certain notice and other specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including
giving Baxter the opportunity to make adjustments to the terms of the merger agreement in response to the Superior
Proposal so that such proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. If the Hillrom Board changes its
recommendation with respect to the merger agreement, Baxter may terminate the merger agreement, and Hillrom may
be required to pay Baxter a termination fee of $367 million.

The special meeting of Hillrom shareholders is scheduled to be held at 130 E. Randolph Street, Suite 1000, Chicago,
Illinois 60601 on December 2, 2021, 3:00 PM, Central Time. The special meeting is being held in order to consider and
vote on the following proposals:
•
to approve the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger” and
“The Merger Agreement,” respectively, of this proxy statement;
•
to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such
adjournment to approve the merger agreement; and
•
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid or become
payable to Hillrom’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, which is
further described under the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Hillrom’s Directors and Officers in the
Merger.”
Only holders of record of Hillrom common stock at the close of business on October 18, 2021, the record date for the
special meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements
of the special meeting.
The presence at the special meeting, in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of remote
communication, virtually, or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Hillrom common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to
be conducted at the special meeting. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting,
your shares will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. Failure of
a quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject
Hillrom to additional expense.
You may cast one vote for each share of Hillrom common stock that you own at the close of business on the record
date. The proposal to approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. The approval of each of the
adjournment proposal and the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal requires the votes cast
favoring such action to exceed the votes cast opposing such action. In addition, if a quorum does not exist, the
chairman of the special meeting, may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time.
An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person, or, in the event that the special meeting
is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special meeting,
abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Also, abstentions and a failure to vote your
shares of Hillrom common stock (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the
failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a broker to give voting instructions to the broker) will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Neither abstentions nor a
failure to vote your Hillrom common stock will have an effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal or the
named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal. For shares of Hillrom common stock held in “street
name,” only shares of common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement will be
counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.

If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not
revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted for the (i) approval of the merger agreement, (ii) approval of the adjournment of
the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Hillrom Board, to solicit additional proxies if there
are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to approve the merger agreement and (iii) approval of the
named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.

In considering the recommendation of the Hillrom Board to vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement,
Hillrom shareholders should be aware that Hillrom’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that
may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Hillrom shareholders generally, including potential severance
benefits, accelerated vesting of outstanding Hillrom equity awards and rights to ongoing indemnification and
insurance coverage. The Hillrom Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the merger), and in recommending to Hillrom
shareholders that the merger agreement be approved and adopted.",18,18

Baxter has agreed to, and has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, and
advance expenses as incurred to, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each present and
former (determined as of the effective time) director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the
benefit of Hillrom or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “indemnified parties”) against any costs, expenses,
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened proceeding, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to
have occurred whether before, at or after the effective time (including acts or omissions in connection with such
persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request of or for the
benefit of Hillrom).",18,18

As of October 20, 2021, four lawsuits have been filed by purported Hillrom shareholders in connection with the
merger. The complaints generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement”) filed by Hillrom
in connection with the merger fails to disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, to enjoin Hillrom from
consummating the merger, or in the alternative, rescission of the merger and/or compensatory damages, as well as
attorney's fees. For a more detailed description of such litigation relating to the merger, see the section entitled “The
Merger-Litigation Relating to the Merger.” Hillrom believes that the allegations in the complaints are without merit.
Additional lawsuits arising out of the merger may also be filed in the future.

The following are brief answers to certain questions that you, as a shareholder of Hillrom, may have regarding the
merger agreement, the merger, the special meeting and the proposals being considered at the special meeting.
Hillrom urges you to carefully read the remainder of this proxy statement because the information in this section
does not provide all the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger agreement, the
merger and the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the annexes to, and the
documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement.
Q:
What is the purpose of the special meeting?
A:
At the special meeting, shareholders will consider and act upon the matters outlined in the notice of meeting on
the cover page of this proxy statement, namely:
•
the approval of the merger agreement;
•
the approval of an adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time
of such adjournment to approve the merger agreement; and
•
the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of certain compensation that will or may be paid or become
payable to Hillrom’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.
Q:
Where and when is the special meeting?
A:
The special meeting is scheduled to be held at 130 E. Randolph Street, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60601 on
December 2, 2021, 3:00 PM, Central Time.
Q:
How does the Hillrom Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
A:
The Hillrom Board unanimously recommends that you vote as follows:
•
“FOR” the approval of the merger agreement;
•
“FOR” the approval of an adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes
at the time of such adjournment to approve the merger agreement; and
•
“FOR” the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of certain compensation that will or may be paid or
become payable to Hillrom’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger.
In considering the recommendation of the Hillrom Board to vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement, Hillrom shareholders should be aware that Hillrom’s directors and executive officers have
interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Hillrom shareholders
generally. For a more complete description of these interests, see the information provided in the section entitled
“The Merger-Interests of Hillrom’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 48.
Q:
How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of Hillrom common stock prior to
the announcement of the merger?
A:
The per share merger consideration of $156.00 per share represents a 7.5% premium to the $145.06 closing price
per share of Hillrom common stock on the NYSE on September 1, 2021, the last trading day before the public
announcement of the merger agreement, a 26.0% premium to the $123.78 closing price per share of Hillrom
common stock on July 27, 2021, the last trading day prior to initial media reports speculating about a potential
transaction; a 34.5% premium to the thirty (30)-day volume weighted average closing price of Hillrom common
stock as of July 27, 2021; and a 92.2% premium to the $81.17 closing price per share of Hillrom common stock on
September 24, 2020, which represented the lowest price per share of Hillrom common stock for the fifty-two (52)-
week period ending on September 1, 2021, the last trading day before public announcement of the merger
agreement. The closing price of Hillrom common stock on the NYSE on October 19, 2021, the most recent
practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, was $151.16 per share. You are encouraged to obtain
current market prices of Hillrom common stock in connection with voting your shares of Hillrom common stock.

1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What will happen in the merger?
A:
If the merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Hillrom, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub will cease and Hillrom will be the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Baxter. As a result of the merger, Hillrom common stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer
have any interest in the future earnings or growth of Hillrom or Baxter. In addition, Hillrom common stock will be
delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Hillrom will no longer be required to file
periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Hillrom common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable
law, rules and regulations.
Q:
Who will own Hillrom after the merger?
A:
Immediately following the merger, Hillrom will be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter.
Q:
What will I receive in the merger?
A:
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of
Hillrom common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded
shares) will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration of cash in the amount of
$156.00, without interest.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the merger agreement?
A:
The proposal to approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. A failure to vote your shares
of Hillrom common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve the merger agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal?
A:
The approval of the adjournment proposal requires the votes cast favoring such action to exceed the votes cast
opposing such action. A failure to vote your shares of Hillrom common stock or an abstention from voting will
have no effect on the adjournment proposal.
Q:
What vote is required to approve (on a non-binding, advisory basis) the named executive officer merger-
related compensation proposal?
A:
The approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal requires the votes cast
favoring such action to exceed the votes cast opposing such action. A failure to vote your shares of Hillrom
common stock or an abstention from voting will have no effect on the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to Hillrom’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the merger?
A:
The SEC rules require Hillrom to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain
payments that will or may be made to Hillrom’s named executive officers in connection with the merger. For
additional information, see the section entitled “Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related
Compensation Arrangements (Proposal 3).”
Q:
What will happen if Hillrom shareholders do not approve the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal?
A:
The vote to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and
apart from the vote to approve the merger agreement. Approval of the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning
that it will not be binding on Hillrom. Accordingly, while the Hillrom Board intends to consider the vote resulting
from this proposal, if the merger is completed, then the compensation that is related to the merger will be payable
to the extent that Hillrom is contractually obligated to pay such compensation, regardless of the outcome of the
advisory vote.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
In order to complete the merger, Hillrom must obtain the shareholder approval described in this proxy statement
and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement, including receipt of required regulatory approvals,
must be satisfied or waived. The parties to the merger agreement currently expect to complete the merger in early
2022, although Hillrom cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Because the merger is subject to
a number of conditions, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at this time.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger?
A:
The exchange of Hillrom common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who receives cash in the merger in exchange for shares of Hillrom common
stock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in
such shares.
You should read the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” and
consult your tax adviser regarding the particular tax consequences of the merger to you, including any tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is October 18, 2021. Only common shareholders of record at the close of
business on that date are entitled to attend in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means
of remote communication, virtually, and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof. Each share of Hillrom common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the meeting.
Q:
Who may attend the special meeting?
A:
Common shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 18, 2021, or their duly appointed proxies,
may attend the meeting. “Street name” holders (those whose shares are held through a broker, bank or other
nominee) should bring a copy of an account statement reflecting their ownership of Hillrom common stock as of
the record date. If you are a “street name” holder and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must also
bring a proxy from the record holder (your broker, bank or other nominee) of the shares of Hillrom common stock
authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. We intend to limit attendance to shareholders as of the record
date. All shareholders should bring photo identification. Cameras, recording devices, and other electronic
devices are not permitted at the special meeting.
Q:
Who is soliciting my vote?
A:
The Hillrom Board is soliciting your proxy, and Hillrom will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree M&A
Incorporated (“Innisfree”) has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid
approximately $25,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other
advisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail. Forms of
proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the
beneficial owners of shares of Hillrom common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic
mail or other electronic medium by Innisfree or, without additional compensation, by Hillrom or certain of
Hillrom’s directors, officers and employees.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement, including its annexes. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting in person, or, in the
event that the special meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, please submit a proxy to
vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the special
meeting. A failure to vote your shares of Hillrom common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
How do I vote if my shares are registered directly in my name?
A:
If you are a shareholder of record, there are four methods by which you may vote at the special meeting:
•
Internet: To vote over the Internet, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote over the
Internet, you do not have to mail in a proxy card.
•
Telephone: To vote by telephone, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote by
telephone, you do not have to mail in a proxy card.
•
Mail: To vote by mail, complete, sign and date a proxy card and return it promptly in the postage paid
envelope provided. If you return your signed proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your
shares as you direct.
•
In Person or Virtually: To vote in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of
remote communication, virtually, attend the special meeting in person or virtually, as applicable. You will be
given a ballot when you arrive. If we hold the special meeting solely by mean of remote communication
rather than in person, we will announce the decision to do so in advance and provide details on how to
participate in a press release to be issued by Hillrom and made available on our website, www.hillrom.com.
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting in person or virtually, as applicable, we urge you to vote by
proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote in person, or, in the event that
the special meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, if you have already voted by proxy. We
encourage you to vote over the Internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable
alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail.
Q:
How do I vote if my shares are held in the name of my broker (street name)?
A:
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, often referred to as held in “street name,” you will
receive a form from your broker, bank or other nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be
voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke
your instructions.
Q:
Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy?
A:
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the special meeting. If you are the
record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:
•
You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, whether over the Internet, by
telephone or by mail, at any time before your proxy is exercised at the special meeting;
•
You may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Hillrom’s Secretary at 130 E. Randolph
Street, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60601, provided such written notice is received before your proxy is
exercised at the special meeting; or
•
You may attend the special meeting and notify the election officials that you wish to revoke your proxy and
vote in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of remote communication,
virtually. Simply attending the special meeting in person or virtually, as applicable, will not, by itself, revoke
your proxy. If we hold the special meeting solely by means of remote communication, we will provide details
on the procedures for the special meeting on our website, www.hillrom.com.
If your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you will have to follow the instructions
provided by your broker or bank to change or revoke your proxy.

Q:
If the merger is completed, how do I obtain the per share merger consideration for my shares of Hillrom
common stock?
A:
Following the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the
right to receive your portion of the per share merger consideration. After the merger is completed, you will
receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written
instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates or book-entry shares
for the per share merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by your broker,
bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action,
if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the per share merger
consideration.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of common
stock now or with your proxy card. If the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send you a
letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock for the
per share merger consideration.
Q:
How many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?
A:
The presence at the special meeting, in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of
remote communication, virtually, or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Hillrom common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for
business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will
necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Hillrom to additional expense.
Q:
What if I abstain from voting?
A:
If you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal,
your shares will still be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Abstentions and a failure
to vote your shares of Hillrom common stock (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a

instructions to the broker) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger
agreement. Neither abstentions nor a failure to vote your shares of Hillrom common stock will have an effect on
the outcome of the adjournment proposal or the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.
For shares of Hillrom common stock held in “street name,” only shares of Hillrom common stock affirmatively
voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.
Q:
Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote by telephone or over the Internet or
in person?
A:
If you are a registered shareholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote by telephone, over
the Internet or in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of remote communication,
virtually, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your broker may vote
your shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters. Under
NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are
held in “street name” and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted at the
special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
You will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration if the merger is approved and completed
even if your shares are not voted at the special meeting.
Q:
What is a broker non-vote?
A:
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers that are present in person, or, in the event that the special meeting
is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to
which the broker is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal
and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers do not have
discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a
beneficial owner of shares of Hillrom common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to
the broker, then those shares will not be present in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by
means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy at the special meeting. For shares of Hillrom common
stock held in “street name,” only shares of common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to approve
the merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal. Broker non-votes will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement and will have no effect on the
adjournment proposal or the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
A:
This means you own shares of Hillrom common stock that are registered under different names or are in more
than one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a shareholder of record and other shares
through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive
multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions
for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares
you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by
mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
Q:
Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes
with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than
any shares you hold of record, any shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you
hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as
trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy
card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation
or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement
account must be voted under the rules governing the account.
Q:
Can I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?
A:
If you are unable to attend the special meeting or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of
remote communication, virtually, we encourage you to send in your proxy card or to vote by telephone or over
the Internet.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
Hillrom intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a
Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Hillrom
files with the SEC are publicly available.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not approved by the Hillrom shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any
other reason, Hillrom shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Hillrom common stock in
connection

with the merger. Instead, Hillrom will remain an independent public company and shares of Hillrom common
stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. The merger agreement provides that, upon termination
of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Hillrom may be required to pay to Baxter a termination fee
of $367 million. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee Payable by Hillrom” for a
discussion of the circumstances under which such a termination fee may be required to be paid. The merger
agreement also provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain other circumstances,
Baxter may be required to pay to Hillrom a termination fee of $420 million. See the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Termination Fee Payable by Baxter” for a discussion of the circumstances under which such a
termination fee may be required to be paid.
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about Hillrom?
A:
Hillrom will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2020 Annual
Report to Shareholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020,
without charge to any shareholder who makes a written request to our Secretary at 130 E. Randolph Street, Suite
1000, Chicago, Illinois 60601. Hillrom’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings may also be accessed
at www.sec.gov or on Hillrom’s Investor Relations website at https://ir.hill-rom.com/ir-home/. Hillrom’s website
address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our
website is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other
reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address
with another shareholder?
A:
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for
proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single
proxy statement to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,”
potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. Hillrom and some
brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple
shareholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from
the affected shareholders. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to
receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and
you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares are
held in a brokerage account or Hillrom if you are a shareholder of record by sending a written request to our
Secretary at 130 E. Randolph Street, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60601 or calling (312) 819-7200. In addition,
Hillrom will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate
copy of the proxy statement.
Q:
Who should I contact if I have any questions?
A:
If you have questions about the merger or the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or desire
additional copies of this proxy statement or additional proxy cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you
should contact:

At the special meeting, Hillrom shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to approve the merger agreement, which is further described in the sections entitled “The Merger” and
“The Merger Agreement” of this proxy statement;
•
to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such
adjournment to approve the merger agreement; and
•
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will or may be paid or become
payable to Hillrom’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, discussed
under the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Hillrom’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger” of this proxy statement.
Hillrom shareholders must approve the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If the Hillrom shareholders fail to
approve the merger agreement, the merger will not occur.
Hillrom does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or

common stock held by Hillrom or by any of its subsidiaries are not considered to be outstanding for purposes of
determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a
quorum to be represented at the special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject
Hillrom to additional expense. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of
determining a quorum at the special meeting and any adjournment of the special meeting. However, if a new record
date is set for the adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. If you submit a properly

a quorum is present at the special meeting.

An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is
held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy, but abstains from voting. At the special meeting,
abstentions will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Abstentions and a failure to vote your
shares of Hillrom common stock (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a proxy card and the
failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a broker to give voting instructions to the broker) will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Neither abstentions nor a
failure to vote your Hillrom common stock will have an effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal or the
named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal. For shares of Hillrom common stock held in “street
name,” only shares of common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement will be
counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.
If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including an instruction to abstain) in an executed, duly returned and not
revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted for (i) approval of the merger agreement, (ii) approval of the adjournment of the
special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of
such adjournment to approve the merger agreement and (iii) approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of certain
compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to Hillrom’s named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger.
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers that are present in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is
held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the
broker is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker
does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers do not have discretionary voting
authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of shares
of Hillrom common stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, then those shares will
not be present in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of remote communication,
virtually, or by proxy at the special meeting. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve the merger agreement and will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal. For shares of Hillrom common stock held in “street name,”
only shares of common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement will be

If your shares are held in “street name” and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your broker may vote your
shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters. Under NYSE rules,
all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are held in street
name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will
not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a

If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held
by means of remote communication, virtually, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note that if your
shares of Hillrom common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the special
meeting, you must bring to the special meeting a proxy from the record holder (your broker, bank or other nominee) of
the shares of Hillrom common stock authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.
You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by returning the proxy
card by mail, through the Internet, or by telephone. Although Hillrom offers four different voting methods, Hillrom
encourages you to vote over the Internet or by phone as Hillrom believes they are the most cost-effective methods.
We also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the special meeting, so that
the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective and
reliable alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares over the Internet or by
telephone, there is no need for you to mail back your proxy card.
To Vote Over the Internet:
To vote over the Internet, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote over the Internet, you do
not have to mail in a proxy card.
To Vote by Telephone:
To vote by telephone, follow the instructions printed on your proxy card. If you vote by telephone, you do not have
to mail in a proxy card.
To Vote by Proxy Card:
To vote by proxy card, complete and sign the proxy card and mail it to the address indicated on the proxy card.
If you sign and return your signed proxy card without indicating how you want your shares of Hillrom common stock
to be voted with regard to a particular proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the proposal to
approve the merger agreement but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment proposal or the named executive
officer merger-related compensation proposal, your shares of Hillrom common stock will be voted in favor of each
such proposal. Proxy cards that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the special meeting
and cannot be voted.
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive a form from your broker, bank or other
nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker, bank or other
nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke your instructions.

Revocation of Proxies
Any proxy given by a Hillrom shareholder may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by
doing any of the following:
•
if a proxy was submitted by telephone or through the Internet, by submitting another proxy by telephone or
through the Internet, in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card at any time before your proxy is
exercised at the special meeting;
•
by submitting a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares of Hillrom common stock;
•
by delivering a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to
Hillrom’s Secretary at 130 E. Randolph Street, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60601, stating that the proxy is
revoked, provided such written notice is received before your proxy is exercised at the special meeting; or
•
by attending the special meeting and voting in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by
means of remote communication, virtually (your attendance at the special meeting in person or virtually, as
applicable, will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; you must vote in person or virtually, as applicable, at the
special meeting).

In addition to the proposal to approve the merger agreement, Hillrom shareholders are also being asked to approve a
proposal that will give the Hillrom Board authority to adjourn the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time
of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement. If this proposal is approved, the special meeting could be

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Hillrom,
with Hillrom surviving the merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of Hillrom
common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded shares) will be
converted into the right to receive cash without interest in the amount of $156.00, subject to any required tax
withholding. At the effective time, all of the shares of Hillrom common stock (other than excluded shares held by a
subsidiary of Hillrom) will cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and each certificate
formerly representing any of the shares of Hillrom common stock (other than excluded shares) will thereafter
represent only the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $156.00 in cash, without interest, for each
such share. Each excluded share owned, directly or indirectly, by Hillrom, a subsidiary of Hillrom, Baxter or Merger
Sub (other than shares held on behalf of third parties) will cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to
exist without payment of any consideration.

"Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc._20211020_DEFM14A_19594022_4314928.Pdf",Effects on Hillrom if the Merger Is Not Completed,"Effects on Hillrom if the Merger Is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not approved by the Hillrom shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other
reason, Hillrom shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead,
Hillrom will remain an independent public company. In addition, if the merger is not completed, Hillrom expects that
management will operate Hillrom’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that
Hillrom shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently
subject, including, without limitation, risks related to the competitive industry in which Hillrom operates and adverse
economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger
not to be completed, it is possible that the price of Hillrom common stock will decline significantly. If that were to
occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Hillrom common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of
the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares of Hillrom common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Hillrom
Board will continue to evaluate and review Hillrom’s business operations, properties, dividend policy and
capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to identify
strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. If the merger agreement is not approved by the Hillrom
shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other
transaction acceptable to Hillrom will be offered or that Hillrom’s business, prospects or results of operation will not
be adversely impacted.
In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, Hillrom may be required to pay
Baxter a termination fee in an amount equal to $367 million. The merger agreement also provides that Baxter may be
required to pay Hillrom a termination fee equal to $420 million upon termination under certain specified circumstances.

Payable by Baxter.”

Over the years, in the ordinary course of business, as part of our ongoing consideration and evaluation of our long-
term strategic goals and plans, the Hillrom Board and Hillrom’s senior management have periodically reviewed,
considered and assessed our priorities, operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions,
as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. These reviews have included, among other items, the
consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic
alternatives, as compared to the benefits and risks of continued operation as a standalone company, and have
sometimes included outside financial and legal advisors.
25TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 16, 2021, José (Joe) E. Almeida, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Baxter, placed a phone call
to John P. Groetelaars, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hillrom. In that phone conversation, Mr. Almeida
indicated that Baxter would be interested in acquiring Hillrom in an all-cash transaction for $144 per share and that
following that telephone call, Mr. Almeida would be sending a letter to Mr. Groetelaars outlining the Baxter proposal.
Mr. Groetelaars informed Mr. Almeida that he would discuss the proposal with the Hillrom Board.
Following the telephone call, Mr. Almeida emailed a letter to Mr. Groetelaars containing a non-binding indication of
interest (the “July 16 Letter”) for Baxter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock at a value of
$144 per share in cash. The July 16 Letter noted, among other things, that Baxter’s proposal was subject to the
satisfactory completion of due diligence as well as the negotiation and execution of a merger agreement and other
related documentation. The July 16 Letter also stated that the transaction would not be subject to a financing
condition.
Following receipt of the July 16 Letter, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference on July 18, 2021 during
which members of Hillrom’s senior management, representatives of Hillrom’s financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, and
representatives of Hillrom’s legal counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”), were present. At the
meeting, Mr. Groetelaars described the July 16 Letter, which was provided to the Hillrom Board in advance of the
meeting, as well as the July 16, 2021 telephone call that he had received from Mr. Almeida in connection with the July
16 Letter. The Hillrom Board discussed the proposal contained in the July 16, 2021 Letter, including in the context of
Hillrom’s standalone plan and the current economic environment. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided an
overview of the Hillrom Board’s fiduciary duties in the context of the Hillrom Board’s consideration of a proposal to
acquire Hillrom. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an overview of the current market landscape and
Hillrom’s performance, and described the actions that Goldman Sachs could take, with the assistance of Hillrom’s
management, to assist the Hillrom Board in assessing the proposal. The Hillrom Board discussed potential next steps
and directed management to work with Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton to evaluate the proposal from financial
and legal perspectives.
On July 19, 2021, Mr. Groetelaars emailed a letter to Mr. Almeida stating that the Hillrom Board would carefully review
and consider the July 16 Letter, including with the assistance of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, and stating that
the Hillrom Board would respond to the July 16 Letter once it was prepared to do so.
On July 23, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of Hillrom’s
senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. At the meeting, members of Hillrom
senior management reviewed and discussed Hillrom’s long-range outlook and financial plan, including preliminary
proposed projections prepared by management for discussion and review with the Hillrom Board. Following this
review, the Hillrom Board further discussed the July 16 Letter and potential responses, as well as Baxter’s corporate
culture and the potential contribution of the fit of the two companies’ corporate cultures and respective stakeholders
to successfully completing the possible transaction.
On July 25, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of Hillrom’s
senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. Members of Hillrom’s senior
management reviewed with the Hillrom Board management’s final projections of Hillrom’s long-range financial plan,
which reflected input from members of the Hillrom Board and members of Hillrom’s senior management following the
discussion of such plan at the prior meeting on July 23, 2021. These projections are more fully described in “-Certain
Unaudited Financial Projections.” Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Hillrom Board their
preliminary financial analysis of the proposal contained in the July 16 Letter, including their analysis of Baxter’s
potential financing plan and Baxter’s overall ability to pay in an acquisition of Hillrom. Following this discussion,
members of the Hillrom Board further discussed the proposal and potential responses, including in the context of
Hillrom’s standalone plan, as well as potential short- and long-term execution and strategic risks to Hillrom’s long-
range financial plan on a standalone basis. Following these discussions, the Hillrom Board determined that the $144
price per share was inadequate to warrant further discussion of the proposal set forth in the July 16 Letter. The
Hillrom Board then authorized Mr. Groetelaars to meet with Mr. Almeida to inform him that the $144 price per share
was inadequate and that if Baxter wished to have further discussions with Hillrom regarding a potential transaction,
Baxter would need to materially improve the value of its proposal.
On July 27, 2021, Mr. Groetelaars met in person with Mr. Almeida in the Chicago, Illinois area. At this meeting, Mr.
Groetelaars conveyed the Hillrom Board’s conclusion that, while a combination of Hillrom and Baxter could make
strategic sense, the proposal set forth in the July 16 Letter undervalued Hillrom, and that Hillrom was unwilling
26
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to engage in discussions with Baxter at the $144 per share price that Baxter had proposed. Mr. Groetelaars informed
Mr. Almeida that if Baxter wished to pursue a transaction with Hillrom, it would need to materially improve the value
of its proposal. Mr. Almeida asked Mr. Groetelaars to provide guidance on Hillrom’s valuation, including to provide
certain confidential information to assist with Baxter’s valuation. Mr. Groetelaars reiterated that Hillrom was unwilling
to share any such information or engage in further discussions based on the proposal contained in the July 16 Letter.
On July 28, 2021, Bloomberg published an article reporting market rumors that Hillrom and Baxter had been engaged
in discussions regarding a potential transaction and that Hillrom had rejected an offer from Baxter of $144 per share of
Hillrom common stock. Other news agencies published similar news articles on July 28, 2021.
Later on July 28, 2021, Mr. Almeida called Mr. Groetelaars and stated that Baxter was increasing its proposal to $148
per share in cash, and that following their telephone call, Mr. Almeida would be sending a letter to Mr. Groetelaars
outlining the revised proposal. Mr. Groetelaars told Mr. Almeida that he would discuss the updated proposal with the
Hillrom Board.
Following the telephone call, Mr. Almeida emailed a letter to Mr. Groetelaars containing the updated non-binding
indication of interest (the “July 28 Letter”) for Baxter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock
at a value of $148 per share in cash. The proposal set forth in the July 28 Letter otherwise included substantially the
same terms as the proposal set forth in the July 16 Letter. The July 28 Letter also attached a draft confidentiality
agreement.
On July 29, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of Hillrom’s
senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Groetelaars provided an
overview of recent events, including the Bloomberg article and other reports from the day before, as well as his
recent communications with Mr. Almeida, including the revised proposal contained in the July 28 Letter (which letter
was provided to the Hillrom Board in advance of the meeting) to acquire Hillrom for $148 per share in cash, and Mr.
Almeida’s request to review certain Hillrom confidential information. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell
Lipton summarized the key terms of the revised proposal and potential responses, which the Hillrom Board
discussed. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an updated preliminary financial analysis of the revised
proposal and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Hillrom Board its legal obligations in connection
with its consideration of the July 28 Letter. Following these discussions, the Hillrom Board determined that the $148
price per share contained in the July 28 Letter was inadequate to warrant further discussions with Baxter regarding
the proposal set forth in the July 28 Letter, and that Mr. Groetelaars should inform Mr. Almeida that, while the Hillrom
Board understood the potential strategic value of a combination between Hillrom and Baxter, Baxter would need to
materially improve the value of its proposal to warrant further discussion.
On July 30, 2021, Mr. Groetelaars called Mr. Almeida and conveyed the message that the Hillrom Board remained open
to a transaction that was in the best interests of Hillrom and its shareholders, including one with Baxter, but that it
would not engage with Baxter on a transaction that undervalued Hillrom. Mr. Groetelaars informed Mr. Almeida that
the Hillrom Board had carefully reviewed the proposal contained in the July 28 Letter with its outside financial and
legal advisors, and had concluded that the proposal significantly undervalued Hillrom and did not provide a basis for
further discussions or the sharing of confidential information with Baxter, and that it would only do so if Baxter
proposed a transaction that fairly valued Hillrom for the Hillrom Board to consider. After the phone call, Mr.
Groetelaars emailed Mr. Almeida a letter summarizing the position of the Hillrom Board that he had conveyed to Mr.
Almeida during the telephone call.
On August 1, 2021, Mr. Almeida called Mr. Groetelaars and stated that Baxter was increasing its offer to $154 per
share in cash, and that following their telephone call, Mr. Almeida would be sending a letter to Mr. Groetelaars
outlining the further revised proposal. Mr. Almeida also reiterated his request that Hillrom provide certain confidential
information for Baxter’s review. Mr. Groetelaars informed Mr. Almeida that he would discuss the updated proposal
with the Hillrom Board.
Following the telephone call, Mr. Almeida emailed a letter to Mr. Groetelaars containing the updated non-binding
indication of interest (the “August 1 Letter”) for Baxter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common
stock at a value of $154 per share in cash. The proposal contained in the August 1 Letter otherwise reflected
substantially the same terms as the proposals set forth in the July 16 Letter and the July 28 Letter. The August 1
substantially the same terms as the proposals set forth in the July 16 Letter and the July 28 Letter. The August 1
Letter also attached a draft confidentiality agreement, identical to the draft confidentiality agreement attached to the
July 28 Letter.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 1, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of
Hillrom’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Groetelaars provided
an overview of his recent communications with Mr. Almeida, including the revised proposal contained in the August
1 Letter (which letter was provided to the Hillrom Board in advance of the meeting) to acquire Hillrom for $154 per
share in cash, and Mr. Almeida’s request to review certain Hillrom confidential information, including potentially in a
meeting that would be attended by members of senior management of Hillrom and Baxter. Mr. Groetelaars also
informed the Hillrom Board that while he thought it might be possible for Baxter to improve its $154 per share offer, he
believed, based on the position Mr. Almeida had conveyed in their most recent discussion, that Baxter would be
unlikely to do so without access to confidential information in a management meeting. Representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Wachtell Lipton summarized the key terms of the revised proposal and potential responses, which the
Hillrom Board then discussed. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an updated preliminary financial analysis
of the revised proposal and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Hillrom Board its legal obligations.
Following these discussions, the Hillrom Board determined to authorize management to provide certain confidential
information to Baxter through a management meeting in order to determine whether Baxter would increase its
proposed purchase price.
Following the meeting of the Hillrom Board, Mr. Groetelaars contacted Mr. Almeida to state that the Hillrom Board
had authorized a meeting between senior management of both Hillrom and Baxter, where Hillrom would provide
certain limited non-public information regarding Hillrom via a management presentation, with the understanding that
Baxter would be expected to improve the value of its proposed $154 price per share contained in the August 1 Letter,
and that the Hillrom Board was not prepared to support a transaction at a price per share of $154. Mr. Groetelaars and
Mr. Almeida agreed to schedule the meeting for August 4, 2021 in the Chicago, Illinois area.
Between August 1, 2021 and August 3, 2021, Hillrom and Baxter negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement,
with representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Baxter’s legal counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP (“Sullivan & Cromwell”),
participating in such negotiations. On August 3, 2021, Hillrom and Baxter entered into the confidentiality agreement,
which included a customary standstill provision.
On August 4, 2021, members of Hillrom’s senior management met in person with members of Baxter’s senior
management. At the meeting, senior management of Hillrom provided senior management of Baxter with additional
information regarding Hillrom’s business, potential areas of value and the development of its Connected Care
portfolio, and Baxter described its vision for the proposed combined business.
On August 6, 2021, Mr. Almeida called Mr. Groetelaars and informed him that Baxter was willing to increase its offer to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock for $156 per share in cash. Mr. Almeida informed Mr.
Groetelaars that the $156 per share price represented Baxter’s “best and final” offer, and that if it was insufficient to
warrant further discussions, then Baxter would no longer pursue the potential transaction with Hillrom. Mr.
Groetelaars told Mr. Almeida that he would discuss the updated proposal with the Hillrom Board.
On August 9, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of
Hillrom’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities (who the Hillrom Board
determined to retain to act as an additional financial advisor) and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Groetelaars provided an
overview of recent events, including the August 4, 2021 management meeting with members of Baxter’s senior
management and his recent communications with Mr. Almeida, including the revised proposal to acquire Hillrom for
$156 per share in cash, and the fact that Mr. Almeida had conveyed that the $156 per share price represented Baxter’s
best and final offer. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton summarized the key terms of the revised
proposal and potential responses, which the Hillrom Board then discussed. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and
BofA Securities provided preliminary financial analyses of the revised proposal, including their respective analyses
of Baxter’s overall ability to pay in an acquisition of Hillrom, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with
the Hillrom Board its legal obligations. The Hillrom Board discussed the revised proposal, including in comparison to
Hillrom’s standalone prospects and the current market environment, as well as whether other potential bidders would
be capable of offering, and willing to offer, a greater value than Baxter’s $156 per share all-cash proposal. Members of
the Hillrom Board also discussed that Hillrom had not received any proposals to acquire Hillrom or engage in an
extraordinary transaction from any parties (other than Baxter) following the July 28, 2021 Bloomberg story regarding
rumors of the transaction discussions between Hillrom and Baxter.
After discussion, including consultation with representatives of Goldman Sachs and BofA Securities regarding the
likelihood of potential competing bidders and after considering the risk of additional leaks and delays, including
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the potential impact on Baxter’s proposal, the Hillrom Board determined not to contact third parties to solicit
alternative proposals at that time. Following these discussions, the Hillrom Board authorized members of Hillrom
senior management to negotiate a transaction with Baxter based on the $156 per share all-cash purchase price, but
determined that approval of any such transaction would be subject to acceptable terms regarding (1) transaction
certainty, (2) sufficient flexibility to operate Hillrom’s business between the signing of definitive documentation and
closing of the transaction, (3) the ability of Hillrom to consider alternative proposals prior to shareholder approval of
the transaction, and under certain circumstances, terminate any definitive agreement with Baxter to enter into a
superior proposal, and (4) Hillrom being provided with the flexibility necessary to retain its employees during the
period between signing and closing.
Following the meeting of the Hillrom Board, Mr. Groetelaars contacted Mr. Almeida to state that the Hillrom Board
had authorized him to provide additional confidential information of Hillrom to Baxter and to negotiate a transaction
with Baxter at the $156 per share all-cash purchase price previously conveyed orally by Mr. Almeida on August 6,
2021, subject to alignment on the four matters described above. Mr. Almeida stated that he was confident that the
two parties and their advisors would be able to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement, including on those four
key points. Mr. Groetelaars and Mr. Almeida agreed to target the completion of documentation and the
announcement of a transaction in late August or early September. Mr. Almeida also informed Mr. Groetelaars that
Sullivan & Cromwell had prepared a draft merger agreement and would share the draft with Wachtell Lipton.
Later on August 9, 2021, Mr. Almeida emailed a letter to Mr. Groetelaars containing the proposal (the “August 9
Baxter Letter”) for Baxter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock at a value of $156 per share
in cash. The August 9 Baxter Letter reiterated that the $156 offer was Baxter’s best and final offer.
Additionally, following receipt of the August 9 Baxter Letter, Mr. Groetelaars emailed a letter to Mr. Almeida
summarizing their telephone call from earlier that day and stating that the Hillrom Board’s decision to pursue a
transaction with Baxter at the $156 per share price was subject to acceptable resolution of the four key issues that Mr.
Groetelaars had identified to Mr. Almeida during their telephone call.
On August 9, 2021, Sullivan & Cromwell provided an initial draft of the proposed merger agreement to Wachtell
Lipton. Between August 9, 2021 and September 1, 2021, Mr. Groetelaars and Mr. Almeida, as well as Hillrom and
Baxter’s respective management teams and legal and financial advisors, engaged in extensive negotiations regarding
the terms of the proposed merger agreement, including the parties’ required efforts to obtain regulatory approvals,
Hillrom’s ability to terminate the merger agreement and accept a superior proposal, the inclusion, terms and the size of
the fees payable upon termination of the merger agreement, Hillrom’s obligations with respect to the conduct of its
business between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger, and matters related to the
compensation and retention of Hillrom employees. During the course of these negotiations, significant areas of
discussion and negotiation between the parties included, among other things, the “deal protection” provisions of the
agreement (including the termination fee payable by Hillrom), Hillrom’s obligations with respect to the operation of its
business during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger, the
scope of the restrictions applicable to actions taken by Hillrom during the period between the signing of the merger
agreement and the consummation of the merger with respect to employee compensation and benefits and employee
retention matters, and Baxter’s obligations to obtain regulatory approvals and the termination fee payable by Baxter
in the event of failure to obtain regulatory approval.
In addition, beginning on August 12, 2021, Hillrom made available to Baxter and its representatives certain due
diligence information in a confidential data room, including the Hillrom Projections (as defined below). Thereafter,
from August 12, 2021 through September 1, 2021, Baxter, with the assistance of its advisors, conducted due diligence
on Hillrom, including through the materials made available in the confidential data room and telephone and
videoconference calls with members of Hillrom management. In order for Hillrom to provide Baxter and its
representatives access to certain sensitive information, on August 30, 2021, Hillrom and Baxter entered into an
additional confidentiality agreement pursuant to which certain sensitive information would be provided to certain
members of Baxter senior management and Baxter’s representatives only in a separate limited data room.
On August 29, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of
Hillrom’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Mr. Groetelaars provided an overview of recent developments, including updates regarding the ongoing discussions
with respect to a potential transaction with Baxter, including regarding the status of negotiations with respect to the
proposed terms of the merger agreement, the due diligence review and the timing for a potential transaction
announcement.
Later on August 29, 2021, The Wall Street Journal published an article reporting market rumors that Hillrom and
Baxter were engaged in advanced discussions regarding a potential transaction whereby Baxter would acquire
Hillrom for a price of approximately $150 per share of Hillrom common stock. Other news agencies published similar
news articles on August 29, 2021 and August 30, 2021. Additionally, on August 30, 2021, CNBC reported on market
rumors that Hillrom and Baxter were engaged in advanced discussions regarding a potential transaction whereby
Baxter would acquire Hillrom for a price of approximately $156 per share of Hillrom common stock.
On August 31, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of
Hillrom’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton. Mr.
Groetelaars provided an overview of recent events, including an update regarding the status of discussions and
negotiations of a potential transaction with Baxter since the Hillrom Board meeting held on August 29, 2021.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs and BofA Securities reviewed and discussed with the Hillrom Board, among other
matters, their financial analyses of the proposed transaction and the proposed $156 per share all-cash price to be paid
to holders of Hillrom common stock (other than excluded shares) in the proposed merger. Additionally, prior to the
meeting, Goldman Sachs had provided a relationship disclosure letter (a previous draft of which had been reviewed
by members of Hillrom senior management) to the Hillrom Board providing certain information regarding its
relationships with Hillrom and Baxter, and prior to the meeting BofA Securities had provided a relationship disclosure
letter (a previous version of which had been reviewed by members of Hillrom senior management) to the Hillrom
Board providing certain information regarding its material relationships with each of Hillrom and Baxter, each of which
letters were discussed with the Hillrom Board at the meeting. Members of Hillrom management reviewed with the
Hillrom Board the status and process of the due diligence review of Hillrom by Baxter and of the planned
communications rollout by both Hillrom and Baxter. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Hillrom
Board certain legal considerations, including the directors’ duties in connection with their consideration of the
potential transaction, and the principal terms of the draft merger agreement. Members of the Hillrom Board also
discussed that Hillrom had still not received any proposals to acquire Hillrom or engage in an extraordinary
transaction from any parties (other than Baxter) following the July 28, 2021 Bloomberg story regarding rumors of the
transaction discussions between Hillrom and Baxter or following the August 29, 2021 Wall Street Journal story
regarding rumors of the transaction discussions between Hillrom and Baxter. Following these discussions, the Hillrom
Board instructed Hillrom’s management and its advisors to continue to negotiate the terms of the potential
transaction, with a further update to be provided to the Hillrom Board at its next meeting.
Between August 31, 2021 and September 1, 2021, Hillrom’s and Baxter’s respective management teams, with the
assistance of their respective legal advisors, finalized the remaining open issues related to the merger agreement and
related transaction documents.
On September 1, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of
Hillrom’s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton. At this
time, Mr. Groetelaars informed the Hillrom Board that the remaining matters in the merger agreement had been
resolved in a manner consistent with the discussions with the Hillrom Board on the prior day. A representative of
Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 1, 2021, to the
Hillrom Board to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, the per share merger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than
Baxter and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of
Hillrom common stock. In addition, a representative of BofA Securities rendered to the Hillrom Board BofA Securities’
oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 1, 2021, to the effect that, as of
that date and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its written opinion, the per
share merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than
holders of excluded shares), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Following further discussion, during which the directors considered the matters reviewed and discussed at that
meeting and prior meetings, including factors described under the section of this proxy statement entitled “-Reasons
for the Merger,” the Hillrom Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
contemplated by the merger agreement were fair to and in the best interests of Hillrom and its shareholders, and
unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement in all respects, and recommended that Hillrom’s shareholders approve the merger agreement.
During the evening of September 1, 2021, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement. Thereafter, the
transaction was announced before the opening of the financial markets in New York on September 2, 2021, in a press
release jointly issued by Hillrom and Baxter.

In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Hillrom Board consulted with Hillrom’s management and its
outside financial and legal advisors and, in reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement, the
merger and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommend that holders of shares of Hillrom common stock
approve the merger agreement, the Hillrom Board considered a variety of factors, including the following:
•
Hillrom’s business, current and projected financial condition, earnings and prospects;
•
the Hillrom Board’s belief that the $156.00 per share merger consideration exceeds Hillrom’s likely value as a
standalone company, including taking into account Hillrom’s potential for, and risks to, future growth;
•
the anticipated future trading prices of Hillrom common stock on a standalone basis, based on management
estimates and adjusted for different scenarios, and the risks and uncertainties of continuing on a
standalone basis as an independent public company;
•
the fact that the per share merger consideration consists solely of cash, providing Hillrom shareholders
with certainty of value and liquidity upon consummation of the merger;
•
recent and historical market prices for Hillrom common stock, as compared to the per share merger
consideration, including the fact that the per share merger consideration of $156.00 per share represents an
approximate premium of:
•
26.0% to the $123.78 closing price per share of Hillrom common stock on July 27, 2021, the last trading
day prior to initial media reports speculating about a potential transaction between Hillrom and Baxter;
•
34.5% to the $115.99 price per share of Hillrom common stock based on the volume weighted average
price per share of Hillrom common stock for the thirty (30)-trading day period ended July 27, 2021;
•
92.2% to the $81.17 closing price per share of Hillrom common stock on September 24, 2020, which
represented the lowest price per share of Hillrom common stock for the fifty-two (52)-week period
ending on September 1, 2021, the last trading day before public announcement of the merger
agreement; and
•
7.5% to the $145.06 closing price per share of Hillrom common stock on September 1, 2021, the last
trading day before public announcement of the merger agreement;
•
the opinion of Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to Hillrom, that, as of September 1, 2021, and based upon
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the per share merger consideration to be paid
to the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than Baxter and its affiliates) pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Hillrom common stock,
and the financial analysis related thereto prepared by Goldman Sachs and described below under “Opinion
of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”;
•
the opinion of BofA Securities, financial advisor to Hillrom, to the effect that, as of September 1, 2021 and
based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in such opinion, the per share
merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than
holders of excluded shares), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, and the financial
analysis related thereto prepared by BofA Securities, as more fully described below under the section
entitled “Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.”;

•
the course and history of the negotiations between Hillrom and Baxter, as described under “- Background
of the Merger,” Baxter’s initial offer of $144.00 per share, which was subsequently increased to $148.00 per
share and to $154.00 per share, as well as Baxter’s offer of $156.00 per share, which the Hillrom Board and
management believed was Baxter’s best and final offer;
•
the fact that Baxter agreed to (and agreed to cause Baxter’s subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain all necessary governmental approvals with respect to the merger, including (i) agreeing to
divestitures, (ii) modifying contractual or commercial relationships and (iii) taking other actions that may
change the conduct of Baxter’s business, in each case as necessary to obtain any such approval, subject in
each case to certain limitations described under “The Merger Agreement-Required Efforts to Consummate
the Merger,” together with the fact that Baxter agreed to pay to Hillrom a $420 million termination fee under
the circumstances described under “-Termination Fee Payable by Baxter”;
•
the Hillrom Board’s belief, based on the advice of Hillrom’s financial advisors and its knowledge of the
industry and the operations of Hillrom, that it was unlikely that any other potential acquirors, including
financial sponsors and strategic buyers, would be willing and able to acquire Hillrom at a price in excess of
$156.00 per share in cash, even if Hillrom were to conduct an auction process or other solicitation of
alternative acquisition proposals;
•
the fact that there were media reports that Baxter had proposed to acquire Hillrom, which provided any third
party wishing to engage in discussions with Hillrom with an opportunity to make its interest known, and
the fact that, although the Hillrom Board had not granted Baxter exclusivity and was free to consider
indications of interest from any other party, no potential acquiror other than Baxter made a proposal to
acquire Hillrom during the six-week period between the initial media reports and the public announcement
of the merger agreement on September 2, 2021, and the Hillrom Board’s view that, if potential acquirors were
interested in exploring a transaction with Hillrom, such potential acquirors could have engaged with the
Hillrom Board or its representatives before such public announcement;
•
the Hillrom Board’s belief that the termination fee and other limitations applicable to, among other things, a
change of recommendation and alternative acquisition proposals agreed to in the merger agreement were
reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential acquirer from
submitting a proposal to acquire Hillrom following the announcement of the merger or prohibit the Hillrom
Board or its representatives from engaging with any such potential acquiror, subject to the applicable
provisions of the merger agreement;
•
the Hillrom Board’s review of the structure of the merger and the financial and other terms of the merger
agreement, including, among others, the following terms of the merger agreement:
•
the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which the Hillrom Board believed are
reasonable and customary in number and scope;
•
representations from Baxter and Merger Sub that they will have available all funds necessary for the
payment of the aggregate merger consideration, and the absence of a financing condition in the
merger agreement;
•
the ability of the Hillrom Board, subject to certain conditions, to provide information to and engage in
discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal if the
Hillrom Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a superior proposal;
•
the ability of the Hillrom Board, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation that
Hillrom shareholders approve the merger agreement and, in addition, to cause Hillrom to terminate the
merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement that constitutes a superior
proposal, if the Hillrom Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the members of the Hillrom Board; and
•
the customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Hillrom in the merger
agreement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the fact that Hillrom’s outside financial and legal advisors were involved in the negotiations and updated
the Hillrom Board directly throughout the process, which provided oversight and additional perspectives
on the negotiations in addition to those of Hillrom’s management;
•
the Hillrom Board’s belief that the complementary product offerings of Hillrom and Baxter will support
patients in the hospital, at home, and in alternate sites of care, allowing better integration and coordination
of healthcare delivery; and
•
the Hillrom Board’s belief that the combination of Hillrom and Baxter will unite two organizations that have
each been recognized for achievements in workplace diversity and corporate responsibility, and for
fostering an environment that supports and encourages high performance, respect for individuals, and
professional growth.
In the course of its deliberations, the Hillrom Board, in consultation with Hillrom’s management and Hillrom’s outside
financial and legal advisors, also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the
merger agreement and the merger, including the following:
•
the fact that, subsequent to completion of the merger, Hillrom will no longer exist as an independent public
company and that as a cash acquisition, the transaction would prevent Hillrom shareholders from being
able to participate in any value creation that Hillrom could generate going forward, as well as any future
appreciation in the value of Hillrom;
•
the covenants in the merger agreement prohibiting Hillrom from soliciting other potential acquisition
proposals, and restricting its ability to entertain other potential acquisition proposals, unless certain
conditions are satisfied, and the covenants in the merger agreement requiring Hillrom to provide Baxter with
an opportunity within four (4) business days to match any competing acquisition proposal that constitutes
a superior proposal, which could discourage potential acquirors from making a competing acquisition
proposal, although the Hillrom Board believed these covenants would not preclude an interested and able
potential acquiror from seeking to acquire Hillrom;
•
the fact that Hillrom would be obligated to pay a termination fee of $367 million under certain
circumstances, including the potential impact of such termination fee on the willingness of other potential
acquirors to propose alternative transactions, although the Hillrom Board believed that the termination fee
was reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential acquiror
from submitting a proposal to acquire Hillrom following the announcement of the merger;
•
the fact that Baxter’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the merger are subject to regulatory
approvals and other conditions, and the possibility that such conditions may not be satisfied, including as
a result of events outside of Hillrom’s control, and the fact that, if the merger is not consummated:
•
Hillrom’s directors, officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will
have experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the transaction, and
Hillrom will have incurred significant transaction costs attempting to consummate the transaction;
•
the market’s perception of Hillrom’s continuing business could potentially result in a loss of
customers, suppliers, distributors, business partners, collaboration partners and employees; and
•
the trading price of Hillrom common stock could be adversely affected;
•
the potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on Hillrom’s business and relationships with
customers, suppliers, distributors, business partners, collaboration partners and employees, including the
risk that certain key members of Hillrom management might choose not to remain employed with Hillrom
prior to the completion of the merger, regardless of whether or not the merger is completed;
•
the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Hillrom has agreed that it will use reasonable best
efforts to carry on its business in all material respects in the ordinary course, and, subject to specified
exceptions, that Hillrom will not take a number of actions related to the conduct of its business without
Baxter’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the
possibility these terms may limit the ability of Hillrom to pursue business opportunities that it would
otherwise pursue, including potential acquisitions, investments and other strategic opportunities;

•
the fact that certain of Hillrom’s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are
different from, and in addition to, those of Hillrom’s other shareholders. See “The Merger-Interests of
Hillrom’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger;”
•
the fact that Hillrom has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in
connection with the proposed transaction, regardless of whether the merger is consummated;
•
the fact that the exchange of Hillrom common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.
After considering the foregoing potentially negative and potentially positive factors, the Hillrom Board concluded
that the potentially positive factors substantially outweighed the potentially negative factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Hillrom Board is not exhaustive, but is
intended to reflect the material factors considered by the Hillrom Board in its consideration of the merger. In view of
the complexity and the large number of the factors considered, the Hillrom Board, both individually and collectively,
did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various factors. Rather, the Hillrom Board based its
recommendation on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual members
of the Hillrom Board may have given different weights to different factors. The above factors are not presented in any
order of priority. The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Hillrom Board is forward-
looking in nature. This information should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Hillrom Board that, as of September 1, 2021, and based upon and subject
to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the per share merger consideration to be paid to the holders of
shares of Hillrom common stock (other than Baxter and its affiliates), pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such holders of shares of Hillrom common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated September 1, 2021, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance
of Hillrom Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a
recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Hillrom common stock should vote with respect to the merger, or
any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman
Sachs reviewed, among other things:
•
the merger agreement;
•
annual reports to shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Hillrom for the five (5) fiscal years
ended September 30, 2020;
•
certain interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Hillrom;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Hillrom;
•
certain other communications from Hillrom to its shareholders; and
•
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Hillrom standalone prepared by its management, in each
case, as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by Hillrom, which are referred to as the “Hillrom Projections.”
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Hillrom regarding their assessment
of the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business
34TABLE OF CONTENTS
operations, financial condition, and future prospects of Hillrom; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for
shares of Hillrom common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for Hillrom with similar
financial and stock market information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded;
reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the medical technology industry and in other
industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Hillrom’s consent, relied upon and assumed the
accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to,
discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that
regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Hillrom’s consent that the Hillrom Projections were reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Hillrom. Goldman Sachs
did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative
or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Hillrom or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any
such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected
benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or
condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Hillrom to engage in the merger, or the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Hillrom; nor does it
address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not
solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, Hillrom or any
other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to
the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than Baxter and its affiliates), as of the date of the opinion, of
the per share merger consideration to be paid to such holders of shares of Hillrom common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or
aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including the
fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Hillrom; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Hillrom, or class of such
persons, in connection with the merger, whether relative to the per share merger consideration to be paid to the
holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than Baxter and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement or
otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any opinion as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit,
financial and stock markets on Hillrom, Baxter or the merger, or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or
viability of Hillrom or Baxter or the ability of Hillrom or Baxter to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other conditions, as in effect on,
and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility
for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the
date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors
of Hillrom in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not
purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of
analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the
summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together
with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is
based on market data as it existed on or before August 30, 2021 and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions.
Implied Premia and Multiples Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied premia and implied
multiples described below based on the $156.00 in cash per share of Hillrom common stock to be paid to holders
(other than Baxter and its affiliates) of shares of Hillrom common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Goldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $156.00 in cash per share of Hillrom common stock
relative to:
•
$123.78, the closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock on July 27, 2021 (the “Undisturbed
Share Price”);
•
$145.78, the closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock on August 30, 2021 (the “August 30,
2021 Share Price”);
•
$144.00, the closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock on July 15, 2021, the day Baxter
initially approached Hillrom (the “Initial Approach Share Price”);
•
$123.78, the highest closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock over the fifty-two (52)-week
period ended July 27, 2021 (“52-Week High”);
•
$115.99, the volume weighted average price per share (“VWAP”) of Hillrom common stock over the thirty
(30)-trading-day period ended July 27, 2021 (“30-Day VWAP”);
•
$113.44, the VWAP of Hillrom common stock over the sixty (60)-trading-day period ended August, 2021
(“60-Day VWAP”); and
•
$81.17, the lowest closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock over the fifty-two (52)-week
period ended July 27, 2021 (“52-Week Low”).
The results of these calculations and comparisons are as follows:

In addition, Goldman Sachs calculated an implied equity value of Hillrom for purposes of calculating the following
multiples by multiplying the $156.00 in cash per share of Hillrom common stock by the total number of fully diluted
outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock as of August 26, 2021, as provided by the management of Hillrom.
Goldman Sachs then calculated an implied enterprise value of Hillrom by adding to the implied equity value it
calculated the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021, pro forma for the incurrence of $375.0 million of incremental
debt and use of $36.4 million of cash from Hillrom’s balance sheet in connection with the acquisition of Bardy
Diagnostics, Inc. (“BardyDx”), in each case as provided by the management of Hillrom.
Using the foregoing, Goldman Sachs calculated the implied enterprise value for Hillrom as a multiple of Hillrom’s
projected Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal years 2021 to 2022 as set forth in the Hillrom Projections and the last twelve
(12) months (“LTM”) ended June 30, 2021 as provided by the management of Hillrom. For purposes of this section,
“Adjusted EBITDA” means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude
acquisition and integration costs and related fair value adjustments, field corrective actions, regulatory compliance
costs and special charges.
The results of these calculations are as follows:
Implied Enterprise Value as a Multiple of:
Multiples
LTM ending June 30, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA

Fiscal Year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA (estimated)
18.8x
Fiscal Year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA (estimated)

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Hillrom Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted
cash flow analysis on Hillrom. Using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting estimates of
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Hillrom’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2021 (i)
estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Hillrom for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 through the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year 2031 as reflected in the Hillrom Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Hillrom,
which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 2.0%, to a terminal year estimate of
the free cash flow to be generated by Hillrom, as reflected in the Hillrom Projections (which analysis implied exit
terminal year next-twelve (12)-month (“NTM”) EBITDA multiples ranging from 9.6x to 13.1x). Goldman Sachs derived
such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific
inputs, including the company’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on
permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain
financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated
by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Hillrom Projections and
market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs
calculated such NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples using NTM Adjusted EBITDA as of September 30, 2031, as
provided by the management of Hillrom.
Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Hillrom by adding the ranges of present values it
derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Hillrom
the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021, pro forma for the acquisition of BardyDx, as provided by the management
of Hillrom, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Hillrom. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of
illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock, as
provided by the management of Hillrom, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Hillrom common
stock ranging from $137 to $187, rounded to the nearest dollar.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the
implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of Hillrom common stock. For this analysis, Goldman
Sachs used the Hillrom Projections for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024.
Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied values per share of Hillrom common stock as of September 30 for each of
the fiscal years 2021 to 2023, by applying enterprise value to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 13.0x to 15.0x
Adjusted EBITDA per share of Hillrom common stock as of the end of each fiscal year from 2021 to 2023. These
illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience,
taking into account Hillrom’s historical NTM trading multiples over time. Goldman Sachs then discounted the derived
values back to Hillrom’s June 30, 2021 using an illustrative discount rate of 7.9%, reflecting an estimate of Hillrom’s
cost of equity, including the present value of projected dividends paid, as provided by the management of Hillrom.
Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States
financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Hillrom common
stock of $109 to $155, rounded to the nearest dollar.
Premia Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia
for all transactions announced during the time period from August 30, 2016 through August 30, 2021 involving a
public company target based in the United States in any industry (excluding biotech) where the disclosed enterprise
values for the transactions were greater than $10 billion.
For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and
75th percentile premiums of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock
price prior to announcement of the merger. This analysis indicated a median premium of 29% across the period. This
analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 17% and 75th percentile premium of 39% across the period. Using
this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 17% to 39% to the undisturbed
closing price per share of Hillrom common stock of $123.78 as of July 27, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity
values per share of Hillrom common stock of $145 to $172, rounded to the nearest dollar.
For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs also calculated the median, 25th percentile
and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target’s 52-Week High prior to the
announcement of the merger. This analysis indicated a median premium of 9% across the period. This analysis also
indicated a 25th percentile premium of 2% and 75th percentile premium of 22% across the period. Using this analysis,
Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 2% to 22% to the undisturbed closing price per
share of Hillrom common stock of $123.78 as of July 27, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share
of Hillrom common stock of $126 to $151, rounded to the nearest dollar.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selected Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected
transactions in the medical technology industry since 2014. For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs
calculated and compared the implied enterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration
paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA based on information in public
filings, press releases and investor relations documents. While none of the companies that participated in the
selected transactions are directly comparable to Hillrom, the companies that participated in the selected transactions
are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Hillrom’s
results, market size and product profile.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs’ analyses of the selected transactions and its
professional judgment, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of enterprise value to LTM Adjusted EBITDA
multiples of 14.1x to 21.2x to Hillrom’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2021, as provided by the management of
Hillrom, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for Hillrom. Goldman Sachs then subtracted the net debt of
Hillrom as of June 30, 2021, pro forma for the acquisition of BardyDx, as provided by the management of Hillrom, and
divided the result by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock as of August 26, 2021,
as provided by the management of Hillrom, to derive a reference range of implied values per share of Hillrom common
stock of $105 to $172, rounded to the nearest dollar.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.
No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Hillrom or Baxter or
the contemplated merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the Hillrom Board
as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than Baxter
and its affiliates), as of the date of the opinion, of the per share merger consideration to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are
not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors
or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Hillrom, Baxter, Goldman Sachs or
any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The per share merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Hillrom and Baxter
and was approved by the Hillrom Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Hillrom during these negotiations.
Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to Hillrom or the Hillrom Board or
that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Hillrom Board was one of many factors taken into consideration
by the Hillrom Board in making its determination to approve and adopt the merger agreement. The foregoing summary
does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the
fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as
Annex B.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and
trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various
persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in
which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold
or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit
default swaps and other financial instruments of Hillrom, Baxter, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or
any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman
Sachs acted as financial advisor to Hillrom in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading
to, the merger. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial advisor to Hillrom in connection with, and has participated in
certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger. Goldman Sachs expects to receive fees for its services in
connection with the merger, all of which are contingent upon consummation of the merger, and Hillrom has agreed to
reimburse certain of Goldman Sachs’ expenses arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that
may arise, out of its engagement, as described below. Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial advisory
and/or underwriting services to Hillrom and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking
Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as book runner with
respect to Hillrom’s 4.375% Senior Notes due 2027 (aggregate principal amount $425,000,000) in September 2019.
During the two (2) year period ended September 1, 2021, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial
advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Hillrom and/or its affiliates of
approximately $3.2 million. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services
to Baxter and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has
received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a co-manager with respect to Baxter’s 1.73%
Senior Notes due 2031 (aggregate principal amount $650,000,000) in October 2020; and a book runner with respect to
each of Baxter’s 3.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (aggregate principal amount $750,000,000) and 3.95% Senior Notes due
2030 (aggregate principal amount $500,000,000) in March 2020. During the two (2) year period ended September 1,
2021, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by
its Investment Banking Division to Baxter and/or its affiliates of approximately $2.1 million. Goldman Sachs may also
in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Hillrom, Baxter and their respective affiliates
for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.
The Hillrom Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter
agreement dated August 25, 2021, Hillrom engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with
the possible sale of all or a portion of Hillrom. The engagement letter between Hillrom and Goldman Sachs provides
for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the merger agreement, at
approximately $86 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, Hillrom has
agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to
indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal
securities laws.",42,47

Hillrom retained BofA Securities to act as a financial advisor to Hillrom in connection with the merger. BofA Securities
is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses
and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. Hillrom selected
BofA Securities to act as a financial advisor to Hillrom in connection with the merger on the basis of BofA Securities’
experience in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with
Hillrom and its business.
On September 1, 2021, at a meeting of the Hillrom Board held to evaluate the merger, representatives of BofA
Securities delivered to the Hillrom Board the oral opinion of BofA Securities, which was confirmed by delivery of
39TABLE OF CONTENTS
a written opinion dated September 1, 2021, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject
to various assumptions and limitations described in the written opinion, the per share merger consideration to be
received in the merger by holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than holders of excluded shares), was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion to the Hillrom Board, which describes, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of
BofA Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the written opinion. BofA
Securities delivered its opinion to the Hillrom Board for the benefit and use of the Hillrom Board (in its capacity as
such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the per share merger consideration from a financial
point of view. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect or implications of the merger and no
opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to Hillrom or in which Hillrom might engage or as to the underlying business
decision of Hillrom to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Securities’ opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Securities has, among other things:
(1)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Hillrom;
(2)
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and
prospects of Hillrom furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the management of Hillrom,
including the Hillrom Projections;
(3)
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Hillrom with
members of senior management of Hillrom;
(4)
reviewed the trading history for Hillrom common stock and a comparison of that trading history with the
trading histories of other companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;
(5)
compared certain financial and stock market information of Hillrom with similar information of other
companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;
(6)
compared certain financial terms of the merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other
transactions BofA Securities deemed relevant;
(7)
reviewed the merger agreement; and
(8)
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA
Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of the management of Hillrom that it is not aware of
any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect.
With respect to the Hillrom Projections, BofA Securities was advised by Hillrom, and assumed, that they were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the
management of Hillrom as to the future financial performance of Hillrom. BofA Securities did not make and was not
provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Hillrom
or any other entity, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Hillrom or any other entity.
BofA Securities also did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Hillrom or any other entity under any state, federal
or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities assumed, at the direction of
Hillrom, that the merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger, no delay, limitation,
restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed
that would have an adverse effect on Hillrom, Baxter, any other entity or Merger (including the contemplated benefits
thereof).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the merger (other
than the per share merger consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation,
the form or structure of the merger or any terms, aspects or implications of any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into in connection with or related to the merger or otherwise. BofA Securities was not
requested to, and did not, solicit indications of interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible
acquisition of all or any part of Hillrom or any alternative transaction. BofA Securities’ opinion was limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of Hillrom
common stock (other than holders of excluded shares) and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any
consideration received in connection with the merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or
otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or
employees of any party to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the per share merger consideration or
otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to
other strategies or transactions that might be available to Hillrom or in which Hillrom might engage or as to the
underlying business decision of Hillrom to proceed with or effect the merger. In addition, BofA Securities did not
express any view or opinion with respect to, and it relied, with the consent of Hillrom, upon the assessments of
Hillrom and its representatives regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Hillrom or
any other entity and the merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof) as to which it understood that Hillrom
obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. BofA Securities further expressed no
opinion or recommendation as to how any shareholder should vote or act in connection with the merger or any other
matter.
BofA Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and
circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Securities as of the date of its opinion. It
should be understood that subsequent developments may affect BofA Securities’ opinion, and BofA Securities does
not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities’ opinion was
approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities, Inc. Except as described in this summary,
Hillrom imposed no other instructions or limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by BofA
Securities in rendering its opinion.
The discussion set forth below in the section entitled “Summary of Material Company Financial Analyses”
represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Hillrom Board in
connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular
format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the tables must be read
together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses performed by BofA Securities. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the
full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, the enterprise values for each of the selected companies and for
Hillrom, calculated by multiplying the closing share price of each applicable company on August 30, 2021 (and with
respect to Hillrom, by multiplying each of (i) the per share merger consideration and (ii) the closing share price of
Hillrom on July 27, 2021 (the “Unaffected Price”), the day before The Wall Street Journal reported that Hillrom and
Baxter were discussing an acquisition of Hillrom by Baxter) by the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding of the
applicable company (determined on a treasury stock method basis), and adding to (or subtracting from, as applicable)
the result the amount of the applicable company’s net debt (or net cash) (defined as debt, preferred equity and non-
controlling interest (as applicable) less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (as applicable)), as a multiple
of Wall Street analyst consensus estimates of calendar year 2021 and 2022 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the applicable company (referred to in this section as “2021E EV /
EBITDA” and “2022E EV / EBITDA”). Financial data and equity information of the selected companies were derived
from their public filings and publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates published by FactSet as of
August 30, 2021. Financial data of Hillrom were derived from Hillrom’s public filings and publicly available Wall Street
research analysts’ estimates published by FactSet as of August 30, 2021 and equity information provided by the
management of Hillrom. The overall low to high 2021E EV / EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies
were 9.8x to 26.3x (with a mean of 18.5x and median of 17.1x). The overall low to high 2022E EV / EBITDA multiples
observed for the selected companies were 13.3x to 22.3x (with a mean of 17.2x and median of 17.0x). BofA Securities
noted that the 2021E EV / EBITDA multiple and the 2022E EV / EBITDA multiple observed for Hillrom was 18.8x and
17.7x, respectively, based on the per share merger consideration, and 15.4x and 14.5x, respectively, based on the
Unaffected Price.
Based on BofA Securities’ review of the enterprise values to EBITDA multiples for the selected companies and
Hillrom and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied a 2021E EV / EBITDA multiple
reference range of 14.5x to 18.5x to Hillrom management’s estimates of calendar year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, as
reflected in the Hillrom Projections, and a 2022E EV / EBITDA multiple reference range of 13.0x to 17.0x to Hillrom
management’s estimates of calendar year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA as reflected in the Hillrom Projections to calculate
ranges of implied enterprise values for Hillrom. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges
per share of Hillrom common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for Hillrom by subtracting from the resulting ranges
of implied enterprise values it calculated the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021 (calculated as debt less cash, and
pro forma for Hillrom’s acquisition of Bardy Diagnostics, Inc.), as reflected in Hillrom’s public filings, and dividing the
result by a number of fully-diluted shares of Hillrom common stock outstanding (calculated on a treasury stock
method basis, based on information provided by the management of Hillrom). This analysis indicated the following
approximate implied equity value reference ranges per share of Hillrom common stock, as compared to the per share
merger consideration:
Implied Equity Value 
Reference Range per Share 
of Hillrom Common Stock
2021E Adjusted 
EBITDA
2022E Adjusted 
EBITDA
Per Share Merger 
Consideration
$117.00 - $156.75
$114.50 - $157.75
$156.00
No selected publicly traded company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Hillrom. Accordingly,
an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that
could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which Hillrom was compared.

For each of these transactions, BofA Securities reviewed the enterprise values implied for each target company based
on the consideration payable in the selected transaction, as multiples of estimates of the target company’s last twelve
(12) months EBITDA, or “LTM EBITDA”, and as multiples of estimates of the target company’s next twelve (12)
months EBITDA, or “NTM EBITDA”, in each case, as of the announcement of the relevant transaction and based on
publicly available information at that time. The overall low to high enterprise value to LTM EBITDA multiples of the
target companies in the selected transactions were 13.7x to 28.7x (with a mean of 18.4x and median of 16.6x). The
overall low to high enterprise value to NTM EBITDA multiples of the target companies in the selected transactions
were 11.0x to 27.3x (with a mean of 17.1x and median of 16.3x).
Based on BofA Securities’ review of the enterprise values to LTM EBITDA multiples and NTM EBITDA multiples for
the selected transactions and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied an enterprise
value to LTM EBITDA multiple reference range of 14.0x to 18.0x to Hillrom’s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month
period ended June 30, 2021, as reflected in Hillrom’s public filings, and an enterprise value to NTM EBITDA multiple
reference range of 11.5x to 16.5x to Hillrom management’s estimates of Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period
ending June 30, 2022, as reflected in the Hillrom Projections, to calculate a range of implied enterprise values for
Hillrom. BofA Securities then calculated an implied equity value reference range per share of Hillrom common stock
(rounded to the nearest $0.25) for Hillrom by subtracting from the resulting ranges of implied enterprise values it
calculated the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021 (calculated as debt less cash, and pro forma for Hillrom’s
acquisition of Bardy Diagnostics, Inc.), as reflected in Hillrom’s public filings, and dividing the result by a number of
fully-diluted shares of Hillrom common stock outstanding (calculated on a treasury stock method basis, based on
information provided by the management of Hillrom). This analysis indicated the following approximate implied
equity value reference ranges per share of Hillrom common stock, as compared to the per share merger consideration:
Implied Equity Value Reference Range 
per Share of Hillrom Common Stock
LTM (6/30/2021)
NTM (6/30/2022)
Per Share Merger 
Consideration
$104.25 - $141.75
$90.50 - $141.50
$156.00
No selected precedent transaction used in this analysis or the applicable business or target company is identical or
directly comparable to Hillrom or the merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely
mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics, market conditions and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other
values of the companies or transactions to which Hillrom and the merger were compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Hillrom to calculate a range of implied present values
per share of Hillrom common stock utilizing estimates of the standalone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows Hillrom
was expected to generate over the period from June 30, 2021 through September 30, 2031 based on the Hillrom
Projections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for Hillrom by applying a selected range of EBITDA exit
multiples of 10.0x to 15.0x, which were selected based on BofA Securities’ professional judgment and experience, to
estimates of the EBITDA Hillrom was expected to generate in the terminal year. The cash flows and
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the terminal values were then discounted to present value as of June 30, 2021, utilizing the mid-year convention, and
using discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 9.0%, which were based on an estimate of Hillrom’s weighted average cost
of capital, derived using the capital asset pricing model. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value
reference ranges per share of Hillrom common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for Hillrom by subtracting from the
resulting ranges of implied enterprise values it calculated the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021 (calculated as
debt less cash, and pro forma for Hillrom’s acquisition of Bardy Diagnostics, Inc.), as reflected in Hillrom’s public
filings, and dividing the result by a number of fully-diluted shares of Hillrom common stock outstanding (calculated
on a treasury stock method basis, based on information provided by the management of Hillrom). This analysis
indicated the following approximate implied equity value reference range per share of Hillrom common stock (rounded
to the nearest $0.25) for Hillrom, as compared to the per share merger consideration:
Implied Equity Value Reference 
Range per Share of Hillrom 
Common Stock
Per Share Merger Consideration
$130.50 - $208.25
$156.00
Other Factors
BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’ financial
analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things
the following:
52-Week Trading Range. BofA Securities reviewed the trading range of the shares of Hillrom common stock for the
52-week period ended July 27, 2021, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported that Hillrom and Baxter were
discussing an acquisition of Hillrom by Baxter, which was $81.17 to $123.78, and for the 52-week period ended August
30, 2021, which was $81.17 to $145.78.
Wall Street Analysts Unaffected Price Targets. BofA Securities reviewed certain publicly available equity research
analyst price targets for the shares of Hillrom common stock available as of July 27, 2021, the day before The Wall
Street Journal reported that Hillrom and Baxter were discussing an acquisition of Hillrom by Baxter, and noted that the
range of such price targets (discounted by one (1) year at Hillrom’s illustrative cost of equity of 9%) was $114.75 to
$120.25.
Wall Street Analysts Current Price Targets. BofA Securities reviewed certain publicly available equity research
analyst price targets for the shares of Hillrom common stock available as of August 30, 2021, and noted that the range
of such price targets (discounted by one (1) year at Hillrom’s illustrative cost of equity of 9%) was $119.25 to $142.25.
Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled “Summary of Material Company Financial
Analyses” represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Hillrom
Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors
considered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex
analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is
not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses
summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its
analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to
in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis
referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Hillrom. The estimates of the future
performance of Hillrom in or underlying BofA Securities analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by
BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness,
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than holders of excluded
shares) of the per share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger and were provided to the
Hillrom Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any
securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of
valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty
and should not be taken to be BofA Securities’ view of the actual values of Hillrom or its shares.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between Hillrom
and Baxter, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Hillrom Board. The decision to enter into
the merger agreement was solely that of the Hillrom Board. As described above, BofA Securities’ opinion and
analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Hillrom Board in its evaluation of the merger and should
not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Hillrom Board, management or any other party with respect to the
merger or the per share merger consideration.
Hillrom has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee of
approximately $11 million, $1.5 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion and the remainder of which
is contingent upon consummation of the merger. Hillrom also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its
expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any of its
affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents and each other person controlling BofA
Securities or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising
out of BofA Securities’ engagement.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities,
commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well
as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and financial
advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies, governments and
individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates may invest on a principal
basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions
or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Hillrom, Baxter and certain of their respective affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide,
investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Hillrom and certain of its affiliates and have
received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or
acting as an initial purchaser, underwriter and/or bookrunner for certain debt offerings of Hillrom, (ii) having acted or
acting as an arranger, bookrunner and/or syndication agent for, and/or as a lender under, certain term loans, letters of

Certain Unaudited Financial Projections",47,54
"Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc._20211020_DEFM14A_19594022_4314928.Pdf",Certain Unaudited Financial Projections,"Certain Unaudited Financial Projections
While Hillrom has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, Hillrom has not, as a matter of
course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections as to future performance, earnings or other results beyond
the then current annual period, and is especially wary of making projections for extended periods, due to, among
other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the
uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Hillrom is including in this proxy statement a
summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial information of Hillrom on a standalone basis, without
giving effect to the merger (the “Hillrom Projections”), prepared by Hillrom’s management, solely because such
financial information was given to the Hillrom Board, Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and to Baxter as described
below. Hillrom advised the recipients of the Hillrom Projections that its internal financial forecasts are subjective in
many respects. The inclusion of the Hillrom Projections or of this summary should not be regarded as an indication
that the Hillrom Board, Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities, Baxter, Hillrom or its management or any other recipient of
this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an
accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such. This information is not fact and
readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Hillrom Projections.
The Hillrom Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Hillrom Projections were based are
subjective in many respects, and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the
dynamics of Hillrom’s industry and based on actual experience and business developments. The Hillrom Projections,
while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to company performance,
industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond
Hillrom’s control. Multiple factors, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” could cause the Hillrom Projections or the
underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Hillrom Projections will be
realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. Because the Hillrom Projections
cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The Hillrom
Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were
prepared, including the merger. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an
additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Hillrom Projections will be
achieved. As a result, the inclusion of the Hillrom Projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an
admission or representation by Hillrom, Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities or any other person that the information is
material. This summary of the Hillrom Projections is not provided to influence Hillrom shareholders’ decisions
regarding whether to vote for the merger proposal or any other proposal. The Hillrom Projections should be
evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in Hillrom’s
public filings with the SEC.
The Hillrom Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information. Neither PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), Hillrom’s independent registered
public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled or performed any procedures with
respect to the Hillrom Projections, and accordingly, PwC does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
with respect thereto. The PwC report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Hillrom’s historical
financial information. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be
read to do so. Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial information does not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared.
Hillrom has not made and makes no representation to any Hillrom shareholder or to Baxter stockholder in the merger
agreement or otherwise concerning the Hillrom Projections or regarding Hillrom’s ultimate performance compared to
the information contained in the Hillrom Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. Hillrom urges all
shareholders to review Hillrom’s most recent SEC filings for a description of Hillrom’s reported financial results.
46TABLE OF CONTENTS
Hillrom’s management prepared the Hillrom Projections with respect to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2021, and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 through September 30, 2031. Hillrom’s management
provided the Hillrom Board with the Hillrom Projections in connection with the Hillrom Board’s consideration and
evaluation of a potential transaction with Baxter. In addition, the Hillrom Projections were provided to Goldman Sachs
and BofA Securities and were approved by Hillrom for use by Goldman Sachs and BofA Securities for purposes of
their respective financial analyses and opinions as discussed in the sections entitled “Opinion of Goldman Sachs &
Co. LLC” and “Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.” The Hillrom Projections were also provided to Baxter in connection
with its consideration and evaluation of the merger. The summary of the Hillrom Projections included in this proxy
statement are presented to give Hillrom shareholders access to the financial projections that were made available to
the Hillrom Board, Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and to Baxter.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude acquisition
and integration costs and related fair value adjustments, field corrective actions, regulatory compliance costs and special charges.
(2)
Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating Income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to exclude acquisition
and integration costs and related fair value adjustments, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, field corrective actions,
regulatory compliance costs and special charges.
(3)
Unlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted Operating Income plus depreciation and amortization (excluding acquisition-
related asset amortization) less capital expenditures and changes in net working capital plus the tax shield attributable to
acquisition related asset amortization.
In addition, for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ and BofA Securities’ financial analyses described in the sections entitled
“Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC” and “Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.,” Hillrom’s management provided
Goldman Sachs and BofA Securities with, and approved for their use, an estimate of Hillrom’s LTM Adjusted
EBITDA, defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021, of $632 million and an
estimate of Hillrom’s NTM Adjusted EBITDA, defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve (12)-month period ending
June 30, 2022, of $688 million.
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures
within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, which are financial measures that are not
calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for
GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to,
financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-
GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to
directors or a financial advisor (like the Hillrom Projections) in connection with a proposed transaction like the merger
when the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP
financial measures to GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Goldman Sachs or BofA Securities for
purposes of their respective opinions or by the Hillrom Board in connection with its consideration of the merger.
Accordingly, Hillrom has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Hillrom
Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
The Hillrom Projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on Hillrom of the merger and
do not attempt to predict or suggest future results following the merger. The Hillrom Projections do not give effect to
the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred
in connection with completing the merger, the effect on Hillrom of any business or strategic decision or action that
has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or
strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but
that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the Hillrom
Projections do not take into account the effect on Hillrom of any possible failure of the merger to occur.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the Hillrom
Projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy
statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the Hillrom Projections set forth above. No one has
made or makes any representation to any investor or shareholder regarding the information included in the Hillrom
Projections. Neither Hillrom nor any of its affiliates assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness,
accuracy or completeness of the Hillrom Projections. Hillrom urges all Hillrom shareholders to review its most recent
SEC filings for a description of its reported financial results. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where
You Can Find More Information.”
In addition, the Hillrom Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date
the Hillrom Projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable
securities laws, Hillrom does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Hillrom Projections or the specific portions
presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events,
even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error.",54,56

On September 30, 2021, Baxter entered into a new $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of banks, which replaces Baxter’s
existing $2.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement dated as of December 20, 2019, which was terminated on
September 30, 2021 contemporaneously with entry into the new U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit agreement.
On October 1, 2021, Baxter Healthcare SA, Baxter World Trade SRL and their existing lender group entered into an
amendment to the existing €200 million revolving credit facility dated as of December 20, 2019, with J.P. Morgan AG,
as administrative agent which, among other things, extends the maturity date of the revolving credit facility
thereunder for an additional five years. BofA Securities has acted and may continue to act as an arranger, bookrunner
and syndication agent for, and as a lender under, the U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and as a lender
under the Euro-denominated revolving credit facility, which relationship with Baxter was disclosed in the relationship
disclosure letter provided by BofA Securities to the Hillrom Board. BofA Securities anticipates that it would receive
less than $150,000 in connection with its commitments to Baxter’s amended U.S. dollar-denominated and Euro-
denominated revolving credit facilities. Goldman Sachs has acted and may continue to act as a lender under both the
U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and the Euro-denominated revolving credit facility, which
relationship with Baxter was disclosed in the relationship disclosure letter provided by Goldman Sachs to the Hillrom
Board. Goldman Sachs anticipates that it would receive customary fees as a lender in connection with its
commitments to Baxter’s amended U.S. dollar-denominated and Euro-denominated revolving credit facilities.

In considering the recommendation of the Hillrom Board to vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement,
Hillrom shareholders should be aware that Hillrom’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that
may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Hillrom shareholders generally. The Hillrom Board was aware
of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in
reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (including the merger), and in recommending to Hillrom shareholders that the merger agreement be
approved. Such interests are described below. The merger will be a “change in control” for purposes of the Hillrom
executive compensation and benefit plans and agreements described below.
Hillrom’s executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are John P.
Groetelaars (President and Chief Executive Officer), Barbara Bodem (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer), Paul S. Johnson (Senior Vice President and President, Patient Support Systems), Andreas G. Frank (Senior
Vice President and President, Front Line Care) and Deborah M. Rasin (Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer
and Secretary). Hillrom’s executive officers who are not named executive officers for purposes of the discussion
below are Amy Dodrill (President, Global Surgical Solutions), Mary Kay Ladone (Senior Vice President, Corporate
Development, Strategy and Investor Relations) and Richard M. Wagner (Corporate Controller).
48TABLE OF CONTENTS
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of Hillrom common stock is $156.00, which is the per share merger
consideration;
•
The effective time as referenced in this section occurs on September 27, 2021, which is the assumed date of
the effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each executive officer of Hillrom was terminated by Baxter without “cause” or due to
the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and
agreements), in either case immediately following the merger and on the assumed date of the effective time
of September 27, 2021.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation
actions that may occur before completion of the merger.
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, outstanding Hillrom
equity-based awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:
•
Each outstanding Hillrom stock option will become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Hillrom common stock underlying such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (y) (i) the
excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price of such stock
option, less applicable taxes. Each Hillrom stock option with a per share exercise price equal to or greater
than the per share merger consideration will be cancelled at the effective time with no consideration.
•
Each outstanding Hillrom restricted stock unit award (a “Hillrom RSU Award”) granted before the date of
the merger agreement and each outstanding Hillrom RSU Award granted on or after the date of the merger
agreement to Hillrom’s non-employee directors will become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Hillrom common stock underlying such Hillrom RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time and (y)
the per share merger consideration, less applicable taxes.
•
Each outstanding Hillrom RSU Award granted on or after the date of the merger agreement excluding any
such Hillrom RSU Award granted to a non-employee director (a “Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Award”) will be
converted automatically into a Baxter restricted stock unit award with respect to the number of shares of
Baxter common stock determined by multiplying: (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock subject
to such Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time by (y) the quotient
obtained by dividing (A) the per share merger consideration by (B) the per share average closing price of
Baxter common stock for the consecutive period of ten (10) trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the last trading date prior to the closing date. Such converted award will otherwise continue on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Hillrom RSU Award, including any provisions
for acceleration of vesting. Such terms and conditions include “double-trigger” protection of the converted
award, meaning that if the employment of the holder (including any executive officer) is terminated by the
surviving corporation without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason,” in
each case, on or within two years (or in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, three years) following a change in
control of Hillrom, all such Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Awards then held by such executive officer would
fully vest upon such termination of employment.
•
Each outstanding Hillrom performance-based restricted stock unit award (a “Hillrom PRSU Award”) will
become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock underlying such Hillrom PRSU
Award immediately prior to the effective time based on a payout percentage of 146% (in the case of such
award granted in Hillrom’s 2020 fiscal year) or 187.5% (in the case of such award granted in Hillrom’s 2021
fiscal year) and (y) the per share merger consideration, less applicable taxes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
See the section entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Hillrom’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement for an estimate of the value of each of
Hillrom’s named executive officer’s unvested Hillrom equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above
under “-Certain Assumptions”, the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable at the effective time to
Hillrom’s three executive officers who are not named executive officers in respect of their unvested Hillrom equity
awards granted prior to the date of the merger agreement is as follows: unvested Hillrom stock options-$1,345,578;
unvested Hillrom RSU Awards-$1,643,683; and unvested Hillrom PRSU Awards-$4,162,946 (based on the estimated
actual payout percentage for awards granted in Hillrom’s fiscal year 2019 and the payout percentage specified in the
merger agreement for awards granted in Hillrom’s fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021). As of the assumed effective
date of September 27, 2021, no Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Awards were held by such executive officers. Hillrom RSU
Awards held by Hillrom’s non-employee directors are fully vested at the time of grant by their terms.
Officer Change in Control Agreements
Hillrom has entered into change in control agreements (each, a “CIC Agreement”) with each of its executive officers.
Under the CIC Agreement, each Hillrom executive officer will be eligible for severance benefits upon a termination of
employment by Hillrom without “cause,” or a resignation by the executive officer for “good reason,” in either case,
on or within two years following a change in control of Hillrom (or in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, three years), or
within three months prior to a change in control if the termination occurs in connection with such change in control,
subject to such executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a separation and release agreement. Pursuant to
such separation and release agreement, each executive officer is required to affirm and acknowledge the continued
application of the restrictive covenants provided in his or her employment agreement (in the case of Mr. Groetelaars,
as modified by the separation and release agreement to reflect a 12-month post-termination restricted period), which
are specifically incorporated by reference into the separation and release agreement, including a non-compete and a
non-solicitation of customers and employees, in each case, that applies during the 12-month period following
termination of employment.
The severance benefits under each CIC Agreement are (i) cash severance equal to two times (or in the case of Mr.
Groetelaars, three times) the sum of the executive officer’s (x) annual base salary in effect immediately before the
change in control or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater and (y) target bonus for the year
of termination (in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, no less than 100% of base salary); (ii) a prorated annual bonus payment
based on actual performance through the end of the year of termination; and (iii) continuation of health and medical
insurance coverage and group term life insurance program for up to two years (or in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, three
years).
In connection with entering into the merger agreement, on September 1, 2021, the Hillrom board of directors amended
the CIC Agreements to provide the executive officers with the right to receive a make-whole payment in the event
that any payments or benefits provided to such executive officers in connection with the merger become subject to
the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The payments would generally place the
executive officers in the same after-tax position that they would have been in if the excise tax did not apply to them,
and do not cover ordinary income taxes due on the payments and benefits giving rise to the excise tax. These make-
whole rights are provided solely in connection with the merger and therefore the amendments will be automatically
revoked if the merger agreement is terminated without the consummation of the merger.
See the section entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Hillrom’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement for the estimated amounts that each of
Hillrom’s named executive officers would receive under their CIC Agreements upon a qualifying termination of
employment following a change in control of Hillrom. Based on the assumptions described above under “-Certain
Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance payments (including a prorated annual cash
incentive award, the actual performance for which is assumed to equal target performance for purposes of this
quantification) and make-whole payments that Hillrom’s three executive officers who are not named executive officers
would receive under their CIC Agreements upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change in
control of Hillrom is $4,595,891 and $3,256,006, respectively.
Treatment of Annual Bonus
Under the terms of the merger agreement and confidential disclosure schedules, Hillrom may provide to each Hillrom
employee who is eligible to participate in a Hillrom annual bonus program, including each executive officer,
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a prorated portion of the annual bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the closing that occurs prior to the
closing, which bonus will be determined based on the greater of (i) the employee’s target annual bonus for such year
and (ii) the employee’s annual bonus amount for such year determined based on (A) actual performance results
through the last completed fiscal quarter prior to the closing and (B) forecast performance results for the remaining
fiscal quarters and assuming an individual performance multiplier of 100%. Such prorated bonus payment would be
provided without duplication of any prorated bonus payment payable under an applicable severance plan or
agreement, including a CIC Agreement.
See the section entitled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Hillrom’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger” beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement for the estimated amount of the prorated
bonus payment that each of Hillrom’s named executive officers would receive under the terms of the merger
agreement. Assuming that the effective time occurs on September 27, 2021, the estimated aggregate amount of the
prorated bonus payments (the actual performance for which is assumed to equal target performance for purposes of
this quantification) that Hillrom’s three executive officers who are not named executive officers would receive under
the terms of the merger agreement is $707,096.
Potential Employment Arrangements with Baxter
Any of Hillrom’s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide
services to Baxter or the surviving corporation may, prior to, on, or following the closing, enter into new
individualized compensation arrangements with Baxter or the surviving corporation and may participate in cash or
equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Baxter or the surviving corporation. As of the date of this proxy
statement, no new individualized compensation arrangements between Hillrom’s executive officers and Baxter or the
surviving corporation have been established.
Indemnification and Insurance
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Hillrom’s non-employee directors and executive officers will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies
following the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled “The
Merger-Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 69 of this proxy statement.
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Hillrom’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger
The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which
requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Hillrom that is
based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits
described below, see the discussion under the caption “Interests of Hillrom’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger” above.
The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the
table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the merger. For purposes
of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of Hillrom common stock is $156.00, which is the per share merger
consideration;
•
The effective time as referenced in this section occurs on September 27, 2021, which is the assumed date of
the effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each named executive officer of Hillrom was terminated by the surviving corporation
without “cause” or due to the officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the
relevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the effective time and on the assumed
date of the effective time of September 27, 2021.

Cash. Consists of (i) a cash severance equal to two times (or in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, three times) the sum of the executive
officer’s (a) annual base salary in effect immediately before the change in control or immediately before the date of termination,
whichever is greater and (b) target bonus for the year of termination (in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, no less than 100% base
salary); and (ii) a prorated annual bonus payment based on actual performance (assumed to equal target performance for purposes
of this quantification) through the end of the year of termination. The cash severance described in clause (i) and prorated bonus
payments described in clause (ii) are “double trigger” and become payable only upon a qualifying termination of employment
following a change in control of Hillrom under the terms of the applicable CIC Agreement (see “Interests of Hillrom’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger-Officer Change in Control Agreements”). The estimated amount of each such payment is
shown in the following table:

In addition, as described above under “Interests of Hillrom’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of
Annual Bonus,” each named executive officer would be eligible to receive, without duplication of the prorated bonus under the
CIC Agreement, a prorated portion of the annual bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the closing that occurs prior to
the closing, which bonus will be determined based on the greater of (x) the officer’s target annual bonus for such year and (y) the
officer’s annual bonus amount for such year determined based on (A) actual performance results through the last completed fiscal
quarter prior to the closing and (B) forecast performance results for the remaining fiscal quarters and assuming an individual
performance multiplier of 100%. Such merger agreement prorated bonus payment will not be paid to the extent that it results in
duplication of the prorated bonus payment due under the CIC Agreement. Assuming an effective time of September 27, 2021 and
achievement of the applicable performance goals at the target level, each such merger agreement prorated bonus payment would
be equal to the CIC Agreement prorated bonus payment shown in the table above.

Equity. Includes accelerated vesting at the effective time of Hillrom RSU Awards, Hillrom PRSU Award and Hillrom stock options
granted before the date of the merger agreement, which is a “single trigger” benefit. The value of Hillrom PRSU Awards is
estimated based on the estimated actual payout percentage for awards granted in Hillrom’s fiscal year 2019 and the payout
percentage specified in the merger agreement for awards granted in Hillrom’s fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021. Any Post-
Signing Hillrom RSU Awards would be entitled to “double trigger” vesting that is triggered only upon a qualifying termination of
employment following a change in control of Hillrom; there were no Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Awards held by the named
executive officers on the assumed effective time of September 27, 2021. For further details regarding the treatment of Hillrom
equity awards in connection with the merger, see “Interests of Hillrom’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-

The consummation of the merger is not subject to any financing conditions. Under the bridge commitment letter, JP
Morgan and Citi have committed to provide the bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $11.4 billion
to bridge debt financing required (i) to fund the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
(ii) to repay, redeem or otherwise terminate any indebtedness of Hillrom outstanding on the closing date (the “debt
repayment”) and (iii) to pay fees and expenses related to the merger, the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and the debt repayment. On September 30, 2021, Baxter entered into the term loan facility, pursuant to
which a syndicate of financial institutions have committed to provide Baxter with a senior unsecured term loan facility
in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. The aggregate principal amount of the commitments under the term
loan facility have replaced a corresponding amount of the commitments in respect of the bridge facility in accordance
with the terms of the bridge commitment letter. As a result, there are now $7.4 billion in bridge facility commitments
remaining. Baxter has informed Hillrom that it expects to replace the remaining commitments under the bridge facility
with cash on hand and/or the issuance of senior unsecured notes.",62,62
"Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc._20211020_DEFM14A_19594022_4314928.Pdf",Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Clearances and Approvals Required for the Merger
HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters. The merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which prevents
Hillrom and Baxter from completing the merger until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ and the FTC and the HSR Act waiting period is terminated or expires. A transaction notifiable
under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the
parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The
parties may also choose to voluntarily re-start the initial 30-calendar-day waiting period by following certain
prescribed procedures. After the expiration of the initial waiting period (or the re-started initial waiting period), the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC may issue a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material
(a “Second Request”). If a Second Request is issued, the parties may not complete the merger until they substantially
comply with the Second Request and observe a second 30-calendar-day waiting period, unless the waiting period is
terminated earlier, or the parties commit not to close for some additional period of time. Hillrom and Baxter submitted
the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act on September 13, 2021. The waiting period under the
HSR Act expired on October 13, 2021. Neither Hillrom nor Baxter received any inquiries from the FTC or DOJ during
the waiting period. On October 13, 2021, the FTC sent a form letter to Hillrom and Baxter indicating that, while the
waiting period has expired, the FTC reserves its right to take further action with respect to the transaction, including
challenging its consummation before or after the fact. This letter is consistent with the HSR Act and the FTC’s
recently announced practice of sending such letters to parties making filings under the HSR Act.
Foreign Regulatory Clearances. The completion of the Merger is subject to approval pursuant to antitrust and
competition laws with the appropriate regulators in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions. The parties
must observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances or consents pursuant to
certain of these foreign antitrust and competition laws, before completing the merger. As of October 13, 2021, the
parties have submitted their initial filings for all required regulatory approvals (including in the European Union).
Other state or foreign antitrust, competition and foreign investment authorities may take action under the laws of
their jurisdictions, which could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger. For more information about
regulatory approvals relating to the merger, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the
Completion of the Merger.”
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these
regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the
merger, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or obligations or enter into
supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

The exchange of Hillrom common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) who receives cash in the merger in exchange for shares of Hillrom common stock will
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.

As of October 20, 2021, four lawsuits have been filed by purported Hillrom shareholders in connection with the
merger. On October 4, 2021, a purported Hillrom shareholder filed a lawsuit against Hillrom and the current members of
the Hillrom board of directors alleging that the Proxy Statement filed by Hillrom in connection with the merger
contained alleged material misstatements and/or omissions in violation of federal law. The lawsuit is captioned O'Dell
v. Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., et al., Case 1:21-cv-08171 and is pending in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. On October 8, 2021, another lawsuit was filed against the same defendants asserting
similar claims. The lawsuit is captioned Ciccotelli v. Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., et al., Case 1:21-cv-08327 and is
pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 12, 2021, two additional
lawsuits were filed against the same defendants asserting similar claims; the first lawsuit is captioned Osborne v. Hill-
Rom Holdings, Inc., et al., Case 1:21-cv-08396 and is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and also named a former member of Hillrom's board of directors as a defendant; the second
lawsuit is captioned Collins v. Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., et al., Case 1:21-cv-05699 and is pending in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
The complaints generally allege that the Proxy Statement filed by Hillrom in connection with the merger fails to
disclose allegedly material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial projections of Hillrom, (ii) certain financial
analyses of Hillrom’s financial advisors, and (iii) certain statements concerning the sales process. Plaintiffs seek,
among other things, to enjoin Hillrom from consummating the merger, or in the alternative, rescission of the merger
and/or compensatory damages, as well as attorney's fees.
Hillrom believes that the allegations in the complaints are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising out of the merger
may also be filed in the future.

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. This summary does not
purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to
you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as the rights and
obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or
any other information contained in this proxy statement.
Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding
the terms of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide any factual information about Hillrom, Baxter or
Merger Sub or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Hillrom or Baxter contained in this proxy
statement or in Hillrom’s or Baxter’s public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the merger agreement and this
summary are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts
and circumstances relating to Hillrom or Baxter. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by
and covenants of Hillrom, Baxter and Merger Sub that were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as
of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with
negotiating the terms of the merger agreement (including by being qualified by confidential disclosure schedules
exchanged between the parties to the merger agreement) and may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality
which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors. In particular, in your review of the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to
bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the
circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to close the merger if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise,
and allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. Information
concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the
date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement.
Additional information about Hillrom may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Hillrom’s other public
filings. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Subject to the provisions of the merger agreement, the closing will take place via the exchange of electronic
documents and executed signature pages and the electronic transfer of funds on the second (2nd) business day
following the date on which the last of the conditions to the closing (described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Conditions to the Completion of the Merger”) has been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by

their nature can only be satisfied by action taken at or immediately prior to the closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of those conditions) or at such other date and time as Hillrom
and Baxter may agree in writing.
Assuming timely receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions, including
obtaining the requisite approval of the merger agreement by the Hillrom shareholders, we currently expect the closing
to occur in early 2022.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, on the closing date, the parties will (i)

in such form as required by the IBCL and (ii) deliver and tender, as applicable, any taxes and fees, and make any and
all other filings or recordings, in each case as required to be made by the parties under the IBCL in connection with
the merger.
The merger will become effective at the date and time as the articles of merger are filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Indiana (or at such later time as Hillrom and Baxter may agree in writing and specify in the articles of
merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the IBCL).

Prior to the effective time, Baxter will appoint a United States bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Hillrom,
to serve as paying agent in connection with the merger. At or prior to the effective time, Baxter will deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the paying agent a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to
provide all funds necessary for the paying agent to pay the aggregate per share merger consideration to holders of
eligible shares of Hillrom common stock and to holders of Hillrom equity-based awards who are not and were not at
any time during the applicable vesting period Hillrom employees, in each case in accordance with the merger
agreement.
As promptly as practicable after the effective time, and in any event within five (5) days of the effective time, Baxter
will cause the paying agent to mail or otherwise provide each shareholder of record of eligible shares that are (A)
represented by stock certificates or (B) book-entry shares not held, directly or indirectly, through DTC notice
advising such shareholders of the effectiveness of the merger, which notice will include appropriate transmittal
materials (including a customary letter of transmittal) specifying that delivery must be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the stock certificates or such book-entry shares must pass, only upon proper delivery of the stock certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the stock certificates, as provided in the merger agreement) or the surrender of such
book-entry shares to the paying agent (which will be deemed to have been effected upon the delivery of a customary
“agent’s message” with respect to such book-entry shares or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of such
surrender
56TABLE OF CONTENTS
as the paying agent may reasonably request), as applicable and instructions describing how such shareholders of
record may surrender such certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the stock certificates, as provided in the merger
agreement) or such book-entry shares to the paying agent in exchange for the portion of the aggregate per share
merger consideration to which such shareholder is entitled to receive as a result of the merger pursuant to the merger
agreement.
With respect to book entry shares held, directly or indirectly, through DTC, Baxter and Hillrom will cooperate to
establish procedures with the paying agent, DTC, DTC’s nominees and such other necessary or desirable third party
intermediaries to ensure that the paying agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as practicable after
the effective time, upon surrender of eligible held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s
customary surrender procedures and such other procedures as agreed by parent, the company, the paying agent,
DTC, DTC’s nominees and such other necessary or desirable third party intermediaries, the “per share merger
consideration” to which the beneficial owners are entitled to receive.
You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock
certificates to the paying agent without a letter of transmittal. Holders of book-entry shares will not be required to
deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive the per share merger
consideration that such holder is entitled to receive as a result of the merger pursuant to the merger agreement.
Upon surrender to the paying agent of eligible shares in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the
holder of such eligible shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore, and Baxter will cause the paying
agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable to each such shareholder an amount in cash in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in the merger agreement) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of such eligible shares surrendered by (ii) the per share merger
consideration. Interest will not be paid or accrued in respect of the per share merger consideration.
From and after the effective time, there will be no further transfers of shares of Hillrom common stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. If, after the effective time, any certificate or acceptable
evidence of a book-entry share formerly representing any eligible share is presented to the surviving corporation,
Baxter or the paying agent for transfer or any other reason, such eligible share will be canceled and exchanged for the
aggregate per share merger consideration to which the holder of such eligible share(s) is entitled to upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of any eligible shares represented by a certificate that has not been registered
in the transfer records of Hillrom, or if a holder of shares would like payment of the applicable per share merger
consideration to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate is registered, a
check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the certificate may be issued to such transferee or other
person if the certificates formerly representing such eligible shares are properly endorsed and are otherwise in proper
form for surrender and are presented to the paying agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each
case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to Baxter and the paying agent. Payment of the applicable
portion of the aggregate per share merger consideration with respect to book-entry shares will only be made to the
person in whose name such book-entry shares are registered in the transfer records of Hillrom.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent remains unclaimed on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
closing date, such cash will be delivered to Baxter or the surviving corporation, as determined by Baxter. Thereafter,
holders of eligible shares who have not exchanged their shares in accordance with the merger agreement will be
entitled to look only to the surviving corporation for payment of the aggregate per share merger consideration to
which such shareholders are entitled pursuant to the merger agreement (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings).
In the event that any certificate representing shares of Hillrom common stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Baxter or the paying agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount and upon such
terms as may be reasonably required by Baxter or the paying agent as an indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Baxter or the surviving corporation with respect to such certificate, the paying agent will pay an amount
in cash in U.S. dollars, after giving effect to any tax withholding, equal to the aggregate per share consideration that
would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the merger agreement.

Each of Baxter, the surviving corporation and the paying agent (and any of their respective affiliates) will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any tax law. To the extent
any such sum is withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts so withheld and remitted will

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, outstanding Hillrom
equity-based awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:
•
Each outstanding Hillrom stock option will become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Hillrom common stock underlying such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (y) (i) the
excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price of such stock
option, less applicable taxes. Each Hillrom stock option with a per share exercise price equal to or greater
than the per share merger consideration will be cancelled at the effective time with no consideration.
•
Each outstanding Hillrom restricted stock unit award (a “Hillrom RSU Award”) granted before the date of
the merger agreement and each outstanding Hillrom RSU Award granted on or after the date of the merger
agreement to Hillrom’s non-employee directors will become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Hillrom common stock underlying such Hillrom RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time and (y)
the per share merger consideration, less applicable taxes.
•
Each outstanding Hillrom RSU Award granted on or after the date of the merger agreement excluding any
such Hillrom RSU Award granted to a non-employee director (a “Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Award”) will be
converted automatically into a Baxter restricted stock unit award with respect to the number of shares of
Baxter common stock determined by multiplying: (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock subject
to such Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time by (y) the quotient
obtained by dividing (A) the per share merger consideration by (B) the per share average closing price of
Baxter common stock for the consecutive period of ten (10) trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the last trading date prior to the closing date, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. Such converted award will otherwise continue on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such Hillrom RSU Award, including any provisions for acceleration of vesting.
•
Each outstanding Hillrom performance-based restricted stock unit award (a “Hillrom PRSU Award”) will
become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock underlying such Hillrom PRSU
Award immediately prior to the effective time based on a payout percentage of 146% (in the case of such
award granted in Hillrom’s 2020 fiscal year) or 187.5% (in the case of such award granted in Hillrom’s 2021

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a “Material Adverse Effect” (as
defined below) standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or
correct has had or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect).
For purposes of the merger agreement, a “Material Adverse Effect” means any event, change, development,
circumstance, fact or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, is materially adverse to the financial condition,
business or operations of Hillrom and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), provided, however, that no event, change,
development, circumstance, fact or effect resulting from any of the following shall constitute or be taken into account
in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would be reasonably expected to occur:

any changes in general United States or global economic or political conditions;
•
changes in the credit, capital, securities or financial markets, commodity prices, inflation or United States or
global regulatory or business conditions;

promulgated by any governmental entity (including any contractor engaged by a governmental entity) or
(ii) any quarantine, “shelter in place,” “stay at home,” workforce reduction, social distancing, shutdown,
closure, vaccination, sequester or any other applicable law, order or recommendations of a governmental
entity, or any applicable directive or guidance from any applicable industry group, or any commercially
reasonable measures adopted by Hillrom or any of its subsidiaries (a) for the protection of the health and
safety of Hillrom’s employees, customers, vendors, service providers or any other persons who physically
interact with representatives of Hillrom or visit any location over which Hillrom exercises any control, (b) to
preserve the assets utilized in connection with the business of Hillrom and its subsidiaries or (c) otherwise

case as in effect from time to time (such measures collectively, the “Covid-19 Measures”);
•
any failure by Hillrom to meet any internal, public or other projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues

with its terms, except pursuant to any of the interim covenant exceptions (provided that Baxter may, in its sole
discretion, withhold, delay or condition its consent to the actions described in the seventh bullet point and the
eighth bullet point below in its sole discretion, in each case to the extent relating to actions by Hillrom only and not

faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or could reasonably

provisions of the confidentiality agreement between Hillrom and Baxter (it being understood that such
agreement need not have comparable standstill provisions), which terms shall not restrict Hillrom from

third party making an Acquisition Proposal, with such written notice containing the names of the third party or third
parties making the Acquisition Proposal or initial communication, as well as the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, communication or proposal. Hillrom has also agreed to thereafter promptly, and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours, keep Baxter reasonably informed of any material change to the terms and conditions of
any such Acquisition Proposal, and to promptly, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of the receipt thereof,
provide to Baxter (or its outside legal counsel) copies of all written materials and other material written
correspondence sent or provided to Hillrom and any of its subsidiaries that describe any terms or conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” means any bona fide proposal or offer made by any
person or group (as defined under Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) (other than a proposal or offer by Baxter or any of
its subsidiaries) (i) providing for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, recapitalization, reorganization,
share exchange, scheme of arrangement, business combination, acquisition (including by means of a primary
issuance, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction) or any other similar transaction (or series of related
transactions) involving Hillrom or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group of related persons
would beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, capital stock or other equity interests representing 25% or
more (on a non-diluted basis) of Hillrom’s common stock or (ii) the acquisition (or series of related acquisitions) by
any person or group of related persons of a business or assets (including any capital stock or securities) that

response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a non de minimis breach of the obligations described in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Non-Solicitation Covenant,” if the Hillrom Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that:
•
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and
•
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law;

which notice is required to include the identity of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal and the

extent requested by Baxter, Hillrom negotiates in good faith with Baxter regarding any adjustments or
modifications to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Baxter; and

at the end of the Takeover Notice Period, the Hillrom Board again makes the determination in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and after taking into account any
revisions to the merger agreement proposed by Baxter in writing and any other information offered by
Baxter during the Takeover Notice Period), that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal and failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the approval of the merger agreement by the Hillrom shareholders, the
Hillrom Board may effect a change of recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if:
•
Hillrom provides Baxter three (3) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice includes all material information with respect to any such Intervening Event and a description
of the Hillrom Board’s rationale for such action;
•
during such three (3) business day period described in the above bullet point, Hillrom negotiates in good
faith with Baxter regarding any adjustments or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement proposed
by Baxter; and
•
at the end of the three (3) business day period described in the first bullet point, the Hillrom Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel (after taking
into account any adjustments or modifications to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Baxter
during the period described in the first bullet point) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
For purposes of the merger agreement, “Intervening Event” means any event, change, development, circumstance,
fact, condition, occurrence or effect that materially affects the business, financial condition, assets, liabilities or
operations of Hillrom and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), and that was not actually known by the Hillrom Board as
of or prior to September 1, 2021 (or if actually known, the material consequences of which were not known by the
Hillrom Board at such time), provided that in no event will the following events, changes, developments,
circumstances, facts, conditions, occurrences or effects constitute or be taken into account in determining whether or
not an Intervening Event has occurred: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) results that
were proximately caused by a material breach of the merger agreement by Hillrom, (iii) Hillrom meeting or exceeding
any internal or analysts’ expectations or projections, in and of itself, or (iv) changes, after September 1, 2021, in the
market price or trading volumes of shares of Hillrom common stock on the NYSE, in and of themselves.

•
an annual base salary or base wage rate that is no less than that provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately before the effective time;

benefits that are at least as favorable as those provided under such plan.
Baxter will or will cause the surviving corporation to (i) cause any preexisting conditions or limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under any Baxter employee benefit plan providing health and welfare benefits to be waived with
respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the
plan year in which such Continuing Employee first becomes eligible to participate in such Baxter employee benefit

to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened proceeding, incurred in connection with, arising out of or
otherwise related to any actual or alleged proceeding, in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to

six (6) years from and after the effective time (the “tail period”) with respect to any claim related to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the effective time from Hillrom’s D&O Insurance carrier as of the date of the merger agreement
or one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as such carrier with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as Hillrom’s existing policies. If Hillrom
for any reason fails to obtain or Baxter for any reason fails to cause to be obtained such “tail” insurance policies as of

immediately prior to the effective time, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any indemnified parties, provided that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period will continue

to obtain the proceeds of the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letters, together with any

after Hillrom’s delivery of written notice to Baxter or Merger Sub describing such breach or failure in
reasonable detail (provided, however, that Hillrom is not then in breach of the merger agreement as would
give rise to a failure of certain conditions to the consummation of the merger to be satisfied); or

Termination Fee Payable by Hillrom
Hillrom will pay to Baxter a termination fee equal to $367,000,000 (the “Hillrom Termination Fee”) if the merger
agreement is terminated:
•
by either Hillrom or Baxter, pursuant to the Outside Date trigger or the failure to obtain the approval of
Hillrom’s shareholders trigger and, in each case:
○
after the date of the merger agreement, an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a “Qualifying
Transaction” (which is an Acquisition Proposal measured at a 50% threshold rather than a 25%
threshold) is made to Hillrom, the Hillrom Board or the Hillrom shareholders or publicly proposed or
publicly announced prior to, and not withdrawn at least five (5) business days prior to, the special
meeting; and
○
within twelve (12) months after any such termination Hillrom consummates any Qualifying Transaction
or enters into any definitive agreement providing for a Qualifying Transaction that is ultimately
consummated, with such payment due no later than two (2) business days after, and subject to, the
consummation of such Qualifying Transaction;
•
by Baxter, prior to Hillrom’s shareholders approving the merger agreement, in the event the merger
agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to the change in recommendation trigger or (ii) as a result of a Willful
Breach by Hillrom of its obligations under the non-solicitation covenant, then promptly (and in no event
later than two (2) business days after the date of such termination), or
•
by Hillrom pursuant to the Superior Proposal trigger, then simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the
effectiveness of any such termination.
In no event will Hillrom be required to pay the Hillrom Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Termination Fee Payable by Baxter
Baxter will pay to Hillrom a termination fee equal to $420,000,000 (the “Baxter Termination Fee”) if the merger
agreement is terminated:
•
by Hillrom or Baxter as a result of the non-appealable order or law trigger, and no Willful Breach by Hillrom
of its obligations described in “The Merger Agreement-Required Efforts to Consummate the Merger” was a
principal cause of the entry or occurrence of such order or law;
•
by Hillrom or Baxter pursuant to the Outside Date trigger, and, at the time of such termination (i) one or
more of the regulatory approvals condition, the no non-appealable order or law condition and the no
Burdensome Condition condition have not been satisfied, (ii) all other conditions to closing have been
satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing) and
(iii) no Willful Breach by Hillrom of its obligations described in “The Merger Agreement-Required Efforts to
Consummate the Merger” was a principal cause of the failure of any of the conditions listed in clause (i) of
this bullet point; or
•
by Hillrom as a result of Baxter breaching its obligations described in “The Merger Agreement-Required
Efforts to Consummate the Merger.”
In the event that the Baxter Termination Fee becomes payable, Baxter must pay such fee to Hillrom within two (2)
business days of any of the terminations described in the three bullet points immediately preceding this sentence. In
no event will Baxter be required to pay the Baxter Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
For purposes of the merger agreement, a “Willful Breach” means an action taken or failure to act that the breaching
party intentionally takes (or intentionally fails to take) and actually knows (or would reasonably have been expected
to have known) would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a material breach of a covenant or agreement set
forth in the merger agreement.",84,84

Hillrom shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give us authority to adjourn or postpone the
special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the merger
agreement if (i) reasonably necessary to obtain a quorum to conduct the business of the special meeting or (ii) there
are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement. If this adjournment
proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by the Hillrom Board to any date, but in no event will
the meeting be adjourned or postponed (a) more than two (2) times or (b) for more than an aggregate of twenty (20)
business days without Baxter’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In addition, the Hillrom Board may postpone the special meeting before it commences, if the Hillrom Board
determines in good faith that it is required by applicable law or the Hillrom Board’s fiduciary duties or for the purpose
of soliciting additional proxies. If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you
sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you sign and return a proxy
and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement but do not indicate
a choice on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. Hillrom does
not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the Merger Proposal (Proposal) 1 has been approved at the special

ARRANGEMENTS (PROPOSAL 3)
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Hillrom is required
to submit a proposal to Hillrom shareholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that
may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Hillrom that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger, as determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. This compensation is summarized in the table
under “The Merger-Interests of Hillrom’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Quantification of Potential
Payments and Benefits to Hillrom’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” including the
footnotes to the table. This proposal is commonly known as “say-on-golden parachutes,” and we refer to it as the
named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.
The Hillrom Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation
information disclosed in this proxy statement.
The Hillrom Board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Hillrom approve the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Hillrom hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation
that may be paid or become payable to Hillrom’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the in the table in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Interests of Hillrom’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Quantification of Potential Payments
and Benefits to Hillrom’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” including the footnotes to the
table and the related narrative disclosures.”
The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the
vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger agreement
and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because
the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding
on either Hillrom or Baxter. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and the merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the
non-binding, advisory vote of Hillrom shareholders.
The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of Hillrom’s named executive officers on an
advisory basis will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Hillrom common stock present in person,
or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy at the
special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
The Hillrom Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal.

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S.
holders (as defined below) of Hillrom common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger.
This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the
Internal Revenue Service, each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing
interpretation, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Hillrom common stock that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
•
a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s
administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a
U.S. person; or
•
an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless
of its source.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of Hillrom common stock who hold such shares as a capital
asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this
discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in
light of such holder’s particular circumstances, or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under
the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, holders who are not U.S. holders, insurance companies,
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign
currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders that hold, directly or
constructively (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five (5)-year period ending on the date
of the merger) 5% or more of the outstanding Hillrom common stock, U.S. holders that have a functional currency
other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, tax-deferred accounts, retirement accounts, governmental
agencies or instrumentalities, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, U.S. expatriates, former long-term
residents of the United States, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in
partnerships, S corporations or such other entities, holders who hold shares of Hillrom common stock as part of a
hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction or other integrated investment, and holders who
acquired their shares of Hillrom common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation
arrangements). This discussion also does not address any tax consequences arising under the alternative minimum
tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (including the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in
connection therewith). In addition, no information is provided with respect to any tax consequences under state,
local, or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax (such as, for
example, U.S. federal estate or gift tax laws).
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) holds shares of Hillrom common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally
depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes that holds Hillrom common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult
their own independent tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger to their specific circumstances.
Holders of Hillrom common stock should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax and any state, local, foreign or other tax laws.
81TABLE OF CONTENTS
Consequences to U.S. Holders
The receipt of the cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Hillrom common stock pursuant to the merger will
be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.
holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Hillrom common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize gain
or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares.
If a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Hillrom common stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one
(1) year as of the date of the merger, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of
certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential
rates currently, which are subject to change. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject
to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Hillrom common stock at different times or different prices,
such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of
Hillrom common stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of Hillrom common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain
circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup
withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury that such U.S. holder is a “United States person”
(within the meaning of the Code), the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not
subject to backup withholding, and must otherwise comply with all applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules. In addition, if the paying agent is not provided with a U.S. holder’s correct taxpayer identification
number or other adequate basis for exemption, the U.S. holder may be subject to certain penalties imposed by the
Internal Revenue Service.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the
required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same
address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those shareholders. This
process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders
and cost savings for companies.
Hillrom and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to
multiple shareholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received
from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be
householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you
revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a
separate proxy statement, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Hillrom if you
are a shareholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request to our Secretary at 130 E. Randolph Street,
Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60601, or calling (312) 819-7200. Shareholders who share a single address, but receive
multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a single copy by notifying Hillrom
at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition, Hillrom will promptly deliver, upon written or
oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a shareholder at a
shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered pursuant to a prior request.

If the merger is completed prior to Hillrom’s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, Hillrom will not hold an annual
meeting of shareholders in 2022 and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of Hillrom’s
shareholders because, following the merger, Hillrom common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Hillrom will no longer be a publicly held company. However, if the merger is
not completed prior to Hillrom’s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, the following deadlines apply to the
submission of shareholder proposals to be considered at Hillrom’s 2022 annual meeting of shareholders.
Under Rule 14a-8, in order for a shareholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy
card relating to the Hillrom 2022 annual meeting, the proposal must have been received at Hillrom’s principal
executive offices no later than September 20, 2021, unless the date of the Hillrom 2022 annual meeting is changed by
more than thirty (30) days from the anniversary of the Hillrom 2021 annual meeting, in which case the proposal must
be received a reasonable time before Hillrom begins to print and mail its proxy materials for the Hillrom 2022 annual
meeting. Hillrom will not be required to include in its proxy statement and proxy card any shareholder proposal that
does not meet all the requirements for such inclusion established by the SEC’s proxy rules and Indiana corporate law.
Pursuant to Hillrom’s bylaws, shareholders may present director nominations or other proposals that are proper
subjects for consideration at an annual meeting. Hillrom’s bylaws require all shareholders who intend to make
nominations or proposals at an annual shareholders meeting to submit their nominations or proposals to Hillrom not
later than one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the previous year’s annual meeting. To
be eligible for consideration at the currently planned Hillrom 2022 annual meeting, such proposals that have not been
submitted by the deadline for inclusion in the proxy statement must be received by Hillrom not later than November
30, 2021. In the event the date of the Hillrom 2022 annual meeting is delayed by more than thirty (30) days from the
date of the anniversary of the Hillrom 2021 annual meeting, shareholder notice must be received by the later of one
hundred (100) days prior to the forthcoming meeting date and the close of business ten (10) days following the date
on which Hillrom first makes public disclosure of the meeting date. These provisions are intended to allow all
shareholders to have an opportunity to consider business expected to be raised at the annual meeting.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Baxter
International Inc. (“Parent”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, no par value (the
“Shares”), of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) of $156.00 in cash per Share, subject to adjustment pursuant

Plan of Merger, dated as of September 1, 2021 (the “Agreement”), by and among Parent, Bel Air Subsidiary, Inc., a

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing,
sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for
various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities
they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time
purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities,
currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective
affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in
connection with the Transaction, all of which are contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the
Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may
arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the
Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and may
receive, compensation, including having acted as book runner with respect to the Company’s 4.375% Senior Notes
due 2027 (aggregate principal amount $425,000,000) in September 2019. We also have provided certain financial
advisory and/or underwriting services to Parent and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment
Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a co-manager with respect
to Parent’s 1.73% Senior Notes due 2031 (aggregate principal amount $650,000,000) in October 2020; and a book
runner with respect to each of Parent’s 3.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (aggregate principal amount $750,000,000) and
3.95% Senior Notes due 2030 (aggregate principal amount $500,000,000) in March 2020. We may also in the future
provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates for
which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to
stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended September 30, 2020;
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other
communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the
Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company standalone prepared by its
management, in each case, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held
discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the strategic
rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the Transaction and the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares;
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar financial and stock market
information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of
certain recent business combinations in the medical technology industry and in other industries; and performed such
other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed
with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibilityfor independent verification thereof. In that regard, we
have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected
benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition
the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor
does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. We were not requested to solicit, and did not solicit,
interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any
other alternative transaction. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of
Shares (other than Parent and its affiliates), as of the date hereof, of the Consideration to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or
aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by
the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the
Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities,
creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such
persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of Shares
(other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to
the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company, Parent or the Transaction,
or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the
Company or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on
economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the
date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on
circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion
expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to
how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been
approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be paid to
the holders of Shares (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of
view to such holders of Shares.

respect to the number (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying: (i) the number of Shares subject to such Post-Signing Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Per Share Merger

that the Surviving Corporation shall have an amount in cash sufficient to pay all amounts required by the
foregoing sentence, including any employer payroll Taxes thereon.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies as of the date of this Agreement of (i) the
fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (including all exhibits and
schedules thereto, the “Debt Commitment Letter”), by and among Parent and the Financing Parties specified
therein and (ii) the executed fee letters, each dated the date of this Agreement, referenced therein, relating to
fees and other terms with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by such Debt Commitment Letter (with
only fee amounts and customary “flex” terms redacted, none of which redacted provisions could affect the
conditionality, enforceability or availability, or reduce the aggregate principal amount, of the Debt Financing)
(collectively, the “Fee Letters” and together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the “Debt Commitment
Letters”). Pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the
Financing Parties have committed to provide Parent with the amounts set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
for the purposes set forth therein (the debt financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, together
with any replacement debt financing, including any bank financing or debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the
“Debt Financing”).
A-38TABLE OF CONTENTS
(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and the
respective commitments thereunder have not been withdrawn, rescinded, reduced or terminated, or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no termination, reduction, withdrawal,
rescission, amendment or modification is contemplated (other than as set forth therein with respect to “flex”
rights and/or to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities who had
not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement), and the Debt Commitment Letters,
in the form so delivered, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of, and are enforceable against,
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other non-affiliated parties thereto, subject, in each case, to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
(c) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other amounts required by the
Debt Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Financing Parties to
provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Financing Parties to reduce the
aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(b), Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the
Closing Date, nor does Parent have Knowledge as of the date of this Agreement that any Financing Party will
not perform its obligations thereunder. Except for customary bond engagement letters and for the redacted Fee
Letters provided to the Company in accordance with clause (a) above, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no contracts, agreements, “side letters” or other arrangements to which Parent is a party relating to the Debt
Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing.
(d) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to constitute, a default or breach by Parent or its
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, of any term of the Debt Commitment
Letters. The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters and giving effect to
any “flex” provision in the Debt Commitment Letters (including with respect to fees and original issue discount),
together with cash of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and the other
sources of funds immediately available to Parent on the Closing Date, will provide Parent with cash proceeds on
the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s obligations under this Agreement and the Debt
Commitment Letters, including the payment of the aggregate amount of Per Share Merger Consideration and any
fees and expenses of or payable by Parent or Merger Sub or Parent’s other Affiliates, and for the repayment or
refinancing of the Company Credit Agreements and the Company Notes (other than the 2024 Debentures) to the
extent required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letters (such amounts, collectively, the “Financing Amounts”).
(e) Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that their obligations under this Agreement to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are not subject to, or
conditioned on, the receipt or availability of any funds or the Debt Financing.
6.7. Brokers and Finders. Except for Perella Weinberg Partners, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Citibank, N.A.,

communication.

Commitment Letters” shall mean the applicable Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented
or modified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this Section 7.16(c) shall not relieve
Parent of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
