The following are answers to some questions that you, as a shareholder of BSGA, may have regarding
the Proposals being considered at the Extraordinary General Meeting. We urge you to read carefully the
remainder of this proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section does not provide all
the information that might be important to you with respect to the Proposals and the other matters being
considered at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Additional important information is also contained in
the annexes to and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.
What is the purpose of this document?
BSGA, BTG, Bitdeer, Blue Safari Mini Corp., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability
under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BSGA, Blue Safari Merge
Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG, Blue Safari
Merge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG,
Bitdeer Merge Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the
Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG and Blue Safari Mini Corp., an exempted
company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of BSGA have agreed to the Business Combination under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A-1, Annex A-2, Annex A-3
and Annex A-4, and is incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. The BSGA Board
is soliciting your proxy to vote for the Business Combination and other Proposals at the Extraordinary
General Meeting because you owned BSGA Ordinary Shares at the close of business on March 20, 2023,
the Record Date for the Extraordinary General Meeting, and are therefore entitled to vote at the
Extraordinary General Meeting. This proxy statement/prospectus summarizes the information that you
need to know in order to cast your vote.
Why is BSGA proposing the Business Combination?
BSGA was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share
purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses.
Based on its due diligence investigations of Bitdeer and the industry in which it operates, including the
financial and other information provided by Bitdeer in the course of BSGA’s due diligence
investigations, the BSGA Board believes that the Business Combination is in the best interests of BSGA
and its shareholders and presents an opportunity to increase shareholder value.
Although the BSGA Board believes that the Business Combination with Bitdeer presents a unique
business combination opportunity and is in the best interests of BSGA and its shareholders, the BSGA
Board did consider certain potentially material negative factors in arriving at that conclusion. See the
section entitled “The Business Combination Proposal - Reasons for BSGA Board’s Approval of the
Business Combination” for a discussion of the factors considered by the BSGA Board in making its
decision.
What is being voted on?
Below are the proposals that the BSGA Shareholders are being asked to vote on:
The Business Combination Proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the Business
Combination;
The Initial Mergers Proposal to approve the Initial Mergers (being presented to BSGA’s shareholders
separately in light of BVI law requirements and for good governance practice);
The Nasdaq Proposal to approve the issuance of securities in connection with the Business
Combination to satisfy requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635;
The Governing Documents Proposal to approve the Amended BTG Articles;
The Governing Documents Proposals A to D to approve certain key differences between the Existing
BSGA Articles and the Amended BTG Articles;
The BTG Incentive Plan Proposal to approve the BTG Incentive Plan; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Proposal (“Letter Agreement”). BSGA anticipates that the Initial Shareholders will vote in favor of each
of the other Proposals.
How many votes do I and others have?
You are entitled to one vote for each BSGA Ordinary Share that you held as of the Record Date. As of
the close of business on the Record Date, there were 3,505,888 outstanding ordinary shares.
What is the consideration being paid to Bitdeer’s security holders?
Upon the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding Bitdeer Ordinary
Share and Bitdeer Preference Share will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive such number
of BTG Class A Ordinary Share equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement),
provided that each issued and outstanding Key Executive Share (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive such number of BTG Class V Ordinary Shares
equal to the Exchange Ratio; (ii) each issued and outstanding Bitdeer RSU will be converted into an
award of restricted share units, representing the rights to receive BTG Class A Ordinary Share under the
BTG Incentive Plan, each subject to substantially the same terms, as adjusted for the Exchange Ratio;
(iii) the outstanding Bitdeer Convertible Note (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be assumed by
BTG and represent the rights to receive BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms and
conditions, as adjusted for the Exchange Ratio; and (iv) each Dissenting Share (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) will represent only the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in the
Merger Agreement.
Did the BSGA Board obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed
with the Business Combination?
Yes. Although the Existing BSGA Articles do not require BSGA to seek a third-party valuation or
fairness opinion in connection with a business combination unless the target is affiliated with an Initial
Shareholder, BSGA retained Royson Valuation Advisory Limited (“Royson”) to provide to the BSGA
Board with opinions regarding the valuation of Bitdeer. See the section entitled “The Business
Combination Proposal - Reports of Valuation Advisor to BSGA,” and the valuation reports of Royson
attached hereto as Annex D for more details.
In addition, BSGA retained IJW & Co., Ltd.(“IJW”), which delivered a written fairness opinion to the
BSGA Board, dated March 7, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, conditions and limitations set forth in the opinion, the consideration to be
paid by BSGA in the Business Combination pursuant to the term of the transaction, was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the shareholders of BSGA. See the section entitled “The Business
Combination Proposal - Fairness Opinion of BSGA’s Financial Advisor,” and the fairness opinion of IJW
attached hereto as Annex E for more details.
Do any of BSGA’s directors or officers have interests that may conflict with my interests with respect to the
Business Combination?
In considering the recommendation of the Board to approve the Merger Agreement, BSGA Shareholders
should be aware that certain BSGA executive officers and directors may be deemed to have interests in
the Business Combination that are different from, or in addition to, those of BSGA Shareholders
generally. These interests, which may create actual or potential conflicts of interest, are, to the extent
material, described in the section entitled “The Business Combination Proposal - Interests of BSGA
Directors and Officers in the Business Combination” beginning on page 138 of this proxy
statement/​prospectus.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
When will BSGA Shareholders receive BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in connection with the Business
Combination?
Upon the effective time of the First SPAC Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding BSGA Ordinary Share
will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive one BTG Class A Ordinary Share, and (ii) each
BSGA Right will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a BTG Class A
Ordinary Share in the same manner as BSGA Ordinary Shares.
Will BSGA Shareholders be able to trade the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that they receive in the transaction?
Yes. BTG has filed an initial listing application to list the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares on The Nasdaq
Stock Market under the symbol “BTDR.” BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in exchange for BSGA
Ordinary Shares in the transaction will be freely transferable under United States federal securities laws
by persons other than affiliates of the BTG.
When and where is the Extraordinary General Meeting?
The Extraordinary General Meeting will take place on April 11, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time, at the office
of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017, and virtually via live
webcast at https://www.cstproxy.com/bluesafarigroup/2023.
In light of ongoing developments related to COVID-19, and the related protocols that governments have
implemented, the BSGA Board determined that the Extraordinary General Meeting will be held both
physically and also virtually via live webcast. The BSGA Board believes that this is the right choice for
BSGA and its shareholders at this time, as it permits shareholders to attend and participate in the
Extraordinary General Meeting while safeguarding the health and safety of BSGA Shareholders,
directors and management team. You will be able to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting online,
vote, view the list of shareholders entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting and submit your

https://www.cstproxy.com/bluesafarigroup/2023. To participate in the virtual meeting, you will need a 12-
digit control number assigned by Continental. The meeting webcast will begin promptly at 9:00 a.m.,
Eastern time. BSGA encourages you to access the Extraordinary General Meeting prior to the start time
and you should allow ample time for the check-in procedures.
Who may vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting?
Only holders of record of BSGA ordinary shares as of the close of business on the Record Date may
vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders. As of the Record Date, there were 3,505,888
ordinary shares outstanding and entitled to vote. See the section entitled “Extraordinary General
Meeting of BSGA Shareholders - Record Date; Who is Entitled to Vote” for further information.
What is the quorum requirement for the Extraordinary General Meeting?
Shareholders representing not less than 50 percent of the ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of
the Record Date and entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting must be present in person
physically or by virtual attendance or represented by proxy in order to hold the Extraordinary General
Meeting and conduct business. This is called a quorum. Ordinary shares will be counted for purposes
of determining if there is a quorum if the shareholder (i) is present and entitled to vote at the meeting, or
(ii) has properly submitted a proxy card or voting instructions through a broker, bank, or custodian. In
the absence of a quorum, shareholders representing a majority of the votes present in person or
represented by proxy at such meeting may adjourn the meeting until a quorum is present.
Am I required to vote against the Business Combination Proposal in order to have my Public Shares redeemed?
No. You are not required to vote against the Business Combination Proposal in order to have the right
to demand that BSGA redeem your Public Shares for cash equal to your pro rata share of the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (before payment of deferred underwriting commissions
and including interest earned on their pro rata portion of the Trust Account, net of taxes payable).
These

TABLE OF CONTENTS
rights to demand redemption of Public Shares for cash are sometimes referred to herein as “Redemption
Rights.” If the Business Combination is not completed, holders of Public Shares electing to exercise
their Redemption Rights will not be entitled to receive such payments and their BSGA Ordinary Shares
will be returned to them.
How do I exercise my Redemption Rights?
If you are a public shareholder and you seek to have your Public Shares redeemed, you must (i) demand,
no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time on April 7, 2023 (at least two business days before the Extraordinary
General Meeting), that BSGA redeem your shares into cash; and (ii) submit your request in writing to
Continental, at the address listed at the end of this section and deliver your shares to Continental
physically or electronically using DTC’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian) System at least two
business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting.
Any corrected or changed written demand of Redemption Rights must be received by Continental, two
business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting. No demand for redemption will be honored
unless the holder’s shares have been delivered (either physically or electronically) to Continental at
least two business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting.
Any demand for redemption, once made, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising
redemption requests (and submitting shares to the transfer agent) and thereafter, with our consent, until
the vote is taken with respect to the Proposals. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our
transfer agent and decide within the required timeframe not to exercise your redemption rights, you may
request that our transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such
request by contacting our transfer agent.
BSGA Shareholders may seek to have their public shares redeemed regardless of whether they vote for
or against the Business Combination and whether or not they are holders of ordinary shares as of the
Record Date. Any public shareholder who holds ordinary shares on or before April 7, 2023 (two
business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting) will have the right to demand that his, her or
its shares be redeemed for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust
account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid, at the consummation of the Business Combination.
The actual per share redemption price will be equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust
Account (before payment of deferred underwriting commissions and including interest earned on their
pro rata portion of the Trust Account, net of taxes payable), divided by the number of ordinary shares
underlying the BSGA Units sold in the IPO. Please see the section entitled “Extraordinary General
Meeting of BSGA Shareholders - Redemption Rights” for the procedures to be followed if you wish to
redeem your ordinary shares for cash.
What is the recommendation of the BSGA Board?
After careful consideration, the BSGA Board unanimously recommends that such BSGA Shareholders,
vote “FOR” the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, “FOR” the approval of the Initial
Mergers Proposal, “FOR” the approval of the Nasdaq Proposal, “FOR” the approval of the Governing
Documents Proposal, “FOR” the approval of each of the Governing Documents Proposals A to D,
“FOR” the approval of the BTG Incentive Plan Proposal, and “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment
Proposal. For details on the required votes to approve each proposal, see the section entitled “What
vote is required to approve the Proposals?”
How can I vote?
If you are a BSGA Shareholder of record, you may vote in person (physically or by virtual appearance)
at the Extraordinary General Meeting or vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card, the Internet or
telephone. Whether or not you plan to participate in the Extraordinary General Meeting, we urge you to
vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. Even if you have already voted by proxy, you may still
attend the virtual Extraordinary General Meeting and vote online, if you choose.
To vote online at the Extraordinary General Meeting, follow the instructions below under “How may I

envelope. If you return your signed proxy card before the Extraordinary General Meeting, we will vote
your shares as you direct.
To vote via the telephone, you can vote by calling the telephone number on your proxy card. Please
have your proxy card handy when you call. Easy-to-follow voice prompts will allow you to vote your
shares and confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded.

If your shares are registered in the name of your broker, bank or other agent, you are the “beneficial
owner” of those shares and those shares are considered as held in “street name.” If you are a beneficial
owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or other agent, you should have received a
proxy card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than directly
from us. Simply complete and mail the proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted. You may be
eligible to vote your shares electronically over the Internet or by telephone. A large number of banks
and brokerage firms offer Internet and telephone voting. If your bank or brokerage firm does not offer

email below to receive a control number and you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or
other nominee reflecting the number of ordinary shares you held as of the Record Date, your name and
email address. You must contact Continental for specific instructions on how to receive the control
number. Please allow up to 72 hours prior to the meeting for processing your control number.
After obtaining a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or other agent, to then register to attend the
Extraordinary General Meeting, you must submit proof of your legal proxy reflecting the number of your
shares along with your name and email address to proxy@continentalstock.com and obtain a valid
control number, then login to https://www.cstproxy.com/bluesafarigroup/2023. Requests for registration
must be received no later than 11.59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the night before the meeting date April 10,
2023.

Who can help answer any other questions I might have about the Extraordinary General Meeting?
If you have any questions concerning the virtual Meeting (including accessing the meeting by virtual
means) or need help voting your ordinary shares, please contact Serena Shie at +852 9583 3199 or email
serena@firsteuro.co.
The Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting, Proxy Statement and form of Proxy Card are available at:
https://www.cstproxy.com/bluesafarigroup/2023.
If my shares are held in “street name” by my bank, brokerage firm or nominee, will they automatically vote my
shares for me?
No. If you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or
other holder of record holding shares for you, your shares will not be voted with respect to any
Proposal for which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. If a proposal is
determined to be discretionary, your broker, bank or other holder of record is permitted to vote on the
proposal without receiving voting instructions from you. If a proposal is determined to be non-
discretionary, your broker, bank or other holder of record is not permitted to vote on the proposal
without receiving voting instructions from you. A “broker non-vote” occurs when a bank, broker or
other holder of record holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a non-discretionary
proposal because the holder of record has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.
An abstention or broker non-vote will be counted towards the quorum requirement but will not count as
a vote cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.
Each of the Proposals to be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting is a non-discretionary
proposal. Accordingly, if you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide voting instructions to your
broker, bank or other holder of record holding shares for you, your shares will not be voted with respect
to any of the Proposals. An abstention or broker non-vote will be counted towards the quorum
requirement but will not count as a vote cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.
What if I abstain from voting or fail to instruct my bank, brokerage firm or nominee?
BSGA will count a properly executed proxy marked “ABSTAIN” with respect to a particular Proposal as
present for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Extraordinary General
Meeting. For purposes of approval, an abstention on any Proposals will not have any effect on the
Proposal.
How can I submit a proxy?
You may submit a proxy by (a) visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/bluesafarigroup/2023 and following
the on-screen instructions (have your proxy card available when you access the webpage), or (b) calling
toll-free +1 800-450-7155 within the U.S. and Canada or +1 857-999-9155 outside of the U.S. and Canada
from any touch-tone phone and follow the instructions (have your proxy card available when you call),
or (c) submitting your proxy card by mail by using the previously provided self-addressed, stamped
envelope.
Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?
Yes. You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the Extraordinary General
Meeting. You may revoke your proxy by executing and returning a proxy card dated later than the
previous one, or by attending the Meeting in person and casting your vote or by voting again by the
telephone or Internet voting options described below, or by submitting a written revocation stating that
you would like to revoke your proxy that our proxy solicitor receives prior to the Extraordinary General
Meeting. If you hold your ordinary shares through a bank, brokerage firm or nominee, you should
follow the instructions of your bank, brokerage firm or nominee regarding the revocation of proxies. If
you are a record holder, you should send any notice of revocation or your completed new proxy card, as
the case may be, to Continental.
Unless revoked, a proxy will be voted at the virtual Meeting in accordance with the shareholder’s
indicated instructions. In the absence of instructions, proxies will be voted FOR each of the Proposals.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?
If you sign and return your proxy card without indicating how to vote on any particular Proposal, the
ordinary shares represented by your proxy will be voted in favor of each Proposal. Proxy cards that are
returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the Extraordinary General Meeting and
cannot be voted.
Should I send in my share certificates now to have my ordinary shares redeemed?
BSGA Shareholders who intend to have their public shares redeemed should send their certificates to
Continental at least two business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting. Please see the section
entitled “Extraordinary General Meeting of BSGA Shareholders - Redemption Rights” for the procedures
to be followed if you wish to redeem your public shares for cash.
Who will solicit the proxies and pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Extraordinary General Meeting?
BSGA will pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Extraordinary General Meeting. BSGA has engaged
Advantage Proxy, Inc. (“Advantage”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Extraordinary
General Meeting. BSGA has agreed to pay Advantage a fee of US$10,000, plus disbursements, and will
reimburse Advantage for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and indemnify Advantage and its
affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages, and expenses. BSGA will also reimburse
banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of
ordinary shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of the ordinary
shares and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors, officers and employees
may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not
be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
What happens if I sell my shares before the Extraordinary General Meeting?
The Record Date for the Extraordinary General Meeting is earlier than the date of the Extraordinary
General Meeting, as well as the date that the Business Combination is expected to be consummated. If
you transfer your ordinary shares after the Record Date, but before the Extraordinary General Meeting,
unless the transferee obtains from you a proxy to vote those shares, you would retain your right to vote
at the Extraordinary General Meeting, but will transfer ownership of the shares and will not hold an
interest in BSGA after the Business Combination is consummated.
When is the Business Combination expected to occur?
Assuming the requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals are received, BSGA expects that the
Business Combination will occur as soon as possible following the Extraordinary General Meeting,
which is expected to occur in April 2023.
Are Bitdeer’s shareholders required to approve the Business Combination?
Yes. Bitdeer is seeking approval by shareholders of the Business Combination through a separate
process and anticipates that such approval will be received prior to the consummation of the Business
Combination.
Are there risks associated with the Business Combination that I should consider in deciding how to vote?
Yes. There are a number of risks related to the Business Combination and other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement that are discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus. Please
read with particular care the detailed description of the risks described in “Risk Factors” beginning on
page 40 of this proxy statement/prospectus.
May I seek statutory appraisal rights or dissenter rights with respect to my shares?
Appraisal rights are available to holders of BSGA Ordinary Shares in connection with the proposed
Business Combination. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Extraordinary General
Meeting of BSGA Shareholders - Appraisal Rights.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens to the funds deposited in the Trust Account at consummation of the Business Combination?
At consummation of the Business Combination, the funds in the Trust Account will be used to pay
holders of the BSGA Public Shares who exercise their redemption rights, to pay transaction expenses
incurred in connection with the Business Combination, including approximately US$18.67 million for
working capital of BTG and its subsidiaries and general corporate purposes of BTG and its subsidiaries.
As of the date hereof, there were cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of
approximately US$18.67 million. These funds will not be released until the earlier of the completion of
BSGA’s initial business combination or the redemption of BSGA Public Shares if BSGA is unable to
complete an initial business combination by June 14, 2023 or the applicable deadline as may be extended
by BSGA up to December 14, 2023 pursuant to Existing BSGA Articles (or a later date approved by
BSGA Shareholders) (the “Combination Deadline”). BSGA estimates that, based on the balance of the
Trust Account as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, approximately US$10.87 per share
redemption price will be paid to the public shareholders exercising their redemption rights.
What happens if a substantial number of BSGA Public Shareholders vote in favor of the Business Combination
Proposal and exercise their Redemption Rights?
BSAG Public Shareholders may vote in favor of the Business Combination and still exercise their
redemption rights; provided, however, that in the event that any closing condition provided in the
Merger Agreement is not satisfied or otherwise waived, then the Business Combination will not be
consummated. If shares are redeemed, the conditions to the Business Combination may not be satisfied
and the Business Combination may not close or the trading market for BTG’s securities following the
Closing and BTG’s financial position may be impacted by the redemption.
What equity stake will current BSGA Shareholders and Bitdeer securities holders hold in BTG immediately
after the consummation of the Business Combination?
It is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination, the ownership of BTG Ordinary
Shares will be as set forth in the table below:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What happens if the Business Combination is not consummated?
If BSGA does not consummate the Business Combination by the Combination Deadline, then pursuant
to Article 24 of the Existing BSGA Articles, BSGA’s officers must take all action necessary (i) to redeem
the public shares within 10 days in cash at a per-share amount equal to the applicable per-share
redemption price and (ii) as promptly as practicable, to cease all operations except for the purpose of
making such distribution and any subsequent winding up of the BSGA’s affairs. Following dissolution,
BSGA will no longer exist as a company. In any liquidation, the funds held in the Trust Account, plus
any interest earned thereon (net of taxes payable), together with any remaining out-of-trust net assets,
will be distributed pro-rata to holders of ordinary shares who acquired such shares in the IPO or in the
aftermarket. The estimated consideration that each ordinary share would be paid at liquidation would be
approximately US$10.87 per share for shareholders based on amounts on deposit in the Trust Account
as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. The closing price of BSGA Ordinary Shares on
Nasdaq as of March 24, 2023 was US$10.73. The Initial Shareholders waived the right to any liquidation
distribution with respect to any ordinary shares held by them.
If I am a holder of BSGA Units, can I exercise Redemption Rights with respect to my BSGA Units?
No. Holders of outstanding BSGA Units must elect to separate the units into the underlying public
shares and public rights prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public shares. If you
hold your units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must notify your broker or bank that you
elect to separate the BSGA Units into the underlying public shares and public rights of BSGA, or if you
hold units registered in your own name, you must contact Continental, BSGA’s transfer agent, directly
and instruct them to do so. The Redemption Rights include the requirement that a holder must identify
itself in writing as a beneficial holder and provide its legal name, phone number and address to the
transfer agent in order to validly redeem its shares. If you fail to cause your units to be separated and
delivered to Continental, prior to 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, on April 7, 2023, you will not be able to exercise
your redemption rights with respect to your Public Shares.
If I am a holder of BSGA Rights, can I exercise Redemption Rights with respect to my rights?
No. Holders of BSGA Rights have no Redemption Rights.
What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising my Redemption Rights?
The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares in redemption of such shares will
be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Please see the section entitled “Material
Tax Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Consequences of a Redemption
of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares” for additional information. You are urged to consult your tax adviser
regarding the tax consequences of exercising your redemption rights.
What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination to me?
As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Material Tax Considerations - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations,” U.S. holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares should expect the exchange
of their shares pursuant to the Business Combination to be a nontaxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. U.S. holders of BSGA Rights should also expect the same treatment, although
there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the transaction is not tax-free to holders of
the BSGA Rights even if it is otherwise tax-free to the holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares. See the
section entitled “Material Tax Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations -
Consequences of the Business Combination.”
The discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus is intended to provide only a general discussion and is not a complete analysis or
description of all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that are applicable to you in respect of
the Business Combination, nor does it address any tax considerations arising under U.S. state or local
or non-U.S. tax laws. You are urged to consult your tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of the
Business Combination to you.

The Parties to the Business Combination
Bitdeer
Bitdeer is a world-leading technology company for the cryptocurrency mining community. As of June
30, 2022, Bitdeer was the world’s second largest holder of proprietary hash rate, which is defined as hash rate
generated from proprietary mining machines; by allocating part of our proprietary hash rate for sale, we were
the world’s largest supplier of hash rate, as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing
market, which is defined as a market where players sell part of their hash rate to customers, according to
Frost & Sullivan.
Bitdeer mines cryptocurrencies for its own account and serves the cryptocurrency mining community
by providing innovative, reliable and easy-to-use cryptocurrency mining solutions. Headquartered in
Singapore, Bitdeer currently operates five proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and Norway

end of 2022 by expanding footprints to six mining datacenters globally. To date, Bitdeer primarily operates
three business lines - “proprietary mining,” “hash rate sharing” and “hosting,” all of which are supported by
Minerplus, Bitdeer’s self-developed integrated intelligent software platform, to enhance operational
efficiency.

be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered
part of, this proxy statement/prospectus. After the consummation of the Business Combination at the
Closing on the Closing Date, Bitdeer will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG.
BSGA
BSGA is a blank check company incorporated as a BVI business company and incorporated for the
purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar
business combination with one or more businesses in the financial technology (FinTech), information
technology (InfoTech), insurance technology (InsurTech) and business services.
BTG
Immediately following the Business Combination, BTG will qualify as a foreign private issuer as defined
in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act. Also, BTG will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the
Nasdaq corporate governance standards and eligible to take advantage of exemptions from certain Nasdaq
corporate governance standards. BTG was incorporated on December 8, 2021, solely for the purpose of
effectuating the Business Combination described herein. BTG was incorporated under the laws of the
Cayman Islands as an exempted company limited by shares. BTG does not own any material assets and does
not operate any business.
As of the consummation of the Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, the number of
directors of BTG will be increased to seven, three of whom shall be independent directors. The mailing

KY1-1106. After the consummation of the Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, BTG will
become the continuing public company.
Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer
Although Bitdeer has not completed the audit of its financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2022, Bitdeer provided certain unaudited financial information (collectively, the “Selected Unaudited
Financial Information of Bitdeer”) to the BSGA Board in connection with its review of the Business
Combination. For more details, see the section entitled “The Business Combination Proposal - BSGA Board’s
Review of Valuation.” The following sets forth the Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and a
discussion of this information:
Bitdeer’s revenue is estimated to be US$330.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to
US$394.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily contributed by a decrease
in revenue generated from its proprietary mining business, driven by (i) the price drop of Bitcoin, the most
significant type of cryptocurrency involved in Bitdeer’s business and (ii) a decrease in the comparative
number of Bitcoin mined from proprietary mining, resulting from a decrease in the amount of hash rate
allocated to Bitdeer’s proprietary mining business as a percentage of the total network hash rate.
Bitdeer’s loss is estimated to be US$62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to
profit of US$82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Such change was primarily due to a decrease
of revenue and an increase in electricity cost associated with increased power supply needs and electricity
prices.
Bitdeer’s adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be US$91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,
compared to US$281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily as a result of
loss for the year. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure used by Bitdeer’s management as a supplemental
measure to review and assess Bitdeer’s operating performance. Bitdeer defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based payment
expenses under IFRS 2. See “- Adjusted EBITDA and Reconciliation” below.
Bitdeer’s net asset value is estimated to be US$316.3 million as of December 31, 2022 , compared to
US$288.1 million as of December 31, 2021.
The Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer reflects trends consistent with Bitdeer’s
performance for the first six months ended June 30, 2022 disclosed in the section entitled “Bitdeer’s
Management’s Disclosure and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Although Bitdeer does not expect its actual results to vary materially from the unaudited preliminary
numbers included in this proxy statement/prospectus, these preliminary numbers are subject to potential
adjustments that may be identified during Bitdeer’s year-end audit. Neither Bitdeer nor BTG will refer back to
the above unaudited preliminary numbers in BTG’s future periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act.
Neither MaloneBailey, LLP nor Marcum LLP or any other independent accountant has audited, reviewed,
examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to afore-mentioned financial numbers
and accordingly, neither MaloneBailey, LLP nor Marcum LLP or any other independent accountant expresses
any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information and assume no responsibility for, and
disclaim any association with, the unaudited preliminary numbers.
Adjusted EBITDA and Reconciliation
In evaluating its business, Bitdeer considers and uses a non-IFRS measure, adjusted EBITDA, as a
supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based
payments expenses under IFRS 2. Such measure is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies. As a result, such measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a
substitute analysis for, Bitdeer’s profit/(loss) for the periods, as determined in accordance with IFRS. For
additional details, including a reconciliation of profit/(loss), the most comparable IFRS measure, to adjusted

The Business Combination Proposal
The Merger Agreement contemplates three mergers in connection with the Business Combination,
consisting of the First SPAC Merger, the Second SPAC Merger and the Acquisition Merger. At the effective
time of the First SPAC Merger, BSGA Merger Sub 1 will be merged with and into BSGA, and the separate
corporate existence of BSGA Merger Sub 1 will cease and BSGA will continue as the surviving company
under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Immediately following the First SPAC Merger and at the effective
time of the Second SPAC Merger, BSGA will be merged with and into BSGA Merger Sub 2 and BSGA Merger
Sub 2 will continue as the surviving company in the Second SPAC Merger under the laws of the British
Virgin Islands as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG. Following the Second SPAC Merger, at the effective
time of the Acquisition Merger, Bitdeer Merger Sub will be merged with and into Bitdeer. Following the
Acquisition Merger, the separate corporate existence of Bitdeer Merger Sub will cease and Bitdeer will
continue as the surviving company in the Acquisition Merger under the laws of the Cayman Islands and
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG.
Reasons for the Structure of the Business Combination
As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination will be consummated via a
multiple-merger structure (also known as “double dummy”), consisting of the Initial Mergers and the
Acquisition Merger. Under such structure, each of BSGA and Bitdeer will merge with a subsidiary of BTG, a
newly formed company, through the Initial Mergers and the Acquisition Merger, respectively. Upon the
consummation of the Business Combination, BTG will be the public company listed on Nasdaq. The multiple-
merger structure was chosen by the parties to the Merger Agreement for business, legal and accounting
reasons. In particular, given BTG’s eligibility as a foreign private issuer, its reporting obligations under U.S.
securities laws will be less burdensome compared to domestic registrants and BTG will be able to prepare
and file its financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards. Such
benefit will not be available immediately upon Closing if the Business Combination were to be conducted
through a reverse triangular merger in which Bitdeer would be acquired directly by BSGA, which would
continue to report as a domestic registrant upon Closing until further assessment of factors such as its
shareholder base and location of assets at a future date pursuant to U.S. securities laws. Operationally,
following the Business Combination conducted via the proposed structure, BTG will be a holding company
that will operate Bitdeer’s current business through its subsidiaries, which is consistent with the
expectations of Bitdeer and BSGA’s management in relation to post-Business Combination corporate and
operational structure.
In addition, the Initial Mergers are structured as two separate mergers primarily for U.S. tax reasons. The
exchange of BSGA Securities (as defined in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) for BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Business Combination is intended to qualify as a tax-free
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations -
Consequences

)
)
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the Business Combination - Qualification of the Initial Mergers as a Reorganization.” The Initial Mergers
that effect the exchange of BSGA Securities for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares are structured as a two-step
merger in the form of the First SPAC Merger and the Second SPAC Merger to reduce the risk that holders will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the exchange of their BSGA Securities for BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares.
Conditions to Closing
The Closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions by the parties
thereto, including, among others, (i) approval of the mergers and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement by the shareholders of BSGA and Bitdeer; (ii) effectiveness of the Registration Statement;
(iii) expiration or termination of the waiting period under antitrust laws; (iv) receipt of approval for listing on
the Nasdaq Capital Market of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares; and (v) BSGA having at least US$5,000,001 of
net tangible assets remaining immediately after the Closing.
In addition, the obligations of each of BSGA and Bitdeer to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement are subject to customary conditions, including, among other aspects, (i) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to customary bring-down
standards); and (ii) the covenants of the other party having been performed in all material respects.
Related Agreements
Voting and Support Agreement
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, BTG,
BSGA and Bitdeer also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement with certain Bitdeer shareholder (the
“Supporting Shareholder”) with respect to the shares of Bitdeer currently owned by the Supporting
Shareholder. The Voting and Support Agreement provides that the Supporting Shareholder will appear at
shareholders meetings of Bitdeer and vote, consent or approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, whether at a shareholder meeting of Bitdeer or by written consent.
It further provides that the Supporting Shareholder will vote against (or act by written consent against) any
alternative proposals or actions that would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Lock-up Agreement
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, concurrently with the closing of the Merger Agreement, certain
holders of at least 95% of the outstanding shares of the Company immediately prior to the closing
(collectively, the “Lock-up Shareholders”) will enter into certain lock-up agreements (the “Lock-up
Agreements”) with BTG, pursuant to which each Lock-up Shareholder agrees to, among other things, lock up
all equity interests of BTG held by such Lock-up Shareholder immediately after the effective time of the
Acquisition Merger for a period of 180 days from such effective time, subject to certain exceptions.
Merger Consideration
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, upon the effective
time of the First SPAC Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding BSGA Ordinary Share will be cancelled and
exchanged for the right to receive one BTG Class A Ordinary Share, and (ii) each BSGA Right will be
cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a BTG Class A Ordinary Share in the
same manner as BSGA Ordinary Share as set forth in subclause (i), with fractional shares to be either
rounded up to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions
of British Virgin Islands law.
At the effective time of the First SPAC Merger, (i) each BSGA Ordinary Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the First SPAC Merger (other than the BSGA Dissenting Shares) will
be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive one BTG Class A Ordinary Share, except
that the BSGA Ordinary Shares that are owned by BSGA as treasury shares or owned by any direct or
indirect subsidiary of BSGA will be canceled and cease to exist without any consideration; (ii) each BSGA

Dissenting Share owned by BSGA shareholders who have validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or
lost their rights to dissent from the First SPAC Merger pursuant to BVI Companies Act will represent only
the right to receive the payment resulting from the procedure set forth in the BVI Companies Act with
respect to the BSGA Dissenting Shares owned by such BSGA Shareholders, and (iii) the one share of BTG
that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First SPAC Merger will be redeemed for an
amount of US$0.0000001 and cancelled.
At the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, (i) each Bitdeer Ordinary Share and each Bitdeer
Preference Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition Merger
(other than any Key Executive Shares and Bitdeer Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and cease to exist in
exchange for the right to receive such number of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that is equal to the Exchange
Ratio; (ii) each Key Executive Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Acquisition Merger will be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive such number of
BTG Class V Ordinary Shares that is equal to the Exchange Ratio; (iii) each Bitdeer RSU outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, whether vested or unvested, will be
assumed by BTG and converted into an award of restricted share units, representing the right to receive, on
the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting, settlement and expiration provisions) as applied
to such Bitdeer RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares, except that the number of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares subject to such restricted share units will
equal the product of the number of Bitdeer Ordinary Shares that were subject to such Bitdeer RSU multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share; (iv) the Bitdeer Convertible Note
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition Merger will be assumed by BTG and
represent the rights to receive, on the same terms and conditions as applied to such Bitdeer Convertible
Note, BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, except that the number of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares to be received
upon conversion of the Bitdeer Convertible Note will equal the product of the number of Bitdeer Ordinary
Shares issuable upon conversion of the Bitdeer Convertible Note multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole share; and (v) each Bitdeer Dissenting Share owned by Bitdeer shareholders who
have validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to dissent from the Acquisition
Merger pursuant to the Cayman Companies Act will represent only the right to receive the payment resulting
from the procedure set forth in the Cayman Companies Act with respect to the Bitdeer Dissenting Shares
owned by such Bitdeer shareholders.
Reasons for BSGA Board’s Approval of the Business Combination
BSGA was formed to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase,
reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more business entities. The BSGA Board sought
to do so by using the networks and industry experience of both the Sponsor, the BSGA Board, and the BSGA
management to identify and acquire one or more businesses.
In evaluating the transaction with Bitdeer, the BSGA Board consulted with its legal counsel and
accounting and other advisors and considered a range of factors. In particular, the BSGA Board considered,
among others, the following factors, although not weighted or in any order of significance:
Bitdeer satisfies a number of acquisition criteria that BSGA had established to evaluate prospective
business combination targets. The BSGA Board determined that Bitdeer satisfies a number of criteria
and guidelines set forth during its initial public offering, including (i) unique competitive advantage in
the markets and/or underexploited growth opportunities that BSGA is uniquely positioned to identify;
(ii) strong management team that can create significant value; and (iii) potential to generate strong
free cash flow.
Favorable prospects for future growth. Information from BSGA and Bitdeer’s management regarding
(i) Bitdeer’s business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, services, management,
competitive position, and strategic business goals and objectives; (ii) general economic, industry,
regulatory, and financial market conditions; and (iii) opportunities and competitive factors within
Bitdeer’s industry.
World’s largest scale of proprietary hash rate. Bitdeer was the world’s largest holder of proprietary
hash rate for Bitcoin as of June 30, 2021, according to Frost & Sullivan. Its proprietary hash rate
provides it with a clear edge in all of its business lines and anchors its unique business model.
26 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Unique business model powers organic hash rate expansion. Bitdeer established a business model
that allows it to constantly reinforce its market-leading position and outpace our competitors in terms
of scaling up our proprietary hash rate.
Ample power supply and low electricity cost secured by global mining datacenters. Bitdeer
strategically opened five mining datacenters in the United States and Norway, where low electricity
cost and crypto-friendly policies support stable operations. With experience in site selection, facility
design, construction and maintenance in over 30 locations around the globe, Bitdeer’s dedicated
global team for mining datacenter construction understands the critical needs of mining as well as the
complex and constantly evolving global landscape of electricity supply. They also have extensive
connections with local electricity experts and power enterprises around the world.
Visionary management team with a proven track record of innovation and execution. Bitdeer is led
by a management team with extensive experience in the cryptocurrency industry, encompassing
research and development, mining and sales of mining machines, and many of them are pioneers in
mining datacenters construction and operation.
Best Available Opportunity. The BSGA Board determined, after a thorough review of other business
combination opportunities reasonably available to BSGA, that the proposed Business Combination
represents the best potential business combination for BSGA based upon the process utilized to
evaluate and assess other potential acquisition targets, and the BSGA Board’s belief that such
processes had not presented a better alternative.
Continued Significant Ownership by Bitdeer. The BSGA Board considered that Bitdeer’s existing
equity holders would be receiving a significant amount of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in the
proposed Business Combination and that Bitdeer’s principal shareholders and key executives are
“rolling over” their existing equity interests of Bitdeer into equity interests in BTG. The current
Bitdeer Shareholders are expected to own approximately 93.6% of the outstanding BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares, constituting approximately 11.0% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares
voting together as a single class, assuming (i) none of BSGA’s public shareholders exercise their
redemption rights in connection with the Business Combination and (ii) no Bitdeer’s shareholder
exercises its dissenters’ rights. If the actual facts are different from these assumptions, the percentage
ownership retained by Bitdeer’s existing shareholders in BTG will be different.
Use of Retained Proceeds. As represented by Bitdeer’s management, the proceeds to be delivered to
BTG in connection with the Business Combination (including funds that remain in BSGA’s trust
account after taking into effect redemptions), are expected to remain on the balance sheet of BTG
after Closing in order to fund Bitdeer’s existing operations and support new and existing growth
initiatives. The BSGA Board considered this factor a sign of commitment by Bitdeer’s management to
Bitdeer’s business following the Business Combination and their confidence in the benefits to be
realized as a result of the Business Combination.
Likelihood of Closing the Business Combination. The BSGA Board believes that an acquisition by
BSGA has a reasonable likelihood of closing without potential issues under applicable antitrust and
competition laws and without potential issues from any regulatory authorities.
For a more complete description of BSGA Board’s reasons for approving the Business Combination,
including other factors and risks considered by the BSGA Board, see the section entitled “The Business
Combination Proposal - Reasons for BSGA Board’s Approval of the Business Combination.”
Opinion of BSGA’s Valuation Advisor
BSGA retained Royson to provide to the BSGA Board with an opinion regarding the valuation of
Bitdeer. BSGA also retained an international accounting firm, (the “Audit Firm”), to further review Royson’s
work product regarding the reasonableness of the methodologies as well as the results thereof. Royson
provided BSGA with their opinion dated November 17, 2021 (the “Original Valuation Report”), an updated
opinion dated December 14, 2021 (the “Updated Valuation Report”) and a further updated opinion dated
March 7, 2023 (the “2023 Valuation Report”), which were reviewed by the Audit Firm. Royson’s updated
opinion as set forth in the 2023 Valuation Report, based upon its investigation, analysis and assumptions
described therein
27 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and the appraisal method employed, is that the fair market value of the 100% non-controlling equity interest
in Bitdeer as of February 17, 2023, being the Final Appraisal Date, is reasonably stated to be one billion, two
hundred and fifty six million (US$1,256,000,000). See the section entitled “The Business Combination
Proposal - Valuation Reports of BSGA’s Valuation Advisor - 2023 Valuation Report of BSGA’s Valuation
Advisor” and the valuation reports of Royson attached hereto as Annex D for more details.
Fairness Opinion of BSGA’s Financial Advisor
IJW delivered a written opinion, dated March 7, 2023, addressed to the BSGA Board to the effect that,
as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, conditions and limitations set
forth in the opinion, the consideration to be paid by BSGA in the Business Combination pursuant to the term
of the transaction, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of BSGA. See the section
entitled “The Business Combination Proposal - Fairness Opinion of BSGA’s Financial Advisor,” and the
fairness opinion of IJW attached hereto as Annex E for more details.
The full text of IJW’s written opinion, dated March 7, 2023, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the
opinion (which are also summarized herein), is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus and
is incorporated herein by reference. IJW’s opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the BSGA Board
(solely in its capacity as such and not in any other capacity) in its evaluation of the Business Combination
(and, in its engagement letter, IJW provided its consent to the inclusion of the text of its opinion as part of
this proxy statement/prospectus). IJW’s opinion is limited solely to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the consideration to be paid by BSGA in the Business Combination and does not address BSGA’s
underlying business decision to effect the Business Combination or the relative merits of the Business
Combination as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to
BSGA. IJW’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any shareholder of BSGA should
vote or act with respect to the Business Combination or any other matter.

period. BTG intends to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to most other public companies, whether or not they are classified as “emerging growth companies,”
including, but not limited to, an exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
requiring that BTG’s independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation.
Foreign Private Issuer
As a “foreign private issuer,” BTG will be subject to different U.S. securities laws than domestic U.S.
issuers. The rules governing the information that BTG must disclose differ from those governing U.S.
companies pursuant to the Exchange Act. BTG will be exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act
prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements to shareholders. Those proxy statements are not
expected to conform to Schedule 14A of the proxy rules promulgated under the Exchange Act.
In addition, as a “foreign private issuer,” BTG’s officers and directors and holders of more than 10% of
the issued and outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, will be exempt from the rules under the Exchange
Act requiring insiders to report purchases and sales of ordinary shares as well as from Section 16 short
swing profit reporting and liability. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to BTG - BTG is a foreign private issuer
within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such, it is exempt from certain provisions
applicable to domestic public companies in the United States.”
Controlled Company
Upon the closing of the Business Combination, Mr. Jihan Wu will control a majority of the voting power
of BTG’s outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, BTG will be a “controlled company” within the meaning
of applicable Nasdaq listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting
power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled
company.” For so long as BTG remains a “controlled company,” it may elect not to comply with certain
corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:
that a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors;
for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation
committees;
30 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that it has a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of
independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities;
and
that it has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a
written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibility.
BTG intends to use these exemptions upon the closing of the Business Combination and it may
continue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future. As a result, you may not have the same
protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate
governance requirements.
Anticipated Accounting Treatment
The Business Combination will be accounted for as a “reverse recapitalization” in accordance with
IFRS. Under this method of accounting, BSGA will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial
reporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business
Combination, the Bitdeer’s shareholders are expected to have a majority of the voting power of BTG, Bitdeer
will comprise all of the ongoing operations of combined company, Bitdeer will comprise a majority of the
governing body of combined company, and Bitdeer’s senior management will comprise all of the senior
management of combined company. Since BSGA does not meet the definition of a business under IFRS, the
transaction is outside the scope of IFRS 3, “Business Combinations”, and it is accounted for as an equity-
settled, share-based payment transaction in accordance with IFRS 2, “Share-based Payments”. Accordingly,
for accounting purposes, the Business Combination will be treated as the equivalent of Bitdeer issuing
shares for the net assets of BSGA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BSGA will be stated
at historical costs. Any difference in the fair value of the consideration deemed to have been issued by
Bitdeer and the fair value of BSGA’s identifiable net assets represents a listing service received by Bitdeer
and is recorded through profit and loss. No goodwill or other intangible assets will be recorded. Operations
prior to the Business Combination will be those of Bitdeer.
Regulatory Matters
The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not subject as
a closing condition to any additional federal, state or foreign regulatory requirement or approval, except for
(i) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-
Scott-Rodio Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and (ii) filings with the registrar of the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the respective plans of merger.
Summary of Risk Factors
In evaluating the proposals to be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of
BSGA, a shareholder should carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus and especially consider the
factors discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.”
The consummation of the Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, and the business
and financial condition of BTG subsequent to the Closing are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
including those highlighted in the section title “Risk Factors.” The occurrence of one or more of the events
or circumstances described below, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may
adversely affect BSGA’s ability to effect the Business Combination, and may have an adverse effect on the
business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations of BSGA prior to the Business
Combination and that of BTG subsequent to the Business Combination. These risks include, among other
things, the following:
The cryptocurrency industry in which Bitdeer operates is characterized by constant changes. If
Bitdeer fails to continuously innovate and to provide solutions or services that meet the expectations
of its customers, it may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers.
Bitdeer’s results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be significantly impacted
by sharp Bitcoin price fluctuation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The supply of Bitcoins available for mining is limited and Bitdeer may not be able to quickly adapt to
new businesses when all the Bitcoins have been mined.
Although Bitdeer has an organic way of growing its mining fleets, its business is nevertheless capital
intensive. Bitdeer may need additional capital but may not be able to obtain it in a timely manner and
on favorable terms or at all.
Bitdeer has experienced negative cash flows from operating activities and incurred net losses in the
past. It can provide no assurance of its future operating results.
Bitdeer may not be able to maintain its competitive position as cryptocurrency networks experience
increases in total network hash rate.
Bitdeer has experienced and may experience in the future hash rate loss during its operations due to
factors beyond its control.
Bitdeer is subject to risks associated with its need for significant electric power and the limited
availability of power resources, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. In the event
of any failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial
reporting, BTG may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud. As a result,
holders of BTG Ordinary Shares could lose confidence in BTG’s financial and other public reporting,
which is likely to negatively affect BTG’s business and the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares.
A market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may not develop, which would adversely affect the
liquidity and price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
The market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be volatile.
BTG will issue BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, and BTG Class V Ordinary Shares convertible into BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares, as consideration for the Business Combination, and BTG may issue
additional BTG Class A Ordinary Shares or other equity or convertible debt securities without
approval of the holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, which would dilute existing ownership
interests and may depress the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
BSGA will be forced to liquidate the Trust Account if it cannot consummate a business combination
by the Combination Deadline. In the event of a liquidation, BSGA’s public shareholders will receive
US$10.87 per share and the BSGA Rights will expire worthless.
The Initial Shareholders who own ordinary shares and private placement units will not participate in
liquidation distributions and, therefore, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether
the Business Combination is appropriate.
BSGA Shareholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of BTG
Ordinary Shares as consideration in the Business Combination and from other dilution sources.
Having a minority share position may reduce the influence that the non-redeeming BSGA
shareholders have on the management of BTG upon Closing.
If third parties bring claims against BSGA, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-
share liquidation price received by BSGA Shareholders may be less than US$10.87.
BSGA’s directors and officers may have certain conflicts in determining to recommend the acquisition
of Bitdeer, since certain of their interests, and certain interests of their affiliates and associates, are
different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder.
Becoming a public company through a business combination rather than an underwritten offering
presents risks to unaffiliated investors of BTG. Subsequent to the completion of the Business
Combination, BTG may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and
impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition,
results of operations and the price of BTG securities, which could cause BTG shareholders to lose
some or all of their investment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If BSGA were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act,
BSGA would be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and its activities would be
severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless BSGA is able to modify its activities so
that it would not be deemed an investment company, BSGA would expect to abandon the efforts to
complete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate itself.
BTG will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed on Nasdaq. However, BTG
may be unable to maintain the listing of its securities in the future.
Any distributions received by BSGA Shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was
proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, BSGA was unable to
pay its debts as they fell due in the ordinary course of business.
If BSGA’s due diligence investigation of Bitdeer was inadequate, then shareholders of BSGA
following the Business Combination could lose some or all of their investment.
In the event that a significant number of Public Shares are redeemed, BSGA Ordinary Shares may
become less liquid following the Business Combination.

The following summary unaudited pro forma combined financial data (the “summary pro forma data”)
gives effect to the Business Combination.
The summary pro forma data have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the
unaudited pro forma combined financial information of BTG appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/​
prospectus and the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is based
upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical financial statements of BSGA and combined and
consolidated financial statements of Bitdeer and related notes included in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The summary pro forma data have been presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily
indicative of what BTG’s financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the
Business Combination been completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the summary pro forma data do
not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of BTG.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus
has been prepared using the assumptions below with respect to the potential redemption into cash of
BSGA’s Class A Ordinary Shares:
Scenario 1 - Assuming No Redemptions: This presentation assumes that no Public Shareholders
exercise Redemption Rights with respect to their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares for a pro rata share of
the funds in BSGA’s Trust Account.
Scenario 2 - Assuming Maximum Redemptions: This presentation assumes that BSGA’s Public
Shareholders exercise their Redemption Rights with respect to a maximum of 1,718,388 BSGA Class A
Ordinary Shares upon consummation of the Business Combination at a redemption price of
approximately US$10.84 per share. Scenario 2 includes all adjustments contained in Scenario 1 and
presents additional adjustments to reflect the effect of the maximum redemptions.
The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to the expected events that are
related and/or directly attributable to the transactions and are factually supportable. The adjustments
presented in the selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been
identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of BTG
upon consummation of the transactions.
The historical financial statements of Bitdeer have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and in its
presentation currency of the U.S. dollar. The historical financial statements of BSGA have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of the U.S. dollar. The condensed combined pro
forma financial information reflects IFRS, the basis of accounting used by BTG, and no material accounting
policy difference is identified in converting BSGA’s historical financial statements to IFRS except the
adjustment to reclassify BSGA’s ordinary shares subject to redemption to other liabilities under IFRS. The
adjustments presented in the selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have
been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of
BTG after giving effect to the Business Combination. Bitdeer and BSGA did not have any historical
relationship prior to the Business Combinations. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were required to
eliminate activities between the companies.
This information should be read together with Bitdeer’s and BSGA’s financial statements and related
notes, “Bitdeer’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” “BSGA’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and other financial information included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative
purposes only. Such information is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the section titled
“Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.” The financial results may have been different had

Risks Related to Bitdeer
Risks Related to Bitdeer’s Business, Operations, Industry and Financial Condition
The cryptocurrency industry in which Bitdeer operates is characterized by constant changes. If Bitdeer fails to
continuously innovate and to provide solutions or services that meet the expectations of its customers, Bitdeer may
not be able to attract new customers or retain existing customers, and hence its business and results of operations
may be adversely affected.
The cryptocurrency industry in which Bitdeer operates is characterized by constant changes, including
rapid technological evolution, continual shifts in customer demands, frequent introductions of new products
and solutions and constant emergence of new industry standards and practices. Thus, Bitdeer’s success will
depend, in part, on its ability to respond to these changes in a cost-effective and timely manner. Advances in
Bitcoin mining-related technology have led to increased demand for higher speed and power efficiency for
solving computational problems of increasing complexity. Bitdeer needs to invest significant resources in
research and development in order to keep its services competitive in the market. Also, if Bitdeer is unable to
generate enough revenue or raise sufficient capital to make adequate research and development investments
going forward, Bitdeer’s service improvement and relevant research and development initiatives may be
restricted or delayed, or Bitdeer may not be able to keep pace with the latest market trends and satisfy its
customers’ needs, which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations.
Furthermore, research and development activities are inherently uncertain, and Bitdeer might encounter
practical difficulties in commercializing its research and development results, which could result in excessive
research and development expenses or delays. Given the fast pace with which blockchain technologies have
been and will continue to be developed, Bitdeer may not be able to timely upgrade its technologies in an
efficient and cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, new developments relating to computing power
(e.g., quantum computer), computing energy consumption, blockchain and cryptocurrency could render
Bitdeer’s services obsolete or unattractive. If Bitdeer is unable to keep up with the technological
developments and anticipate market trends, or if new technologies render its technologies or solutions
obsolete, customers may no longer be attracted to its services. As a result, Bitdeer’s business, results of
operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
Bitdeer’s results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be significantly impacted by Bitcoin price
fluctuation.
Bitdeer’s ability to generate economic benefits (i.e., positive cash flow or profits) from Bitcoin mining is
directly affected by the market price of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price may impact the use of Bitdeer’s mining
machines. When the market price of a Bitcoin drops below certain thresholds, the operation of existing
mining machines may not be economically beneficial for Bitdeer. For a breakeven analysis, see the section
entitled
44 TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Bitdeer’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations - Price and volatility of Bitcoin.” In addition, the depreciation
and impairment potential of Bitdeer’s mining machines may be affected by the volatility of the market prices
of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. See the section entitled “Bitdeer’s Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Factors Affecting Our Results of
Operations - Our ability to procure mining machines at a lower cost.” On the other hand, a drop in Bitcoin
price may also create an opportunity for Bitdeer to add cheaper mining machines to its mining fleets.
The appreciation potential of Bitcoin is high in general, which is due to several factors. Bitcoins are
inherently scarce, given they are designed to have a finite supply of 21 million associated with a depreciating
rewarding mechanism, termed “halving,” under which the reward for Bitcoin mining is reduced in half every
four years. See the section entitled “- The “halving” of rewards available on the Bitcoin network, or the
reduction of rewards on other networks, has had and in the future could have a negative impact on Bitdeer’s
ability to generate revenue as its customers may not have an adequate incentive to continue transaction
processing and customers may cease transaction processing operations altogether, which could have a
material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations” for more details.
The growing recognition of Bitcoin also attracts large investment into the Bitcoin economy, as evidenced by
an increasing installed network hash rate of Bitcoin globally, and increasing adoption of Bitcoin as an
investment instrument and a payment method. Further, more countries are establishing clear and robust
regulations to create a stable environment for Bitcoin mining and trading, which may facilitate the demand
for Bitcoins and Bitcoin price appreciation.
Despite the general appreciation potential of Bitcoin, there are a number of other factors that contribute
to changes in Bitcoin price and volatility, including, but not limited to, Bitcoin market sentiment,
macroeconomic factors, utility of Bitcoin, and idiosyncratic events such as exchange outages or social
media, some of which are beyond Bitdeer’s control. For example, decentralization, or the lack of control by a
central authority, is a key reason that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have attracted many committed users.
However, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is subject to growing discussion and suspicion. Some claim that
most of the actual services and businesses built within the Bitcoin ecosystem are in fact centralized since
they are run by specific people, in specific locations, with specific computer systems, and that they are
susceptible to specific regulations. Individuals, companies or groups, as well as Bitcoin exchanges that own
vast amounts of Bitcoins, can affect the market price of Bitcoin. For example, Bitcoin price has recently been
adversely affected by the continued industry-wide fallout from the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of
cryptocurrency exchanges FTX Trading Ltd., et al. (“FTX”) (including its affiliated hedge fund Alameda
Research LLC), crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (“Three Arrows”), crypto miners Compute North
LLC (“Compute North”) and Core Scientific Inc. (“Core Scientific”) and crypto lenders Celsius Network LLC,
et al. (“Celsius Network”), Voyager Digital Ltd., et al. (“Voyager Digital”) and BlockFi Inc., et al. (“BlockFi”).
Furthermore, mining equipment production and mining pool locations are becoming centralized. Some argue
that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is a fundamental flaw rather than a strength. The suspicion
about the decentralized nature of Bitcoin may cause the market to lose confidence in the prospect of the
Bitcoin industry, which would adversely affect Bitcoin price. This in turn could adversely affect the market
demand for Bitdeer’s services and business.
Any future significant reductions in the price of Bitcoin will likely have a material and adverse effect on
Bitdeer’s results of operations and financial condition. There is no assurance that the Bitcoin price will
remain high enough to sustain the demand for Bitdeer’s hash rate sharing and hosting services or that the
Bitcoin price will not decline significantly in the future. Furthermore, fluctuations in the Bitcoin price can
have an immediate impact on the trading price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares after the consummation of the
Business Combination, even before its effect, if any, is reflected in Bitdeer’s financial performance. If the
Bitcoin price drops, the expected economic return of Bitcoin mining activities will diminish, thereby resulting
in a decrease in demand for Bitcoin-related services of Bitdeer, and in value appreciation from Bitdeer’s
proprietary mining activities. As a result, Bitdeer may need to reduce the price of its cloud hash rate and
hosting services. For risks relating to the impact of Bitcoin price fluctuation on Bitdeer’s growth trends, see
the section entitled “- Bitdeer may be unable to execute its growth strategies or effectively maintain its rapid
growth trends” below.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The supply of Bitcoins available for mining is limited and Bitdeer may not be able to quickly adapt to new
businesses when all the Bitcoins have been mined.
Bitcoins are inherently scarce, given they are designed to have a finite supply of 21 million associated
with “halving” mechanism. More than 19 million Bitcoins had already been mined as of June 30, 2022,
according to Frost & Sullivan. The number of blocks that can be solved in a year is designed to be fixed, and
the number of Bitcoins awarded for solving a block in the blockchain halves approximately every four years
until the estimated complete depletion of Bitcoin available for mining by around 2140. When the Bitcoin
network was first launched, the reward for validating a new block was 50 Bitcoins. In November 2012, the
reward for validating a new block was reduced to 25 Bitcoins. In July 2016, the reward for validating a new
block was reduced to 12.5 Bitcoins, and in May 2020, the reward was further reduced to 6.25 Bitcoins. The
next halving for Bitcoin is expected in 2024 at block 840,000, when the reward will reduce to 3.125 Bitcoins.
While the remaining Bitcoins are not designed to be entirely depleted in the near future, a decrease in the
reward for solving a block or an increase in the transaction fees may result in a decrease in incentives for
miners to continue their mining activities and the loss of Bitcoin’s dominant position among the
cryptocurrencies, thereby reducing the demand for Bitcoin mining related services of Bitdeer. As of the date
of this proxy statement/prospectus, the largest portion of Bitdeer’s revenue was generated from its
proprietary mining business and hash rate sales through Cloud Hash Rate, which are associated with
Bitcoin mining. Bitdeer may not be able to quickly adapt to new businesses or expand to other
cryptocurrencies when all the Bitcoins have been discovered or Bitcoin is replaced by other
cryptocurrencies as the mainstream cryptocurrency, which will result in a significant negative impact on
Bitdeer’s business and results of operations.
Although Bitdeer has an organic way of growing its mining fleets, its business is nevertheless capital intensive. It
may need additional capital but may not be able to obtain it in a timely manner and on favorable terms or at all.
The costs of constructing, developing, operating and maintaining cryptocurrency mining and hosting
facilities, and owning and operating a large fleet of the latest generation mining equipment are substantial.
Bitdeer’s operations may require additional capital or financing from time to time in order to achieve further
growth. Bitdeer may require additional cash resources due to the future growth and development of its
business. Bitdeer’s future capital requirements may be substantial as Bitdeer seeks to expand its operations,
diversify its product offering, and pursue acquisitions and equity investments. If Bitdeer’s cash resources
are insufficient to satisfy its cash requirements, Bitdeer may seek to issue additional equity or debt securities
or obtain new or expanded credit facilities or enter into additional factoring arrangements.
Bitdeer’s ability to obtain external financing in the future may be subject to a variety of uncertainties,
including its future financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the liquidity of international
capital and lending markets. While Bitdeer faces less working capital constraints as it expands its hash rate
sharing business, which generates quicker cash payback, the proprietary mining business is nevertheless
capital intensive. Bitdeer may need additional capital if Bitcoin price increases as it will likely push up prices
for supplies required for its proprietary mining business. However, in light of conditions impacting the
industry, it may be more difficult for Bitdeer to obtain equity or debt financing currently and/or in the future.
Specifically, the crypto assets industry has been negatively impacted by recent events such as the
bankruptcies of Compute North, Core Scientific, Alameda Research LLC, BlockFi, Celsius Network, Voyager
Digital, Three Arrows and FTX. In response to these events, the digital asset markets, including the market
for Bitcoin specifically, have experienced extreme price volatility and several other entities in the digital asset
industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the
digital assets markets and in Bitcoin. Any indebtedness that Bitdeer may incur in the future may also contain
operating and financial covenants that could further restrict its operations. There can be no assurance that
financing will be available in a timely manner or in amounts or on terms acceptable to Bitdeer, or at all. A
large amount of bank borrowings and other debt may result in a significant increase in interest expense while
at the same time exposing Bitdeer to increased interest rate risks. Equity financings could result in dilution to
Bitdeer’s shareholders, and the securities issued in future financings may have rights, preferences and
privileges that are senior to those of Bitdeer’s ordinary shares. Any failure to raise needed funds on terms
favorable to Bitdeer, or at all, could severely restrict its liquidity as well as have a material adverse effect on
its business, financial condition and results of operations.
46 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Bitdeer may not be able to maintain its competitive position as cryptocurrency networks experience increases in the
total network hash rate.
As the relative market price of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, increases, more companies are
encouraged to mine for that cryptocurrency and as more mining machines are added to the network, its total
hash rate increases. In order for Bitdeer to maintain its competitive position under such circumstances,
Bitdeer must increase its total hash rate by acquiring and deploying more mining machines, including new
mining machines with higher hash rates. There are currently only a few companies capable of producing a
sufficient number of machines with adequate quality to address the increased demand. If Bitdeer is not able
to acquire and deploy additional mining machines on a timely basis, its proportion of the overall network
hash rate will decrease and Bitdeer will have a lower chance of solving new blocks which will have an
adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business and results of operations.
Bitdeer has experienced negative cash flows from operating activities and incurred net losses in the past. It can
provide no assurance of its future operating results.
Bitdeer had negative cash flows from operating activities in the amount of US$56.6 million, US$109.2
million, US$52.5 million, US$0.7 million and US$151.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and
2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Bitdeer incurred a net loss of US$27.9
million and US$55.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, generated a net
profit of US$113.8 million and US$82.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended
December 31, 2021, and incurred a net loss of 25.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Bitdeer has
generated negative cash flow from operating activities and incurred loss in the past, and there is no
assurance that Bitdeer will be able to generate positive cash flow from operating activities or achieve or
subsequently maintain profitability in the future. Bitdeer will need to generate and sustain increased revenue
and net income levels in future periods in order to increase profitability, and, even if Bitdeer does, Bitdeer
may not be able to maintain or increase its level of profitability over the long term. Bitdeer’s ability to
achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operating activities will depend on a mix of factors, some of
which are beyond its control, including the price of Bitcoin, Bitdeer’s ability to operate and expand its
business and manage its services mix, and Bitdeer’s ability to secure favorable commercial terms from
suppliers.
Bitdeer’s limited operating history and rapid revenue growth may make it difficult for Bitdeer to forecast its
business and assess the seasonality and volatility in its business.
Bitdeer has achieved rapid growth since its inception. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and
2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, Bitdeer’s total revenue amounted to US$88.8 million,
US$186.4 million, US$394.7 million, US$219.7 million and US$179.6 million, respectively. However, there is no
assurance that Bitdeer will be able to maintain its historical growth rates in future periods. Bitdeer’s growth
rates may decline for any number of possible reasons, including decreasing market price of cryptocurrencies,
increasing competition, declining growth of the cryptocurrency industry, unforeseeable technology
innovation, emergence of alternative mainstream cryptocurrencies, or changes in government policies,
regulations or general economic conditions. It is also difficult to forecast seasonality and volatility in
Bitdeer’s business, and as a result accurately allocating resources including hash rate, mining farm capacity,
or human capital to different business lines to achieve the best results in the medium or long term. If
Bitdeer’s growth rates decline, investors’ perceptions of Bitdeer’s business and business prospects may be
adversely affected and the market price of its ordinary shares could decline. In addition, given the volatile
nature of cryptocurrencies and that Bitdeer’s business and financial condition correlate with the market price
of cryptocurrencies, it is difficult to evaluate Bitdeer’s business and future prospects based on its limited
operating history or historical performance.
Bitdeer has experienced and may experience in the future hash rate loss during its operations due to factors beyond
its control.
Bitdeer generates hash rate through operating its proprietary mining datacenters. To efficiently increase
managing hash rate (i.e., proprietary hash rate and hosting hash rate), Bitdeer’s efforts include constructing
and expanding mining datacenters in prime locations globally, purchasing the latest mining machine models
and continually optimizing operational efficiency of its mining farms and mining machines. However, hash
47 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
rate generation is affected by factors beyond Bitdeer’s control, including temperature, humidity, mining
machine quality, the depreciation and deterioration of mining machines, the location of Bitdeer’s mining
machines globally, spare parts supply quality, quantity and timeliness, sudden surge in power price or
sudden power outage, maintenance team members’ lack of experience, unseen computer virus attack, etc. For
example, Bitdeer has experienced hash rate loss during 2021, primarily due to relocation of mining machines
as well as unfavorable weather condition. In the future, Bitdeer expects the risks of hash rate loss will remain,
which may affect its business and results of operations.
The estimated numbers included in this proxy statement/prospectus are internally developed by our management. If
these estimates prove to be incorrect or inaccurate, our actual operating results may differ materially and adversely
from those forecasted or projected.
We included certain estimated numbers in this proxy statement/prospectus, including key selected
financial information of Bitdeer based on the unaudited management accounts of Bitdeer for the year ended
December 31, 2022 and other internally prepared financials and certain key financial information of Bitdeer.
The estimated numbers were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or the published
guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding the preparation and
presentation of the estimated numbers. BSGA did not prescribe or relay any instructions, guidelines,
parameters, inputs, assumptions or other directions to Bitdeer’s management with respect to the estimated
numbers included in this proxy statement/prospectus. These estimated numbers should not be viewed as
public guidance.
The estimated numbers included in this proxy statement/prospectus have been prepared by, and are the
responsibility of, Bitdeer’s management. Neither MaloneBailey, LLP nor Marcum LLP or any other
independent accountant has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with
respect to the estimated numbers contained herein and accordingly, neither MaloneBailey, LLP nor Marcum
LLP or any other independent accountant expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the
estimated numbers. The Marcum LLP report included in this proxy statement/prospectus relates to BSGA’s
historical financial statements. The MaloneBailey, LLP report included in this proxy statement/prospectus
relates to Bitdeer’s historical financial statements. Although Bitdeer does not expect its actual results to vary
materially from the unaudited preliminary results included herein, these preliminary numbers are subject to
potential adjustments that may be identified during Bitdeer’s year-end audit. If Bitdeer’s actual financial
conditions are not consistent with the preliminary results, whether or not resulting from any potential
adjustments that are identified during Bitdeer’s year-end audit, it could have an adverse impact on the market
valuation of Bitdeer or the financial position of the post-Business Combination entity.
Bitdeer is subject to risks associated with its need for significant electric power and the limited availability of power
resources, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Bitdeer’s business requires a significant amount of electric power. The costs of electric power account
for a significant portion of Bitdeer’s cost of revenue. Bitdeer requires a significant electric power supply to
conduct its mining activity, to produce cloud hash rate and to provide hosting services such as powering
and cooling Bitdeer’s and its customers’ servers and network equipment and operating critical mining and
hosting infrastructure.
There has been a substantial increase in the demand for electricity for cryptocurrency mining, and this
has had varying impacts on local electricity supply. Additionally, Bitdeer currently relies on renewable
sources of power and plans to increase its reliance on renewable sources of power in the future. Renewable
power is generally an intermittent and variable source of electricity, which may not always be available.
Because the electrical grid has very little storage capacity, the balance between electricity supply and
demand must be maintained at all times to avoid a blackout or other cascading problem. Intermittent sources
of renewable power are challenging because they disrupt the conventional methods for planning the daily
operation of the electrical grid. Their power fluctuates over multiple time horizons, forcing the grid operator
to adjust its day-ahead, hour-ahead, and real-time operating procedures.
48 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The amount of power required by Bitdeer and its customers will increase commensurately with the
demand for Bitdeer’s services and the increase in mining machines Bitdeer operates for itself and its hosting
customers. Should Bitdeer’s operations require more electricity than can be supplied in the areas where its
mining facilities are located or should the electrical transmission grid and distribution systems be unable to
provide the continuous, steady supply of electricity required, Bitdeer may have to limit or suspend activities
or reduce the speed of its proposed expansion, either voluntarily or as a result of either quotas imposed by
energy companies or governments, or increased prices for certain users (such as Bitdeer). If Bitdeer is unable
to procure electricity at a suitable price, Bitdeer may have to shut down its operations in that particular
jurisdiction either temporarily or permanently. Therefore, increased power costs and limited availability and
curtailment of power resources will reduce Bitdeer’s revenue and have a material and adverse effect on its
cost of revenue and results of operations. Although Bitdeer aims to build and operate energy efficient
facilities, there can be no assurance such facilities will be able to deliver sufficient power to meet the
growing needs of Bitdeer’s business. If Bitdeer is unable to receive adequate power supply and is forced to
reduce its operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, its business would experience
materially negative impacts.
Certain government actors have begun to intervene with the supply of electrical energy to
cryptocurrency miners. For example, recently on March 9, 2023, the Department of the Treasury published
General Explanations of the Administration’s Fiscal Year 2024 Revenue Proposals, in which it proposed
imposing a 30% excise tax on electricity usage by digital asset miners. Governments or government
regulators may potentially restrict electricity suppliers from providing electricity to mining datacenter in
times of electricity shortage increase the cost, including through taxation, of, electricity, or may otherwise
potentially restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to businesses like Bitdeer. In the event government
regulators issue moratoriums or impose bans or restrictions involving hosting operations or transaction
processing in jurisdictions in which it operates, Bitdeer will not be able to continue its operations in such
jurisdictions. A moratorium ban or restriction could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, Bitdeer’s cryptocurrency mining machines would be materially adversely affected by a
power outage. Energy costs and availability are vulnerable to risks of outages and power grid damage as a
result of inclement weather, animal incursion, sabotage and other events out of Bitdeer’s control. Because
the mining portion of Bitdeer’s business consumes a large amount of energy, it is not practical or economical
for Bitdeer’s operations to run on back-up generators in the event of a power outage, which may be caused
by weather, acts of God, wild fires, pandemics, falling trees, falling distribution poles and transmission
towers, transmission and distribution cable cuts, other force majeure events in the electricity and natural gas
markets and/or the negligence or malfeasance of others. Any system downtime resulting from insufficient
power resources or power outages could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
If Bitdeer fails to accurately estimate the factors upon which Bitdeer bases its contract pricing, Bitdeer may
generate less profit than expected or incur losses on those contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on
Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer’s cloud hash rate and hosting contracts are generally priced taking into account various factors
including the then Bitcoin price, network hash rate, purchase cost of mining machines, estimated power
consumption by Bitdeer’s clients, along with other costs of products or services, as adjusted for actual
costs. Bitdeer’s ability to earn a profit on such contracts requires that Bitdeer accurately estimate the costs
involved and outcomes likely to be achieved and assess the probability of generating sufficient hosting and
colocation capacity within the contracted time period. Bitdeer’s pricing of hash rates may cause significantly
lower income than Bitdeer could have generated through using the same hash rates for proprietary mining.
Bitdeer may also not be able to accurately forecast the outcome of selling its products and services at a
particular price and the inability to accurately estimate the factors upon which Bitdeer bases its contract
pricing could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Bitdeer has broad discretion regarding pricing strategy and resource allocation and may exercise related business
judgments in a way that you may not agree with. Such judgments may not achieve the best possible outcome for its
business operations.
Bitdeer’s business operations involve constant and important decision-making regarding the pricing of
its services and allocation of mining resources. Bitdeer takes into account its estimates of market trends
when
49 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
determining pricing strategies. To achieve profitability in the long run, Bitdeer may offer lower price in order
to acquire and retain new customers, even if this pricing does not allow Bitdeer to maximize its short-term
revenue. As Bitdeer operates three business lines, Bitdeer has to decide the allocation of proprietary hash
rate between “proprietary mining” and “hash rate sharing” as well as the allocation of mining datacenter
capacity among “proprietary mining,” “hash rate sharing” and “hosting.” While allocating more mining
resources to “hash rate sharing” and “hosting” services may facilitate cash payback and mining datacenter
expansion while lower risk exposure associated with Bitcoin price volatility, Bitdeer has to forgo its huge
appreciation potential to some extent as Bitdeer could earn more Bitcoins by allocating the same mining
resources to “proprietary mining,” and vice versa. Bitdeer spends great efforts in making these business
decisions in the Company’s best interest, taking into account Bitcoin price, network hash rate, the amount of
cash Bitdeer needs and its view on the market opportunities for acquiring mining machines or expanding
mining datacenters at low cost, etc. However, Bitdeer cannot guarantee that its decisions could generate the
most revenue or offer the strongest downside protection for the Company. If Bitdeer cannot accurately
estimate any of the aforementioned factors upon which Bitdeer bases, its contract pricing could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operation.
Bitdeer faces intense competition and its competitors may employ aggressive pricing strategies, which can lead to a
price reduction of Bitdeer’s solutions and services and material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s results of operations.
Bitdeer operates in highly competitive industries for cryptocurrency mining and related services, and
Bitdeer may look to enter into markets with very competitive landscapes. Bitdeer’s competitors include many
well-known worldwide players, and Bitdeer faces competitors that are larger than itself and have advantages
over itself in terms of economies of scale and financial and other resources. Bitdeer expects that competition
in Bitdeer’s markets will continue to be intense. Some of Bitdeer’s competitors may also have stronger brand
names, greater access to capital, longer histories, longer relationships with their suppliers or customers and
more resources than Bitdeer does. Furthermore, these competitors may be able to adapt to changes in the
industry more promptly and efficiently. Intense competition from existing and potential competitors could
result in material price reductions in the products Bitdeer sells or a decrease in its market share. Aggressive
pricing strategies by Bitdeer’s competitors and an abundant supply of hash rate sharing or hosting services
in the market may cause Bitdeer to reduce the prices of its services and also negatively affect the demand for
Bitdeer’s services or harm Bitdeer’s profitability. If Bitdeer fails to compete effectively and efficiently or fails
to adapt to changes in the competitive landscape, Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected.
The average selling prices of Bitdeer’s solutions and services may fluctuate from time to time due to technological
advancement and Bitdeer may not be able to pass onto its machine suppliers such decreases, which may in turn
adversely affect its profitability.
The Bitcoin-related industry is characterized by rapid launches of new products, continuous
technological advancements and changing market trends and customer preferences, all of which may
translate to fluctuations in the average selling prices of products or services over time. Because Bitdeer
competes in an environment of rapidly evolving technology advancement, market trends and developments
of the hash rate sharing and hosting industry, there is no assurance that Bitdeer will be able to pass on any
decrease in average selling prices of Bitdeer’s services to its suppliers in a timely manner or at all. In the
event that average selling prices of Bitdeer’s services unusually or significantly decrease and such
decreases cannot be offset by a corresponding decrease in the prices of the principal components of its
services, Bitdeer’s gross profit margins may be materially and adversely affected.
There are uncertainties over the outcome of Bitdeer’s mining operations.
Bitdeer’s mining operation comprises blockchain mining technologies that depend on a network of
computers to run certain software programs to solve complex transactions in competition with other mining
operations and to process transactions. Because of this less centralized model and the complexity of
Bitdeer’s mining operation, there are uncertainties over the likelihood of winning a block reward and hence
the outcome of Bitdeer’s mining operations. While Bitdeer participates in mining pools to combine its mining
operations with other mining participants to increase processing power to solve blocks, there can be no
assurance that such pools will adequately address this risk.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is in its early stage and any adverse development in
the cryptocurrency or blockchain market could adversely affect Bitdeer’s business and results of operations.
Blockchain is a voluntary open network that can be used by anyone with devices connected to the
internet. It allows every node to create immutable data, transparent record of transactions and peer-to-peer
transactions in an efficient, secure and trust-free manner. Because of such advantages, blockchain can be
applied to various industries and activities, such as cryptocurrency, payment, financial services, Internet-of-
Things (IoT), cloud computing and cybersecurity, among others. However, there can be no assurance of
such acceptance in the society. There may not be strong market demand for Bitdeer’s mining services as a
key and important process during the application process of blockchain technology, and Bitdeer’s
prospects, business and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected.
Adverse developments in the blockchain industry could lead to a decrease in the demand for hash rate
products and hosting resources, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations. Bitdeer faces risks including those related to:
a decline in the adoption and use of Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies within the technology
industry or a decline in value of cryptocurrencies;
increased costs of complying with existing or new government regulations applicable to
cryptocurrencies and other factors;
a downturn in the market for blockchain hosting space generally, which could be caused by an
oversupply of or reduced demand for blockchain space;
any transition by Bitdeer’s customers of blockchain hosting from third-party providers like Bitdeer to
customer-owned and operated facilities;
the rapid development of new technologies or the adoption of new industry standards that render
Bitdeer or its customers’ current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and, in the case of
Bitdeer’s customers, that contribute to a downturn in their businesses, increasing the likelihood of a
default under their service agreements or their becoming insolvent;
a slowdown in the growth of the internet generally as a medium for commerce and communication;
availability of an adequate supply of new generation cryptocurrency mining equipment to enable
Bitdeer to mine cryptocurrencies at scale and for customers who want to purchase hash rate from
Bitdeer or host with Bitdeer to be able to do so; and
the degree of difficulty in mining cryptocurrencies and the trading price of such assets.
Additionally, Bitcoin, a mainstream cryptocurrency based upon blockchain technology, was first
introduced in 2008 and is generally regarded as the first application of the blockchain technology. The
Bitcoin network and its surrounding ecosystem is still in a relatively early development stage.
Cryptocurrencies have only recently become selectively accepted as a means of payment for goods and
services by many industries, and use of cryptocurrency by consumers to pay in such industries remains
limited. In addition, there may be some jurisdictions that restrict the use of Bitcoins and other
cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange and the conversion between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.
There is no assurance that usage of cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoins, will continue to grow. As
Bitdeer’s business focuses on proprietary cryptocurrency mining and serving cryptocurrency miners, and
relies heavily on the cryptocurrency market, any lack of usage of or fade in the public interest for
cryptocurrency may adversely affect Bitdeer’s business, future prospects, results of operations and financial
condition.
Bitdeer is subject to risks associated with legal, political or other conditions or developments regarding holding,
using or mining of cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoins, which could negatively affect its business, results of
operations and financial position.
Bitdeer’s customers are based globally. As such, changes in government policies, taxes, general
economic and fiscal conditions, as well as political, diplomatic or social events, expose Bitdeer to financial
and business risks. In particular, changes in policies and laws regarding holding, using and/or mining of
Bitcoins could result in an adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business operations and results of operations.
Moreover, if any
51 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
international jurisdiction where it operates mining datacenters or sell its Bitcoin mining related services
prohibits or restricts Bitcoin mining activities, Bitdeer may face legal and other liabilities and will experience a
material loss of revenue.
There are significant uncertainties regarding future regulations pertaining to the holding, using or
mining of Bitcoins, which may adversely affect Bitdeer’s results of operations. While Bitcoin has gradually
gained more market acceptance and attention, it is anonymous and may be used for black market
transactions, money laundering, illegal activities or tax evasion. As a result, governments may seek to
regulate, restrict, control or ban the mining, use and holding of Bitcoins. Bitdeer’s existing policies and
procedures for the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorism-funding activities through
its business activities have only been adopted in recent years and may not completely eliminate instances in
which Bitdeer or its services may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering and other illegal or
improper activities. Bitdeer is subject to anti-money laundering laws in many jurisdictions in which it
operates. Bitdeer cannot assure you that there will not be a failure in detecting money laundering or other
illegal or improper activities which may adversely affect its reputation, business, financial condition and
results of operations.
With advances in technology, cryptocurrencies are likely to undergo significant changes in the future. It
remains uncertain whether Bitcoin will be able to cope with, or benefit from, those changes. In addition, as
Bitcoin mining employs sophisticated and high computing power devices that need to consume a lot of
electricity to operate, future developments in the regulation of energy consumption, including possible
restrictions on energy usage in the jurisdictions where Bitdeer sells its products or services, may also affect
Bitdeer’s business operations and the demand for Bitdeer’s current and future mining related products or
services, including cloud hash rate, hosting and Minerplus. There have been public backlashes surrounding
the environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining, particularly the large consumption of electricity, and
governments of various jurisdictions have responded. For example, in the United States, certain local
governments of the State of Washington have discussed measures to address environmental impacts of
Bitcoin-related operations, such as the high electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining activities.
Substantial increases in the supply of mining machines connected to the Bitcoin network would lead to an increase
in network hash rate capacity, which in turn would increase mining difficulty. This development would negatively
affect the economic returns of Bitcoin mining activities, which would decrease the demand for and/or pricing of
Bitdeer’s products and services.
The difficulty of Bitcoin mining, or the amount of computational resource required for a set amount of
reward for recording a new block, directly affects the expected economic returns for Bitcoin miners, which in
turn affects Bitdeer’s proprietary mining business and the demand for Bitdeer’s Bitcoin mining related
products and services including hash rate sharing and hosting. Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how
much computing power is required to record a new block and it is affected by the total amount of computing
power in the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin algorithm is designed to the effect that one block is generated, on
average, every ten minutes, no matter how much computing power is in the network. Thus, as more
computing power joins the network, and assuming the rate of block creation does not change (remaining at
one block generated every ten minutes), the amount of computing power required to generate each block and
hence the mining difficulty increases. In other words, based on the current design of the Bitcoin network,
Bitcoin mining difficulty would increase together with the total computing power available in the Bitcoin
network, which is in turn affected by the number of Bitcoin mining machines in operation. From January 2019
to December 2021, Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by approximately 3.3 times, according to Frost &
Sullivan. As a result, a strong growth in promotion of Bitcoin computing power supply services can
contribute to further growth in the total computing power in the network, thereby driving up the difficulty of
Bitcoin mining and resulting in downward pressure on the expected economic return of Bitcoin mining and
the demand for, and pricing of, Bitdeer’s products and services.
Bitdeer’s business is highly dependent on acquiring a sufficient number of cryptocurrency mining equipment from
its suppliers. Bitdeer may not be able to obtain new mining hardware or purchase such hardware at competitive
prices during times of high demand, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer’s business is highly dependent upon cryptocurrency mining equipment suppliers providing an
adequate supply of new generation cryptocurrency mining machines at economical prices to support its
52 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
proprietary mining, hash rate sharing and hosting business lines and its customers’ mining activities. The
growth in Bitdeer’s business is directly related to increased demand for hosting services and
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin which is dependent in large part on the availability of new generation
mining machines offered for sale at a price conducive to profitable cryptocurrency mining, as well as the
trading price of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The market price and availability of new mining machines
fluctuates with the price of Bitcoin and can be volatile.
Historically, an increase in interest and demand for cryptocurrencies has led to a shortage of mining
hardware and increased prices. In addition, as more companies seek to enter the mining industry, the demand
for machines may outpace supply and create mining machine equipment shortages. There is no assurance
that cryptocurrency mining equipment suppliers will be able to keep pace with any surge in demand for
mining equipment. Bitdeer and its customers and the potential customers of Bitdeer’s hosting service may in
the future experience difficulty in obtaining new equipment or replacement components for Bitdeer’s and
the future experience difficulty in obtaining new equipment or replacement components for Bitdeer’s and
their existing equipment, including graphics processing units and application-specific integrated circuit
chipsets and computer servers, which in the future may have, a material impact on the demand for Bitdeer’s
products and services and associated revenue. Further, Bitdeer may have little or no recourse in the event a
mining machine manufacturer or distributor defaults on its mining machine delivery commitments. If Bitdeer
and its customers are not able to obtain a sufficient number of cryptocurrency mining machines at favorable
prices, Bitdeer’s growth expectations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be
negatively impacted.
Bitdeer relies on supplies from a single or a group of third-party electricity, mining pool services and mining
machines providers, and any negative incidents caused by actions taken by them that are outside of Bitdeer’s control
may adversely impact Bitdeer’s business and results of operations.
To some extent, Bitdeer currently relies on a single or a group of third-party suppliers and service
providers to provide quality services to customers. Bitdeer’s brand and reputation may be harmed by actions
taken by such third parties that are outside of Bitdeer’s control. For example, Bitdeer is currently contracting
with one electricity supplier to support each of its mining farms in Norway, as well as Texas, Tennessee and
Washington in the United States, respectively. Pursuant to Bitdeer’s agreement with its electricity supplier
for the mining datacenter in Hustadvika municipality, Norway, Bitdeer agrees to purchase power at the
amount and price designated in the contract, during the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024,
which is the term of this agreement. Pursuant to Bitdeer’s agreement with its electricity supplier for the
mining datacenter in Tydal municipality, Norway, Bitdeer agrees to purchase power at the amount and price
designated in the contract, during the period from September 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024, which is the term
of this agreement. Both agreements can be completely terminated with zero load ending at midnight of the
final day in each quarter. Pursuant to Bitdeer’s agreement with its electricity supplier in Texas, the supplier
shall provide electricity to meet full electricity requirements of the two electricity service accounts identified
by Bitdeer. This contract is effective through December 31, 2026 and is terminable in the event of default.
Pursuant to Bitdeer’s agreement with its electricity supplier in Tennessee, the supplier shall make power
available to Bitdeer in the amount designated in the contract. Valid through July 31, 2026, this contract is
automatically renewed for additional five years upon expiration of the initial term, unless either party notifies
the other in writing not less than 60 days prior to the expiration date of the initial term or any renewal term of
its desire to terminate this contract on such expiration date. Pursuant to Bitdeer’s agreement with its
electricity supplier in Washington, the supplier shall provide power and associated energy to meet Bitdeer’s
demand at rates that are subject to adjustment, modification, change or replacement from time to time. This
contract remains effective until terminated upon six months prior written notice by Bitdeer. While Bitdeer
believes that alternative suppliers are readily available in the market, changing to a new supplier may require
additional costs and time. Bitdeer also sources mining machines from a wide variety of manufacturers and
traders with whom it has built relationships over the years. The prices of mining machines were negotiated
on an individual basis, and the agreements typically allow for termination upon either party’s uncured
material breach, suspension of all or a substantial part of its business, deterioration of its financial position,
or upon insolvency proceedings against either party. In addition, these agreements may include
indemnification provisions either for benefit of Bitdeer, or for benefit of the manufacturers and traders. Each
agreement requires manufacturers and traders to repair or replace the defective part/component of mining
machines at no charge to Bitdeer. Despite the measures Bitdeer has taken to ensure the quality of products
and services provided by third-party suppliers and service providers, to the extent they are unable to
maintain their production facilities’ efficiency,
53 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
supply sufficient products in a timely manner, or provide satisfactory products and services to Bitdeer’s
customers, which may be due to events that are beyond Bitdeer’s or their control, such as manufacturing
defects, Bitdeer may suffer reputational damage, and Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected. While Bitdeer has not experienced such incidents that
had a material adverse impact on its business as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, as such
incidents are beyond Bitdeer’s control, there is no assurance that such incidents will not occur in the future
regardless of the measures Bitdeer has taken, and will take, to maintain the quality products and services
provided by third-party suppliers and service providers. If Bitdeer is unable to effectively address these
risks, its brand image, reputation and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.
Additionally, Bitdeer utilizes third-party mining pools to receive its mining rewards from a given
network. Mining pools allow mining participants to combine their processing power, which increases the
chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool
operators, proportionally to Bitdeer’s contribution to the pools’ overall mining power used to solve a block.
Bitdeer entered into agreements with mining pool operators who deliver cryptocurrency rewards to accounts
of Bitdeer or Bitdeer’s customers in exchange for hash rate provided by Bitdeer and Bitdeer’s Cloud Hash
Rate customers. The agreements are terminable through mutual agreement between both parties or due to a
breach of the contract which is not cured within two days upon receiving notice from the non-breaching
party. Due to the competitiveness of the global mining pool industry, Bitdeer believes that it will be able to
promptly access alternative mining pools if needed. Nevertheless, Bitdeer is dependent on the accuracy of a
mining pool operator’s record keeping to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool
for a given Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency mining application in order to assess the proportion of that total
processing power Bitdeer provided. While Bitdeer has internal methods of tracking both Bitdeer’s power
provided and the total power used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own record-keeping to
determine Bitdeer’s proportion of a given reward. Bitdeer has little means of recourse against the mining pool
operator if Bitdeer determines the proportion of the reward paid out to Bitdeer by a mining pool operator is
incorrect, other than leaving the pools or entering into a lengthy negotiation with the third-party mining
pools to get back the fair rewards. If Bitdeer is unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards
from its mining pool operators, Bitdeer may experience reduced reward for its efforts, which would have an
adverse effect on its business and operations.
Failure to keep Bitdeer’s solutions and services up-to-date in line with the approximate level of market demand
could cause Bitdeer to lose sales, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
In order to operate its business successfully and meet the demands and expectations of its customers,
Bitdeer must maintain a certain level of equipment, including but not limited to mining machines, to sustain
large scale service when required. Furthermore, Bitdeer is required to maintain an appropriate level of
equipment for any unexpected emergency substitute or in preparation of potential outage and sudden
service loss. However, forecasts are inherently uncertain. If Bitdeer’s forecasted demand is lower than actual
demand or Bitdeer’s risk estimate is much sufficient, Bitdeer may not be able to provide its customers with
sufficient hash rate sharing or hosting services in a timely manner, and Bitdeer may lose sales and market
share to its competitors.
Bitdeer may be unable to execute its growth strategies or effectively maintain its rapid growth trends.
Bitdeer has experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded its business in recent years. Bitdeer’s
total net revenue increased by 110.0% from US$88.8 million in 2019 to US$186.4 million in 2020, and further
increased by 111.7% to US$394.7 million in 2021. For the first six months in 2022, Bitdeer generated US$179.6
million in total net revenue, as compared to US$219.7 million generated for the first six months in 2021.
Bitdeer incurred a net loss of US$27.9 million and US$55.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, respectively, generated a net profit of US$113.8 million and US$82.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2021, and incurred a net loss of US$25.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022. Bitdeer may not be able to grow its revenue and achieve profitability in the
future if Bitdeer is not able to successfully execute its product development and diversification, geographic
expansion and other growth plans. In addition, Bitdeer’s rapid growth has placed and will continue to place
significant demands on its management and its administrative, operational, research and development and
financial resources.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
To accomplish Bitdeer’s growth strategies and manage the future growth of its operations, Bitdeer will
be required to enhance its research and development capabilities, improve its operational and financial
systems, and expand, train and manage its growing employee base. Furthermore, Bitdeer needs to maintain
and expand its relationships with Bitdeer’s customers, suppliers, research institutions, third-party
manufacturers and other third parties. Moreover, as Bitdeer introduces new products or services or enter
new markets, Bitdeer may face new market, technological, operational and regulatory risks and challenges
with which it is unfamiliar.
Bitdeer’s current and planned operations, personnel, systems, internal procedures and controls may not
be adequate to support Bitdeer’s future growth and expansion. In addition, the success of Bitdeer’s growth
strategies depends on a number of external factors, such as the development of the cryptocurrency market
and the demand for Bitcoin, the level of competition Bitdeer faces and evolving customer behavior and
preferences. If Bitdeer is unable to execute its growth strategies or manage its growth effectively, Bitdeer
may not be able to capture market opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which may materially
and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business prospects and results of operations.
Moreover, Bitdeer’s ability to generate profits and/or positive cash flow is correlated to the current and
future market prices of cryptocurrencies and a decline in the market prices for cryptocurrencies could
negatively impact Bitdeer’s future operations. For example, the recent decreases in Bitcoin price resulted
from the FTX bankruptcy is expected to negatively impact Bitdeer’s mining yields. However, Bitdeer believes
that, as compared to many other participants in the crypto assets markets, Bitdeer is more resilient to
cryptocurrency price volatility as its “hash rate sharing” and “hosting” businesses allow Bitdeer to smooth
the impact of cryptocurrency price volatility. For more details regarding the two business lines, see the
sections entitled “Information Related to Bitdeer - Our Strengths - Unique business model powers organic
hash rate expansion by generating instant and continuous cash” and “Information Related to Bitdeer - Our
Business Lines and Software Infrastructure.” In addition, Bitdeer expects its “proprietary mining” business
line to continue to recoup cash, unless the Bitcoin price experiences a drastic drop. For a breakeven analysis
in this regard, see the section entitled “Bitdeer’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations - Price and volatility
of Bitcoin.” For risks relating to the impact of Bitcoin price fluctuation of Bitdeer’s operations, see the
section entitled “- Bitdeer’s results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be significantly
impacted by Bitcoin price fluctuation” above.
In addition, Bitdeer also faces risks associated with the expansion of its operations overseas. See the
section entitled “- Bitdeer faces risks associated with the expansion of its scale of operations globally, and if
Bitdeer is unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair Bitdeer’s ability to expand its business
abroad.” If Bitdeer is not able to manage its growth or execute its strategies effectively, Bitdeer’s expansion
may not be successful and its business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.
Bitdeer faces risks associated with the expansion of its scale of operations globally, and if Bitdeer is unable to
effectively manage these risks, they could impair Bitdeer’s ability to expand its business abroad.
Bitdeer operates its business globally, with customers and suppliers located in various countries. As
Bitdeer continues to grow its business and expand its operations globally, it will continue to sell its products
and services into new jurisdictions in which Bitdeer has limited or no experience and in which Bitdeer’s
brands may be less recognized. Bitdeer’s global operation exposes it to a number of risks, including:
a limited customer base and limited sales and relationships with international customers;
difficulty in managing multinational operations;
competitors in overseas markets who have stronger ties with local customers and greater resources;
fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
challenges in providing customer products and services and support in these markets;
challenges in managing Bitdeer’s overseas sales force and implementing sales strategies effectively;
unexpected transportation delays or interruptions or increases in international transportation costs;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
difficulties in and costs of exporting products overseas while complying with the different
commercial, legal and regulatory requirements of the overseas markets in which Bitdeer offers its
products and services;
regulations, changes to regulation, regulatory uncertainty in or inconsistent regulations across
various jurisdictions that may implicate cryptocurrency mining and other cryptocurrency activities;
difficulty in ensuring the compliance with the sanctions imposed by The Office of Financial Assets
Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (“OFAC”), the European Union or the United Nations
Security Council on various foreign states, organizations and individuals;
inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights in all the jurisdictions Bitdeer
operates in;
inability to effectively enforce contractual or legal rights or intellectual property rights in certain
jurisdictions under which Bitdeer operates;
changes in a specific country or region’s political or economic conditions or policies; and
governmental policies favoring domestic companies in certain foreign markets or trade barriers
including export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and charges. In particular, there
have been concerns over the worldwide populism trend that call for protectionism trade policy and
potential international trade disputes, all of which could cause turbulence in the international markets.
These government policies or trade barriers could increase the prices of Bitdeer’s products and
services and make Bitdeer less competitive in such countries.
If Bitdeer is unable to effectively manage these risks, Bitdeer ability to operate and expand its business
will be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.
As Bitdeer continues to expand and localize its international activities, its obligations to comply with the laws, rules,
regulations and policies of a variety of jurisdictions will increase and it may be subject to investigations and
enforcement actions by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities.
As Bitdeer expands and localizes its international activities, it has become increasingly obligated to
comply with the laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations not only the jurisdictions in which
it operates but also those into which it offers services on a cross-border basis. Laws regulating financial
services, the internet, mobile technologies, crypto, and related technologies outside the United States often
impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on Bitdeer, as well as broader liability.
Regulators worldwide frequently study each other’s approaches to the regulation of the crypto
economy. Consequently, developments in any jurisdiction may influence other jurisdictions. New
developments in one jurisdiction may be extended to additional services and other jurisdictions. As a result,
the risks created by any new law or regulation in one jurisdiction are magnified by the potential that they
may be replicated, affecting Bitdeer’s business in another place or involving another service. Conversely, if
regulations diverge worldwide, Bitdeer may face difficulty adjusting its products, services, and other aspects
of its business with the same effect. These risks are heightened as Bitdeer faces increased competitive
pressure from other similarly situated businesses that engage in regulatory arbitrage to avoid the compliance
costs associated with regulatory changes.
The complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled
with the global scope of Bitdeer’s operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in
a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings
by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in
the aggregate, harm Bitdeer’s reputation, damage its brands and business, and adversely affect its operating
results and financial condition. Due to the uncertain application of existing laws and regulations, it is
possible that, despite Bitdeer’s regulatory and legal analysis concluding that certain products and services
are currently unregulated, such products or services may indeed be subject to financial regulation, licensing,
or authorization obligations that Bitdeer has not obtained or with which it has not complied. As a result,
Bitdeer is at a heightened risk of enforcement action, litigation, regulatory, and legal scrutiny which could
lead to sanctions,
56 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cease, and desist orders, or other penalties and censures which could significantly and adversely affect its
continued operations and financial condition.
Delays in the expansion of existing mining datacenters or the construction of new mining datacenters or significant
cost overruns could present significant risks to Bitdeer’s business and could have a material adverse effect on
Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The daily operations of all Bitdeer’s business lines require the support of its mining datacenters, with a
highly specialized infrastructure and considerable, reliable power in order to compete effectively. Bitdeer
intends to increase its mining capacity and increase substantially the number of mining machines Bitdeer
operates. In order to meet its financial plan, Bitdeer needs to expand its existing mining datacenters or obtain
suitable land to build new mining datacenters. Bitdeer may face challenges in obtaining suitable land, as
Bitdeer needs to work closely with the local power suppliers and local governments of the places where
Bitdeer’s proposed facilitates are located. Delays in actions that require the assistance of such third parties,
in receiving required permits and approvals or in mediations with local communities, if any, may negatively
impact Bitdeer’s construction timelines and budget or result in any new facilities not being completed at all.
Bitdeer plans to expand its footprints to six mining datacenters across the globe to increase Bitdeer’s
total capacity to approximately 1,374MW, including 452MW power supply currently under construction and
400MW power supply “in the pipeline,” contracted but not yet under active construction. Such expansion
and construction require Bitdeer to rely on the experience of one or more designers, general contractors and
subcontractors, and such designers or contractors may experience financial or other problems during the
design or construction process. Bitdeer may also experience quality control issues as Bitdeer implements any
upgrades in its hosting capacity through the installation and maintenance of chipsets and servers or new
cooling technologies such as immersion and water curtain cooling. Bitdeer’s business will be negatively
impacted if Bitdeer is unable to run its mining operations in a way that is technologically advanced,
economically and energy-efficient and temperature controlled. If Bitdeer is unsuccessful, it will damage its
mining machines and the mining machines of third parties and the profitability of its mining operations.
If Bitdeer experiences significant delays in the supply of power required to support any mining
datacenter expansion or construction, the progress of such projects could deviate from Bitdeer’s original
plans, which could cause material and negative effects on Bitdeer’s revenue growth, profitability and results
of operations. Any material delay in completing these projects, or any substantial cost increases or quality
issues in connection with these projects, could materially delay Bitdeer’s ability to supply cloud hash rate
and deliver its hosting capacity, cause Bitdeer to incur penalties under hosting contracts, result in reduced
order volume and materially adversely affect Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Any failure of Bitdeer’s solutions or services to meet the necessary quality standards could adversely affect Bitdeer’s
reputation, business and results of operation.
The quality of the products and services Bitdeer is providing is critical to the success of its business
and depends significantly on the effectiveness of Bitdeer’s and Bitdeer’s manufacturing service providers’
quality control systems. In its efforts to quickly meet new market trends and demand and adopt new
technologies, Bitdeer’s products and services may not have adequate time to go through Bitdeer’s normal
rigorous testing procedures and final inspection, which could result in instances where Bitdeer’s products
and services cannot reach the required performance standard, or Bitdeer’s products and services are found
to be defective or significantly unsatisfying. These instances could result in Bitdeer’s customers suffering
losses. Defects detected before products and services performance to Bitdeer’s customers may result in
additional costs for remediation and rework. Defects detected after the performance of Bitdeer’s products
and services may result in Bitdeer’s incurring further costs relating to inspection, installation or remediation,
which may result in damages to Bitdeer’s reputation, loss of customers, government fines and disputes and
litigation.
On the other hand, Bitdeer may have to turn to less reputable suppliers if Bitdeer cannot source
adequate equipment or other supplies from its regular suppliers. Under such circumstances, the quality of
the equipment may suffer and could cause performance issues in Bitdeer’s products and services. Shortages
of supplies could result in reduced production or delays in production, as well as an increase in costs, which
may negatively affect Bitdeer’s abilities to fulfill orders or provide timely services to customers, as well as
Bitdeer’s customer relationships and profitability. Supplies shortages may also increase Bitdeer’s costs of
revenue because it may
57 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
be required to pay higher prices for products in short supply, without being able to pass such cost to
customers. As a result, Bitdeer’s business, results of operations and reputation could be materially and
adversely affected.
Power outage or shortages, labor disputes and other factors may result in constraints on Bitdeer’s business
activities.
Historically, Bitdeer has not experienced constraints on its business activities, including at its mining
datacenters, due to power outage or shortages, labor disputes or other factors. However, there can be no
assurance that Bitdeer’s operations will not be affected by power outage or shortages, labor disputes or
other factors in the future, thereby causing material disruptions and delays in Bitdeer’s delivery schedule. In
such an event, Bitdeer’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected.
If Bitdeer is unable to maintain or enhance its brand recognition, its business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Maintaining and enhancing the recognition, image and acceptance of Bitdeer’s brand are important to
Bitdeer’s ability to differentiate its products and services from and to compete effectively with its peers. As
Bitdeer relies heavily on word-of-mouth branding, Bitdeer’s brand image could be jeopardized if it fails to
maintain high product and service quality, pioneer and keep pace with evolving technology trends, or timely
fulfil the orders for its products and services. If Bitdeer fails to promote its brand or to maintain or enhance
the brand recognition and awareness among Bitdeer’s customers, or if Bitdeer is subject to events or
negative allegations affecting its brand image or publicly perceived position of its brand, Bitdeer’s business,
operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Bitdeer may be at a higher risk of litigation and other legal proceedings due to heightened regulatory scrutiny of the
cryptocurrency industry, which could ultimately be resolved against Bitdeer, requiring material future cash
payments or charges, and accordingly impair Bitdeer’s financial condition and results of operations.
The size, nature and complexity of Bitdeer’s business could make it susceptible to various claims, both
in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings, legal proceedings, and government investigations, due to
the heightened regulatory scrutiny following the recent disruptions in the crypto asset markets. Bitdeer
believes that since cryptocurrency mining, and the digital asset industry generally, is a relatively new
business sector, it is more likely subject to government investigation and regulatory determination,
particularly following the recent cryptocurrency market participant bankruptcies described elsewhere herein.
Any claims, regulatory proceedings or litigation that could arise in the course of Bitdeer’s business could
have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer, its business or operations, or the industry as a whole.
Bitdeer may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights, which
could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer may not be able to obtain broad protection in Singapore, the United States or internationally for
all of its existing and future intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and Bitdeer may not be able to
obtain effective protection for its intellectual property and other proprietary rights in every country in which
Bitdeer operates. Protecting Bitdeer’s intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights may require
significant expenditure of its financial, managerial and operational resources. Moreover, the steps that
Bitdeer may take to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to
protect such rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating such rights. Any of Bitdeer’s
intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights, whether registered, unregistered, issued or
unissued, may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative proceedings and/or litigation.
Bitdeer may be required to spend significant resources to secure, maintain, monitor and protect its
intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. Despite its efforts, Bitdeer may not be able to
prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating Bitdeer’s intellectual
property rights and other proprietary rights. Bitdeer may initiate claims, administrative proceedings and/or
litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of its intellectual property rights or
other proprietary rights to enforce and/or maintain the validity of such rights. Any such action, if initiated,
whether or not it is resolved in Bitdeer’s favor, could result in significant expense to Bitdeer, and divert the
efforts of its
58

TABLE OF CONTENTS
technical and management personnel, which may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer may face intellectual property infringement claims or other related disputes, which could be time-
consuming, costly to defend or settle and result in the loss of significant rights and lower sales.
As is typical in the cryptocurrency industry, Bitdeer may be subject to infringement claims from time to
time or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by
other parties that may cover some of Bitdeer’s technology, products and services. The cryptocurrency
industry is characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual property
rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce these rights. Patent litigation has increased in recent
years owing to increased assertions made by intellectual property licensing entities and increasing
competition and overlap of product functionality in Bitdeer’s markets. Additionally, Bitdeer has in the past
entered and may continue in the future to enter into licensing agreements with third parties for the use of
their proprietary technologies, primarily software development tools, in the development of Bitdeer’s
products and services. As with any business relationship, Bitdeer may face disputes and lawsuits related to
those intellectual property licensing agreements. As its operations continue to grow in size and scale, the
likelihood of Bitdeer becoming involved in intellectual property related lawsuits and disputes to protect or
defend its intellectual property rights and the use of third-party intellectual property rights will increase.
In addition, it is extremely difficult for Bitdeer to monitor all of the patent applications that have been
filed in the United States or in other countries or regions and whether, if such pending patents are granted,
such patents would have a material and adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business if Bitdeer’s service offering
were to infringe upon them.
Other third parties may file claims against Bitdeer or its customers alleging that Bitdeer’s products and
services, processes, or technologies infringe third-party patents or IP rights. Regardless of their merits or
resolutions, such claims could be costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of
Bitdeer’s management and technical personnel. In addition, some of Bitdeer’s customer agreements in the
future may require Bitdeer to indemnify and defend its customers from third-party infringement claims and to
pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. As such, claims of this sort also could harm Bitdeer’s
relationships with its customers and may deter future customers from doing business with Bitdeer. Bitdeer
does not know whether Bitdeer could prevail in any such proceeding given the complex technical issues and
inherent uncertainties involved in intellectual property litigation. If any pending or future proceedings result
in an adverse outcome, Bitdeer could be required to:
cease the use of the infringing equipment, processes or technologies;
stop providing products and services to certain geographic areas;
pay substantial damages for infringement;
expend significant resources to develop non-infringing processes, technologies or products;
license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all;
cross-license Bitdeer’s technology to a competitor in order to resolve an infringement claim, which
could weaken Bitdeer’s ability to compete with that competitor; or
pay substantial damages to Bitdeer’s customers to disruption of products and services they
subscribed or replace the type of series with non-infringing equipment involved.
Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The loss of any member of Bitdeer’s senior management team, or Bitdeer’s failure to attract, train and retain
qualified personnel, especially its design and technical personnel, could impair Bitdeer’s ability to grow its business
and effectively execute its business strategy.
Since its inception, the growth and expansion of Bitdeer’s business operations have been dependent
upon the business strategies and foresight of Bitdeer’s senior management. Bitdeer’s future success
depends, in a
59 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
large part, on the continued contributions of its senior management team, specifically Mr. Jihan Wu. In
addition, Bitdeer’s future success depends on its ability to retain, attract and incentivize qualified personnel,
including its management, sales, marketing, finance and especially research and development personnel. As
the driver of Bitdeer’s technological and product innovations, Bitdeer’s research and development personnel
represent a very significant asset of Bitdeer’s. As the technology in the cryptocurrency industry is
advancing at a quick pace, there is an increasing need for skilled engineers. Many companies across the
world are struggling to find suitable candidates for their research and development positions. The process of
hiring employees with the combination of skills and characteristics required to implement Bitdeer’s strategy
can be extremely competitive and time-consuming. Bitdeer cannot assure you that it will be able to attract
adequate personnel as Bitdeer continues to pursue its business strategies.
Moreover, there is no assurance that Bitdeer will be able to retain key existing employees. The loss of
any of Bitdeer’s founder, senior management or research and development team members could harm it
ability to implement it business strategies and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which it
operates, or could result in other operating risks. The loss of one or more of Bitdeer’s key employees,
especially its key design and technical personnel, or its inability to retain, attract and motivate qualified
designs and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer may be vulnerable to security breaches, which could disrupt its operations and have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
A party who is able to compromise the physical security measures protecting Bitdeer’s facilities could
cause interruptions or malfunctions in Bitdeer’s operations and misappropriate Bitdeer’s property or the
property of its customers. Such a compromise could be particularly harmful to Bitdeer’s brand and
reputation. Bitdeer may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such
threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security. As techniques used to breach security
change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, Bitdeer may not be able to
implement new security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, Bitdeer may not be certain
whether these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose Bitdeer to
increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, harm to Bitdeer’s
reputation and increases in Bitdeer’s security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, any assertions of alleged security breaches or systems failure made against Bitdeer,
whether true or not, could harm its reputation, cause Bitdeer to incur substantial legal fees and have a
material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Whether or not
any such assertion actually develops into litigation, Bitdeer’s management may be required to devote
significant time and attention to dispute resolution (through litigation, settlement or otherwise), which would
detract from Bitdeer’s management’s ability to focus on its business. Any such resolution could involve the
payment of damages or expenses by Bitdeer, which may be significant. In addition, any such resolution
could involve Bitdeer’s agreement with terms that restrict the operation of its business. Any such resolution,
including the resources exhausted in connection therewith, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent
concern in the Bitcoin exchange market since the launch of the Bitcoin network. Any security breach caused
by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause
intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and
the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses, could harm Bitdeer’s business operations or result in loss
of Bitdeer’s assets.
Bitdeer may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.
The threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite Bitdeer’s
efforts and processes to prevent breaches, its computer servers and computer systems may be vulnerable to
cybersecurity risks, including denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or
60 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
misuse and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with Bitdeer’s computer servers and computer
systems. The preventive actions Bitdeer takes to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect its
information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber-attack in the future. To the
extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to Bitdeer’s network, in
unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or in a loss of Bitdeer’s cryptocurrencies, it could cause
significant damage to its reputation, lead to claims against it and ultimately have a material adverse effect on
Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, Bitdeer may be required to
incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the
future.
Bitdeer may engage in acquisitions or strategic alliances in the future that could disrupt Bitdeer’s business, result in
increased expenses, reduce Bitdeer’s financial resources and cause dilution to Bitdeer’s shareholders. Bitdeer
cannot assure you that such acquisitions or strategic alliances may be successfully implemented.
Although Bitdeer has not engaged in acquisitions or strategic alliances in the past, it may look for
potential acquisitions or strategic alliances in the future to expand its business. However, Bitdeer may not be
able to find suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, or integrate
any acquired business, products or technologies into Bitdeer’s operations. If Bitdeer does complete
acquisitions, they may be viewed negatively by customers or investors and they may not enable Bitdeer to
strengthen its competitive position or achieve its goals. In addition, any acquisitions that Bitdeer makes
could lead to difficulties in integrating personnel, technologies and operations from the acquired businesses
and in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses. Moreover, acquisitions may disrupt
Bitdeer’s ongoing operations, divert management from day-to-day responsibilities and increase Bitdeer’s
expenses. Future acquisitions may reduce Bitdeer’s cash available for operations and other uses, and could
result in increases in amortization expenses related to identifiable intangible assets acquired, potentially
dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt. Bitdeer cannot predict the number, timing or
size of future acquisitions, or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on Bitdeer’s operating results.
Any global systemic economic and financial crisis could negatively affect Bitdeer’s business, results of operations,
and financial condition.
Any prolonged slowdown in the global economy may have a negative impact on Bitdeer’s business,
results of operations and financial condition. The global financial markets have experienced significant
disruptions since 2008 and the United States, Europe and other economies have experienced periods of
recession. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and
fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading
economies, including the United States. There have also been concerns over unrest in Ukraine, the Middle
East and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in financial and other markets, and concerns over the
aftermath of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union as well as the significant potential changes to
United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs. There were and could be in the future a number of domino
effects from such turmoil on Bitdeer’s business, including significant decreases in orders from its customers,
insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, inability of customers to obtain credit to finance
purchases of Bitdeer’s products and services and/or customer insolvencies, and counterparty failures
negatively impacting Bitdeer’s operations. Any systemic economic or financial crisis could cause revenue for
the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically and could materially and adversely affect
Bitdeer’s results of operations.
Changes in international trade policies and international barriers to trade may have an adverse effect on Bitdeer’s
business and expansion plans.
Bitdeer has provided worldwide products and services to a number of countries outside of Singapore
and derive sales from exporting to those countries, and Bitdeer intends to continue to sell its current and
future products to countries outside of Singapore. Revenue generated from customers located in the United
States accounted for 12%, 17%, 19% and 6% of Bitdeer’s total revenue for the years ended December 31,
2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Further, Bitdeer relies on
certain overseas suppliers, including suppliers in the United States, for the supply of certain equipment and
tools, such as mining machines. Changes to trade policies, treaties and tariffs in or affecting the jurisdictions
in which Bitdeer operates and to which Bitdeer sells its products and services, or the perception that these
changes could occur,
61 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
could adversely affect the financial and economic conditions in those jurisdictions, as well as Bitdeer’s
international sales, financial condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer’s business and prospect may be negatively affected by changes in governmental policies
including sanctions and export controls administered by other countries’ governments, including those
imposed as a result of an increasing tense relationship of the political or economic relations among major
economic groups and other geopolitical challenges. Although Bitdeer currently only operates its business in
certain countries, there is no assurance that the governmental authorities may take certain possible measures
or restrictions towards the products and services Bitdeer is providing or will provide, which could result in
an adverse impact on Bitdeer’s business and prospect if Bitdeer were not able to find substitute customer
group with the same quality demand from other countries. Further, some of Bitdeer’s customers may
experience undue hardship in purchasing or furthering the business relationship with it as a result of the
abnormal international trade relations, which could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business
performance.
In addition, countries, which are subject to other countries’ sanctions or tariff impositions may further
retaliate, in response to new trade policies implemented by such foreign governments. Such retaliation
measures may further escalate the tensions between the two countries, which may have a negative impact on
the economies of not merely the two countries concerned, but the global economy as a whole. As a result of
any major economic downturn, Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
Bitdeer’s prepayments to suppliers may subject it to counterparty risk associated with such suppliers and negatively
affect Bitdeer’s liquidity and cash position.
Bitdeer is required to prepay some of its suppliers before the service is provided to secure the supplier’s
production capacity. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021 and June 30, 2022, the balance of prepayments
Bitdeer made to its suppliers amounted to US$5.8 million, US$14.5 million and US$13.7 million, respectively.
The amount of Bitdeer’s prepayment can significantly increase as it continues to pursue technological
advancement. Bitdeer is subject to counterparty risk exposure to its suppliers. Any failure by Bitdeer’s
suppliers to perform their contractual obligation in a timely manner and/or with Bitdeer’s requested quality
may result in it not being able to fulfill customers’ orders accordingly. In such an event, Bitdeer may not be
able to regain the prepayment in a timely manner or in full, even though Bitdeer’s suppliers are obligated to
return such prepayments under specified circumstances as previously agreed upon. Furthermore, if the cash
outflows for the prepayments significantly exceed the cash inflows during any period, Bitdeer’s future
liquidity position will be adversely affected.
Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change may result in environmental taxes, charges,
assessments or penalties and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.
The effects of human activity on global climate change have attracted considerable public and scientific
attention, as well as the attention of the United States and other foreign governments. Efforts are being made
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly those from coal combustion power plants, some of which
plants Bitdeer may rely upon for power. The added cost of any environmental taxes, charges, assessments or
penalties levied on such power plants could be passed on to Bitdeer, increasing the cost to run Bitdeer’s
hosting facilities.
On November 23, 2022, the governor of New York signed into law a two year moratorium on new or
renewed permits for certain electricity-generating facilities that use fossil fuel and provide energy for proof-
of-work digital asset mining operations. While this action does not directly impact Bitdeer’s current
operations, it may be the beginning of a new wave of climate change regulations aimed at preventing or
reducing the growth of Bitcoin mining in jurisdictions in the United States, including potentially jurisdictions
in which Bitdeer now operates or may in the future operate. Such action could also demonstrate the
beginning of a regional or global regulatory trend in response to environmental and energy preservation or
other concerns surrounding crypto assets, and similar action in a jurisdiction in which Bitdeer operates or in
general could have a devastating effect on its operations. Any further enactment of laws or promulgations of
regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the United States, Norway, or any other domestic or
foreign jurisdiction

in which Bitdeer conducts business could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition or results of operations.
If Bitdeer experiences difficulty in collecting its trade receivables, its liquidity, financial condition and results of
operations would be negatively impacted.
Bitdeer derives its revenue from the sale of products and services and is subject to counterparty risks
such as its customer’s inability to pay. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, and June 30, 2022, Bitdeer’s trade
receivables amounted to US$0.4 million, US$8.2 million, and US$20.7 million respectively. There can be no
assurance that Bitdeer will be able to collect its trade receivables on a timely basis, and its trade receivable
turnover days may increase, which in turn could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer’s liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer’s operations and those of its production partners and customers are vulnerable to natural disasters and
other events beyond Bitdeer’s control, the occurrence of which may have an adverse effect on the supply chain of
Bitdeer’s suppliers and on Bitdeer’s facilities, personnel and results of operations.
Bitdeer’s business could be adversely affected by natural disasters or outbreaks of epidemics. Bitdeer
has not adopted any written contingency plans to combat any future natural disasters, such as floods and
mudslides, or outbreaks of avian flu, H1N1 flu, SARS or any other epidemic. These natural disasters,
outbreaks of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments in countries where
Bitdeer’s computing power facilities are located or any other countries or regions in which Bitdeer conducts
business could severely disrupt its business operations by damaging Bitdeer’s network infrastructure or
information technology system or impacting the productivity of Bitdeer’s workforce, which may adversely
affect its financial condition and results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a significantly negative impact on the global economy, industry and market
conditions. The ongoing development and the global control on the pandemic are unclear, which may increase the
instability of Bitdeer’s development, materially and adversely affecting Bitdeer’s results of operations.
Since December 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 has
materially and adversely affected the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused series of
consequences from many perspectives and may continue to have a prolonged impact by:
impairing Bitdeer’s ability to renew and maintain its relationships with existing customers;
causing Bitdeer’s existing customers to substantially reduce the quantity of products and services to
which they subscribe, seek price concessions, or go out of business, any of which would harm
Bitdeer’s revenue;
resulting in some of Bitdeer’s customers failing to comply with the terms of their agreements,
including payment terms, due to economic uncertainty, financial hardship, and even failure of their
businesses, which could result in Bitdeer being required to take action to collect payments, terminate
their subscriptions for Bitdeer’s services, and increase accounts receivable and bad debt, any of
which would increase Bitdeer’s expenses and harm Bitdeer’s revenue and results of operations;
making it more difficult for Bitdeer to sell increased services or functionality to its existing customers;
delaying prospective customers’ decisions to subscribe to Bitdeer’s solutions, increase the length of
sales cycles, or slow the typical growth in the use of Bitdeer’s solutions once customers have initially

impacting the health and safety of Bitdeer’s employees, including its senior management team, and
their ability to perform services;
causing Bitdeer’s management team to continue to commit significant time, attention and resources to
monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to mitigate its effect on Bitdeer’s business and
workforce.
It is uncertain how long and how severely the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact Bitdeer.
Significant uncertainties associated with the coronavirus remain, including with respect to the availability
and efficacy of vaccines, the duration of the pandemic, the emergence of variant strains of COVID-19, and
actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the coronavirus or to treat its impact. The
full impact of the coronavirus is unknown at this time. If the pandemic continues and lasts for a prolonged
period in the regions where Bitdeer operates, such as cases resurgence in certain areas, the economy could
suffer substantially from the measures and restrictions taken to combat the virus, which would, in turn, have
an adverse impact on Bitdeer’s business prospects. Any significant disruption resulting from this or similar
epidemics on a large scale or over a prolonged period of time could significantly interrupt Bitdeer’s business
until it would be able to resume normal business operations, which will negatively affect Bitdeer’s financial
condition. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of
operations, it may also heighten some of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.
Risks Related to Cryptocurrencies
Because there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the
determinations that Bitdeer has made for how to account for cryptocurrencies transactions may be subject to
change.
The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to
interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”), the SEC, and various bodies
formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or
interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and may even affect the
reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Further, there
has been limited precedents for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related valuation and
revenue recognition, and no official guidance has been provided by the IASB or the SEC. As such, there
remains significant uncertainty on how companies can account for cryptocurrency transactions,
cryptocurrencies, and related revenue. Uncertainties in or changes to in regulatory or financial accounting
standards could result in the need to changing our accounting methods and restate our financial statements
and impair our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could adversely affect our
financial statements, result in a loss of investor confidence, and more generally impact our business,
operating results, and financial condition.
Any loss or destruction of a private key required to access a cryptocurrency of Bitdeer’s is irreversible. Bitdeer also
may temporarily lose access to its cryptocurrencies.
Cryptocurrencies are each accessible and controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public
key and private key associated with the cryptocurrency, wherein the public and private keys are held in an
offline or online digital wallet. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no
backup of the private key is available, Bitdeer will be unable to access the applicable cryptocurrency
associated with that private key and the private key cannot be restored. As a result, any cryptocurrencies
associated with such key could be irretrievably lost. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used
to store the applicable cryptocurrencies could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
In addition, Bitdeer may temporarily lose access to its cryptocurrencies as a result of software or
systems upgrades or maintenance. In this case, Bitdeer would likely rely on third parties to assist in restoring
its access, and there is no assurance such third parties will be able to restore access on a timely basis, or at
all. Any temporary loss, if it occurs, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Bitcoin exchanges and wallets, and to a lesser extent, the Bitcoin network itself, may suffer from hacking and fraud
risks, which may adversely erode user confidence in Bitcoin which would decrease the demand for Bitdeer’s
products and services. Further, digital asset exchanges on which crypto assets trade are relatively new and largely
unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Incorrect or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may
be irreversible.
Bitcoin transactions are entirely digital and, as with any virtual system, are at risk from hackers, malware
and operational glitches. Hackers can target Bitcoin exchanges and Bitcoin transactions, to gain access to
thousands of accounts and digital wallets where Bitcoins are stored. Bitcoin transactions and accounts are
not insured by any type of government program and all Bitcoin transactions are permanent because there is
no third party or payment processor. Bitcoin has suffered from hacking and cyber-theft as such incidents
have been reported by several cryptocurrency exchanges and miners, highlighting concerns about the
security of Bitcoin and therefore affecting its demand and price.
To the extent that cryptocurrency exchanges or other trading venues are involved in fraud or experience
security failures or other operational issues, a reduction in cryptocurrency prices could occur.
Cryptocurrency market prices depend, directly or indirectly, on the prices set on exchanges and other trading
venues, which are new and, in most cases, largely unregulated as compared to established, regulated
exchanges for securities, derivatives and other currencies. For example, during the past three years, a number
of Bitcoin exchanges have been closed due to fraud, business failure or security breaches. In many of these
instances, the customers of the closed Bitcoin exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the
partial or complete losses of their account balances in such Bitcoin exchanges. Also, the price and exchange
of Bitcoin may be affected due to fraud risk. While Bitcoin uses private key encryption to verify owners and
register transactions, fraudsters and scammers may attempt to sell false Bitcoins. All of the above may
adversely affect the operation of the Bitcoin network which would erode user confidence in Bitcoin, which
would negatively affect demand for Bitdeer’s products and services. In addition, smaller exchanges are less
likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that provide larger exchanges with additional stability,
larger exchanges may be more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and “malware”  (i.e., software used or
programmed by attackers to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to
private computer systems) and may be more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action.

computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems) and may be
more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action.
Further, digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and, in most cases,
largely unregulated. Many digital exchanges do not provide the public with significant information regarding
their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the
marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges,
including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. During
2022, a number of companies in the crypto industry have declared bankruptcy, including Compute North,
Core Scientific, Alameda Research LLC, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows, BlockFi, and FTX.
In June 2022, Celsius began pausing all withdrawals and transfers between accounts on its platform, and in
July 2022, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Further, in November 2022, FTX, one of the major
cryptocurrency exchanges, also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Such bankruptcies have contributed, at least
in part, to further price decreases in Bitcoin, a loss of confidence in the participants of the digital asset
ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly, and other participants and
entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected. These events
have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital assets markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX
engaged in significant trading activity.
Bitdeer has not been directly impacted by any of the recent bankruptcies in the crypto asset space, as it
has no contractual privity or relationship to the relevant parties. However, Bitdeer is dependent on the
overall
65 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
crypto assets industry, and such recent events have contributed, at least in part, to its peers’ stock price as
well as the price of Bitcoin. If the liquidity of the digital assets markets continues to be negatively impacted,
digital asset prices (including the price of Bitcoin) may continue to experience significant volatility and
confidence in the digital asset markets may be further undermined. A perceived lack of stability in the digital
asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business
failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital
asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a
digital asset exchange’s failure could adversely affect an investment in Bitdeer, discourage overall
participation in the cryptocurrency industry, and result in loss of customer demand for Bitdeer’s products
and services. Cryptocurrency investments may be subject to losses or impairments if cryptocurrency values
decrease as a result of failure of any digital asset exchange, however, Bitdeer does not anticipate to actively
participate in such activities in the foreseeable future.
Bitdeer may not have adequate sources of recovery if the cryptocurrencies held by it are lost, stolen or destroyed due
to third-party cryptocurrencies custodial services or if Bitdeer cannot redeem or withdraw its cryptocurrencies
invested in crypto lending or investing activities. Such incidents could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Substantially all of Bitdeer’s cryptocurrencies were held in custody by Matrix Finance and Technologies
Holding Group and its subsidiaries (“Matrixport Group”), a related party, and Bitdeer’s disposal of
cryptocurrencies, at spot price on the date of disposal, was primarily to Matrixport Group. For more details
on Bitdeer’s custody agreements with Matrixport Group, see the section entitled “Information Related to
Bitdeer - Our Cryptocurrencies - Our Cryptocurrencies Storage and Custodial Practices - Agreements Related
to Our Cryptocurrencies Storage and Custodial Practices.” Bitdeer believes that the security procedures that
Matrixport Group utilizes, such as issuing username, password and hardware tokens, are reasonably
designed to safeguard its Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from theft, loss, destruction or other issues
relating to hackers and technological attack. Nevertheless, the security procedures cannot guarantee the
prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by Bitdeer.
If such cryptocurrencies are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a third party liable to
Bitdeer, it is possible that Matrixport Group may not have the financial resources or insurance sufficient to
satisfy any or all of Bitdeer’s claims against the third party, or have the ability to retrieve, restore or replace
the lost, stolen or destroyed cryptocurrencies due to governing network protocols and the strength of the
cryptographic systems associated with such cryptocurrencies. To the extent that Bitdeer is unable to recover
on any of its claims against any such third party, such loss could have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition and results of operations.
If such services are commercially available, we will consider adding regulated banks, rather than solely
relying on crypto custodian, as the custodian for a material amount of our cryptocurrencies. Obtaining
cryptocurrency custody services from a regulated bank may confer benefits such as improved security and
reduced fraud. Nevertheless, until now, banks have generally declined to provide custody services for
cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets, due to the absence of clarity on permissibility and on regulators’
views of these activities generally. On July 22, 2020, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
released publicly an interpretive letter confirming the authority of a national bank to provide cryptocurrency
custody services for customers, providing that a national bank engaging in such activities should develop
and implement those activities consistent with sound risk management practices and align them with the
bank’s overall business plans and strategies as set forth in the guidance. On January 27, 2023, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System released publicly a policy statement to interpret section 9(13) of
the Federal Reserve Act, clarifying that the state member banks are not prohibited under the policy from
providing safekeeping services for crypto-assets in a custodial capacity, if such activities are conducted in a
safe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer, anti-money-laundering, and anti-terrorist-financing
laws. However, it will take time for banks to start offering cryptocurrencies custodian services, and before
then, we may have to continue to rely on crypto custodians, such as Matrixport Group, for our crypto
custodian needs.
Bitdeer has also lent cryptocurrency loans to Matrixport Group and purchased cryptocurrency wealth
management products from Matrixport Group. See the section entitled “Information Related to Bitdeer - Our
Cryptocurrencies” for more information. Historically, Bitdeer has not incurred or been exposed to any losses
as a result of its relationship and transactions with Matrixport Group, and has never experienced
66 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any excessive redemptions, withdrawals, or a suspension of redemptions or withdrawals, of crypto assets
from Matrixport Group or other exchanges or platforms. Participation in cryptocurrency lending and/or
investment may subject Bitdeer to counterparty risk, which may result in Bitdeer losing part or all of its
cryptocurrencies lent or invested. To further limit its counterparty risk, Bitdeer does not anticipate to engage
in crypto lending or investing activities in the foreseeable future.
Any material transaction between Bitdeer and Matrixport Group or its subsidiaries is subject to
Bitdeer’s related person transaction policy. To the extent Bitdeer fails to appropriately deal with any such
conflicts of interests, it could negatively impact Bitdeer’s reputation, the ability to raise additional funds and
the willingness of counterparties to do business with Bitdeer, all of which could have adverse effect on
Bitdeer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The “halving” of rewards available on the Bitcoin network, or the reduction of rewards on other networks, has had
and in the future could have a negative impact on Bitdeer’s ability to generate revenue as its customers may not
have an adequate incentive to continue transaction processing and customers may cease transaction processing
operations altogether, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.
Under the current protocols governing the Bitcoin network, the reward for validating a new block on
that network is cut in half from time to time, which has been referred to in Bitdeer’s industry as the “halving.”
When the Bitcoin network was first launched, the reward for validating a new block was 50 Bitcoin. In
November 2012, the reward for validating a new block was reduced to 25 Bitcoin. In July 2016, the reward for
validating a new block was reduced to 12.5 Bitcoin, and in May 2020, the reward was further reduced to 6.25
Bitcoin. The next halving for Bitcoin is expected in 2024 at block 840,000, when the reward will reduce to
3.125. In addition, other networks may operate under rules that, or may alter their rules to, limit the
distribution of new cryptocurrencies. Bitdeer, and to Bitdeer’s knowledge, its potential hosting customers,
currently rely on these rewards to generate a significant portion of Bitdeer’s total revenue. If the award of
cryptocurrencies for solving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, neither Bitdeer nor its
customers may have an adequate incentive to continue transaction processing and may cease transaction
processing operations altogether, which as a result may significantly reduce demand for Bitdeer’s hosting
services. As a result, the halving of available rewards on the Bitcoin network, or any reduction of rewards on
other networks, would have a negative impact on Bitdeer’s revenue and may have a material adverse effect
on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the reduction of rewards may reduce Bitdeer’s profit margins, which could result in Bitdeer
selling a substantial portion of its cryptocurrencies, which are subject to high volatility. If Bitdeer is forced
to sell cryptocurrencies at low prices, it could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Malicious actors or botnet may obtain control of more than 50% of the processing power on the Bitcoin or other
cryptocurrency network.
If a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked
software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to
mining on the Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency network, it may be able to alter the blockchain on which the
Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency network and most Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency transactions rely by
constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at
all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude, or modify the ordering of transactions, though it
could not generate new cryptocurrencies or transactions using such control. The malicious actor could
“double-spend” its own cryptocurrencies (i.e., spend the same cryptocurrencies in more than one
transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users’ transactions for so long as it maintained control. To
the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the
cryptocurrency network, or the cryptocurrency community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious,
reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible.
Although there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of the Bitcoin blockchain achieved
through controlling over 50% of the processing power on the network, it is believed that certain mining
pools may have exceeded the 50% threshold. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicates a greater
risk in
67 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of Bitcoin transactions. To the extent that
the cryptocurrency ecosystems, including developers and administrators of mining pools, do not act to
ensure greater decentralization of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency mining processing power, the feasibility of
a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power on the cryptocurrency network will increase,
which may adversely affect an investment in Bitdeer.
If there are significant changes to the method of validating blockchain transactions, such changes could harm
Bitdeer’s proprietary mining business and reduce demand for Bitdeer’s products and services.
New cryptocurrency transaction protocols are continuously being deployed, and existing and new
protocols are in a state of constant change and development. While certain validation protocols currently
employ a PoW consensus algorithm, whereby miners are required to expend significant amounts of electrical
and computing power to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and create
new blocks in a blockchain, there may be a shift towards adopting alternative validating protocols. These
protocols may include a PoS algorithm, PoC algorithm or any other algorithm based on a protocol other than
PoW, which may decrease the reliance on computing power as an advantage to validating blocks. Bitdeer’s
proprietary mining operations, and, to Bitdeer’s knowledge, the operations of Bitdeer’s potential hash rate
sharing and hosting customers, are currently designed to primarily support a PoW consensus algorithm.
Should the algorithm shift from a PoW validation method to others, mining would require less energy and
may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from lower priced
electricity, processing, real estate or hosting) less competitive. As a result of Bitdeer’s efforts to optimize and
improve the efficiency of its cryptocurrency mining operations, Bitdeer may be exposed to the risk in the
future of losing the benefit of Bitdeer’s capital investments and the competitive advantage Bitdeer hopes to
gain from this as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to protocols other than PoW were to
occur. If Bitdeer cannot adapt to the new mining protocols quickly enough to keep pace with the market
change, any such change to transaction validating protocols could have a material adverse effect on
Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Growth in the popularity and use of other blockchain networks other than PoW cryptocurrency networks, may
adversely affect Bitdeer’s business.
A consensus algorithm is the mechanism through which a blockchain network reach consensus. There
are several types of consensus algorithms, the most common among which are Proof-of-Work (“PoW”),
Proof-of-Stake (“PoS”), Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (“DPoS”), Proof-of-Space-Time (“PoST”), and Proof-of-
Capacity (“PoC”). PoW is employed by Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, according to which miners
with higher computing power have better chances to find a valid solution for the next block. On the contrary,
according to PoS, the creator of a new block is chosen in a deterministic way based on his or her stake,
which is the number of coins he or she owns. As validation under PoS does not depend on computing
power, PoS reduces the need for electricity and mining hardware. DPoS works similarly to PoS except it
involves a voting and delegation mechanism to incentivize users to secure the network with their staked
collateral. PoST and PoC are consensus mechanism algorithm used in blockchains that allows for mining
devices in the network to use their available storage space and time to decide mining rights and validate
transactions. PoST and PoC emerged as some of the many alternative solutions to the problem of high
energy consumption in PoW systems and cryptocurrency hoarding in PoS systems.
Currently, the original PoW cryptocurrency network, Bitcoin, enjoys a first-to-market advantage over
other networks such as PoS networks and dominates the cryptocurrency markets as it was introduced by
Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2009, way earlier than other cryptocurrencies, and since then grew into the most
populator cryptocurrency. As of December 31, 2020, the market capitalization of Bitcoin was US$542,633.93
million, accounting for approximately 71% of the total capitalization of the global cryptocurrency market,
according to Frost & Sullivan. As of June 30, 2022, the market capitalization of Bitcoin was US$383,245.5
million, accounting for approximately 40% to 45% of the total capitalization of the global cryptocurrency
market, according to Frost & Sullivan. Bitcoin’s market capitalization and its share of the market
capitalization of all cryptocurrencies fluctuate as other cryptocurrencies were introduced to the digital assets
industry at a later time and became more mainstream for various reasons, and there is no guarantee that
Bitcoin or other PoW cryptocurrency networks, will continue to enjoy such market leading position and
could be is overtaken by another virtual asset. For example, as the cryptocurrency community continues to
develop and advance
68 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
PoS technologies, PoS networks may offer actual or perceived advantages over PoW networks. While
Bitdeer intends to enrich its product and service portfolio by providing mining services covering new crypto
protocols, including PoS, DPoS, PoST and PoC, and steadily increase the weight of new business to
diversify revenue streams and attract new customers who are users of these new crypto protocols, Bitdeer’s
services primarily support PoW protocol currently. Specifically, prior to the second half of 2021, Bitdeer’s
business was limited to PoW protocol only; commencing from the second half of 2021, Bitdeer started to
mine Filecoin, which adopted PoST protocol, on a proprietary basis, and to offer computing power sharing
solutions regarding Filecoin mining under its Cloud Hash Rate business. If preferences in the
cryptocurrency markets shift away from PoW networks and PoS networks achieve widespread adoption, it
could attract users away from Bitcoin and the other PoW cryptocurrencies Bitdeer mines and the PoW
related products mining services Bitdeer offers, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s
business and Bitdeer’s prospects or operations as there is no guarantee that Bitdeer will be able to adapt to
new businesses swiftly enough, if at all.
The acceptance of Bitcoin network software patches or upgrades by a significant, but not overwhelming, percentage
of the users and miners in the Bitcoin network could result in a “fork” in the blockchain, resulting in the operation
of two separate networks that cannot be merged. The existence of forked blockchains could erode user confidence in
Bitcoin and could adversely impact Bitdeer’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
Bitcoin is based on open-source software and has no official developer or group of developers that
formally controls the Bitcoin network. Any individual can download the Bitcoin network software and make
any desired modifications, which are proposed to users and miners on the Bitcoin network through software
downloads and upgrades. However, miners and users must consent to those software modifications by
downloading the altered software or upgrading and implementing the changes; otherwise, the changes do
not become part of the Bitcoin network. Since the Bitcoin network’s inception, changes to the Bitcoin
network have been accepted by the vast majority of users and miners, ensuring that the Bitcoin network
remains a coherent economic system. However, a developer or group of developers could potentially
propose a modification to the Bitcoin network that is not accepted by a vast majority of miners and users,
but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial population of participants in the Bitcoin network. In such a
case, a fork in the blockchain could develop and two separate Bitcoin networks could result, one running the
pre-modification software program and the other running the modified version. An example is the
introduction of a cryptocurrency known as “Bitcoin cash” in mid-2017. This kind of split in the Bitcoin
network could erode user confidence in the stability of the Bitcoin network, which could negatively affect
the demand for Bitdeer’s services.
Cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and, if stolen or incorrectly transferred, cryptocurrencies may be
irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed cryptocurrency transactions could have a material adverse effect
on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Typically, cryptocurrency transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without
the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a
majority of the processing power on the applicable network. Once a transaction has been confirmed and
verified in a block that is added to the network blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency or a
theft of a cryptocurrency generally will not be reversible and Bitdeer may not be capable of seeking
compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although transfers of any cryptocurrencies Bitdeer holds will
regularly be made to or from vendors, consultants, services providers, etc., it is possible that, through
computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, Bitdeer’s cryptocurrencies could be transferred
from itself in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that Bitdeer is unable to seek a
corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party that has received
Bitdeer’s cryptocurrencies through error or theft, Bitdeer will be unable to revert or otherwise recover
Bitdeer’s incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies. To the extent that Bitdeer is unable to seek redress for
such error or theft, such loss could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition
and results of operations.
The cryptocurrencies held by Bitdeer may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access, which could have
a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
There is a risk that some or all of the cryptocurrencies held or hosted by Bitdeer could be lost, stolen or
destroyed. Bitdeer believes that the cryptocurrencies held or hosted by itself and its mining operation will be
69 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage or steal Bitdeer’s
cryptocurrencies. Bitdeer’s security procedures and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the
actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of one of Bitdeer’s employees, or otherwise, and, as a result,
an unauthorized party may obtain access to Bitdeer’s cryptocurrency accounts, private keys, data or
cryptocurrencies. Although Bitdeer implements a number of security procedures with various elements such
as two-factor verification, segregated accounts and secured facilities and plans to implement the
maintenance of data on computers and/or storage media that is not directly connected to, or accessible from,
the internet and/or networked with other computers, or “cold storage,” to minimize the risk of loss, damage
and theft, and Bitdeer updates such security procedures whenever reasonably practicable, there is no
guarantee that the prevention of such loss, damage or theft, whether caused intentionally, accidentally or by
an act of God.
Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce Bitdeer’s employees to disclose
sensitive information in order to gain access to Bitdeer’s infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain
unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed
to remain dormant until a predetermined event, and often are not recognized until launched against a target,
Bitdeer may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. As
technological change occurs, the security threats to Bitdeer’s Bitcoin will likely adapt and previously
unknown threats may emerge. Bitdeer’s ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs
or trends may pose a challenge to the safekeeping of Bitdeer’s cryptocurrencies. To the extent Bitdeer is
unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, Bitdeer’s cryptocurrencies may be subject to
theft, loss, destruction or other attacks.
Any of these events could expose Bitdeer to liability, damage its reputation, reduce customer
confidence in Bitdeer’s products and services and otherwise have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s
business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, Bitdeer believes that as its assets grow,
Bitdeer may become a more appealing target for security threats, such as hackers and malware. If an actual or
perceived breach of Bitdeer’s cryptocurrency accounts occurs, the market perception of Bitdeer’s
effectiveness could be harmed.
The impact of geopolitical, economic or other events on the supply of and demand for cryptocurrencies is uncertain,
but could motivate large-scale sales of cryptocurrencies, which could result in a reduction in the price of such
cryptocurrencies and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.
As an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies, which are
relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative,
decentralized means of buying and selling goods and services. It is unclear how this supply and demand will
be impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless, political or economic crises may motivate large-scale
acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of cryptocurrencies
likely would result in a reduction in the price of the subject cryptocurrency and could have a material
adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the price of cryptocurrencies may be affected by the buying and selling of a significant
amount of cryptocurrencies by a holder, or a group of holders. Any unforeseen actions by holders of a
significant amount of cryptocurrencies, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction
settlement times and any mechanisms of increasing the scale of cryptocurrency settlement may significantly alter the
competitive dynamics in the market.
Many cryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction
settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling
cryptocurrencies, and particularly Bitcoin, is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a
means of payment, which is necessary to the growth and development of Bitdeer’s business.
Many cryptocurrency networks face significant scaling challenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are
limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. In this respect, Bitcoin may be
particularly affected as it relies on the PoW validation, which due to its inherent characteristics may be
70 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
particularly hard to scale to allow simultaneous processing of multiple daily transactions by users.
Participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem debate potential approaches to increasing the average number
of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or are
researching ways to increase scale, such as “sharding,” which is a term for a horizontal partition of data in a
database or search engine, which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single
miner’s or validator’s block.
There is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of
settlement of cryptocurrency transactions will be effective, how long they will take to become effective or
whether such mechanisms will be effective for all cryptocurrencies. There is also a risk that any mechanisms
of increasing the scale of cryptocurrency settlements may significantly alter the competitive dynamics in the
cryptocurrency market, and may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and the price of Bitdeer’s shares or the
price of BTG Ordinary Shares after the completion of the Business Combination, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.
To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the
payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not
require the payment of transaction fees. Any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss
of confidence in that cryptocurrency network, which could adversely impact an investment in Bitdeer.
To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, such transactions will not
be recorded on the blockchain. Currently, there are no known incentives for miners to elect to exclude the
recording of transactions in solved blocks; however, to the extent that any such incentives arise (e.g., a
collective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing Bitcoin users to pay transaction fees
as a substitute for or in addition to the award of new Bitcoins upon the solving of a block), actions of miners
solving a significant number of blocks could delay the recording and confirmation of transactions on the
blockchain.
Any systemic delays in the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain could result in
greater exposure to double-spending transactions and a loss of confidence in certain or all cryptocurrency
networks, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, prospects, financial condition,
and operating results.
Network congestion could result in high fees, delayed transactions, and a loss of confidence in that cryptocurrency
network, which could adversely impact an investment in Bitdeer.
Rising adoption of blockchain networks leads to network congestion, as space on decentralized ledgers
is inherently scarce. From a design standpoint, striking a balance between security, decentralization, and
scalability (or transactional throughput) is the subject of great debate among innovators and has led to the
creation of a variety of networks that make different trade-offs to achieve different outcomes. If network
congestion rises to the point where transaction fees make it prohibitively expensive for average users to
operate on the network, those users may stop using the network, and application developers may seek to
build on other networks where users can afford to transact.
Increasing growth and popularity of cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings (“ICOs”) and security token
offerings, as well as non-digital asset-related applications that utilize blockchain technology on certain
networks, can cause congestion and backlog, and as result, increase latency on such networks. An increase
in congestion and backlogs could result in longer transaction confirmation times, an increase in unconfirmed
transactions (that is, transactions that have yet to be included in a block on a network and therefore are not
yet completed transactions), higher transaction fees and an overall decrease in confidence in a particular
network, which could ultimately affect Bitdeer’s ability to transact on that particular network and, in turn,
could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer may diversify its business by mining or investing in additional cryptocurrencies which could require
significant investment or expose Bitdeer to trading risks.
The field of cryptocurrencies is constantly expanding with around 10,000 types of cryptocurrencies in
existence as of December 2021. Bitdeer intends to evaluate the potential for mining or investing in existing,
new and alternative cryptocurrencies. To the extent Bitdeer elects to commence activities to generate
71 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cryptocurrencies, Bitdeer would be required to invest Bitdeer’s assets either to obtain mining equipment
configured to generate cryptocurrencies based on a PoW protocol or to post “stakes” to generate
cryptocurrencies based on a PoS protocol. In addition, or in the alternative, Bitdeer may trade its
cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies on centralized or decentralized exchanges. Optimization of such
trades may vary depending on the exchange on which the trade is conducted because Bitdeer may not have
access to all exchanges on which such trades are available. Further, trading on centralized and decentralized
exchanges may expose Bitdeer to additional risks if such exchanges experience breaches of security
measures, system errors or vulnerabilities, software corruption, hacking or other irregularities. Any new
cryptocurrency obtained through generation or trading may be more volatile or fail to increase in value
compared to cryptocurrencies Bitdeer currently holds. As a result, any investment in different
cryptocurrencies may not achieve Bitdeer’s goals, may be viewed negatively by analysts or investors and
may negatively affect Bitdeer’s revenue and results of operations.
If the transaction fees for recording cryptocurrencies in a blockchain increase, demand for cryptocurrencies may be
reduced and prevent the expansion of the networks to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a
reduction in the acceptance or price of cryptocurrencies.
As the number of cryptocurrencies awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, the incentive
for mining participants to contribute processing power to networks will transition from a set reward to
transaction fees. In order to incentivize mining participants to continue to contribute processing power to
the networks, the network may transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a
block.
If mining participants demand higher transaction fees to record transactions in a blockchain or a
software upgrade automatically charges fees for all transactions, the cost of using cryptocurrencies may
increase and the marketplace may be reluctant to accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Existing
users may be motivated to switch from one cryptocurrency to another or back to fiat currency. Decreased
use and demand for cryptocurrencies may adversely affect their value and result in a reduction in the value
of Bitdeer’s common stock.
If the award of new cryptocurrencies and/or transaction fees for solving blocks is not sufficiently high to incentivize
miners, such processors may reduce or cease expending processing power on a particular network, which could
negatively impact the utility of the network, reduce the value of its cryptocurrencies and have a material adverse
effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
As the number of cryptocurrencies rewarded to miners for validating blocks in a network decreases, the
incentive for miners to continue contributing processing power to the network may shift toward transaction
fees. Such a shift may increase the transaction fees on a network. Higher transaction fees may reduce the
utility of a network for an end user, which may cause end users to reduce or stop their use of that network. In
such case, the price of the relevant cryptocurrency may decline substantially and could go to zero. Such
reduced price and demand for, and use of, the relevant cryptocurrency and network, either as it applies to
Bitdeer’s transaction processing services or to those of Bitdeer’s potential hosting customers, may have a
material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Miners may sell a substantial number of cryptocurrencies into the market, which may exert downward pressure on
the price of the applicable cryptocurrency and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Transaction processing requires the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of hardware,
leasing or purchasing space, involves substantial electricity costs and requires the employment of personnel
to operate the data facilities, which may lead transaction processing operators to liquidate their positions in
cryptocurrencies to fund these capital requirements. In addition, if the reward of new cryptocurrencies for
transaction processing declines, and/or if transaction fees are not sufficiently high, profit margins for
transaction processing operators may be reduced, and such operators may be more likely to sell a higher
percentage of their cryptocurrencies. Whereas it is believed that individual operators in past years were more
likely to hold cryptocurrencies for more extended periods, the immediate selling of newly transacted
cryptocurrencies by operators may increase the supply of such cryptocurrencies on the applicable exchange
72 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
market, which could create downward pressure on the price of the cryptocurrencies and, in turn, could have
a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
To the extent that the profit margins of cryptocurrency mining operations are not high, mining participants are more
likely to sell their earned Bitcoin, which could constrain Bitcoin prices.
Over the past few years, cryptocurrency mining operations have evolved from individual users mining
with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation application-specific integrated
circuit (“ASIC”) servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and
unincorporated “professionalized” mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use
proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They require the
investment of significant capital to acquire this hardware, to lease operating space (often in datacenters or
warehousing facilities), and to pay the costs of electricity and labor to operate the mining datacenters. As a
result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior mining operations and have more
defined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized
mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of cryptocurrencies. To the extent the price of
cryptocurrencies declines and such profit margin is constrained, professionalized mining participants are
incentivized to more immediately sell cryptocurrencies earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed
that individual mining participants in past years were more likely to hold newly mined cryptocurrencies for
more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined cryptocurrencies greatly increases the trading
volume of the cryptocurrencies, creating downward pressure on the market price of cryptocurrency rewards.
The extent to which the value of cryptocurrencies mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the
allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized
mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined cryptocurrencies rapidly if
it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is
negative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby
potentially depressing cryptocurrency prices. Lower cryptocurrency prices could result in further tightening
of profit margins for professionalized mining operations creating a network effect that may further reduce the
price of cryptocurrencies until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable forcing
them to reduce mining power or cease mining operations temporarily. Such circumstances could have a
material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of Bitcoin
and any other cryptocurrencies Bitdeer mines or otherwise acquire or hold for Bitdeer’s own account.
Cryptocurrencies and transactions may be subject to further taxation in the future.
In recent years, the rise of cryptocurrency prices and transaction volume has attracted the attention of
tax authorities. As the laws governing cryptocurrencies are still evolving, the tax treatment of
cryptocurrencies in various jurisdictions is subject to change. New laws or legislations, such as the ones
introduced in the United States under the “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” commonly referred to as
the “infrastructure bill,” which was signed into law on November 15, 2021, will include tax reporting
provisions that apply to cryptocurrencies. Introductions of more stringent provisions on reporting or
surveillance of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrencies will likely be an ongoing trend from authorities
worldwide. Bitdeer cautions that these new provisions may direct or indirectly impact scrutiny and
assessments in relation to taxation. While some countries have expressed an intention to or have imposed
taxation on cryptocurrencies and transactions, other tax authorities have been silent. As there is
considerable uncertainty over the taxation of cryptocurrencies, there is no guarantee that the
cryptocurrencies and transactions denominated in cryptocurrencies will not be subject to further taxation in
the future, including but not limited to additional taxes and increased tax rate. These events could reduce the
economic return of cryptocurrency and increase the holding costs of cryptocurrencies, rendering the
cryptocurrency mining solutions Bitdeer provides less attractive to customers, which could materially and
adversely affect Bitdeer’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Other Legal Matters
Bitdeer is subject to a highly-evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or its failure to comply
with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect its business, reputation, prospects or operations.
Until recently, relatively little regulatory attention has been directed toward the crypto assets market by
U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments and self-regulatory agencies. As crypto assets
have
73 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
grown in popularity and in market size, the U.S. regulatory regime - namely the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.
Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the SEC, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the
“CFTC”), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (the “FinCEN”) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation), and local and foreign governmental organizations, consumer agencies and public advocacy
groups have been examining the operations of crypto networks, users and platforms, with a focus on how
crypto assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities, fund criminal or terrorist enterprises,
and the safety and soundness of platforms and other service providers that hold crypto assets for users.
Many of these entities have called for heightened regulatory oversight, and have issued consumer
advisories describing the risks posed by crypto assets to users and investors. For instance, in March 2022,
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed the need for regulation to prevent “cryptocurrencies from
serving as a vehicle for terrorist finance and just general criminal behavior”. On March 8, 2022, President
Biden announced an executive order on cryptocurrencies which seeks to establish a unified federal
regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies. The complexity and evolving nature of Bitdeer’s business and the
significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the crypto assets industry requires Bitdeer to exercise
its judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to it, and it is possible that
governmental bodies and regulators may disagree with its conclusions. To the extent Bitdeer has not
complied with such laws, rules and regulations, Bitdeer could be subject to significant fines, revocation of
licenses, limitations on its products and services, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences,
each of which may be significant and could adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial
condition.
Additionally, the recent bankruptcy filings of FTX, the third largest digital asset exchange by volume at
the time of its filing, and its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC, in addition to other bankruptcy
filings of crypto companies throughout calendar year 2022, will likely attract heightened regulatory scrutiny
from U.S. regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC. Increasing regulation and regulatory scrutiny may
result in additional costs for Bitdeer and Bitdeer’s management having to devote increased time and
attention to regulatory matters, change aspects of Bitdeer’s business or result in limits on the utility of
Bitcoin. In addition, regulatory developments and/or Bitdeer’s business activities may require Bitdeer to
comply with certain regulatory regimes. Increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements and any
regulatory investigations and enforcement may result in changes to Bitdeer’s business, as well as increased
costs, supervision and examination. Moreover, new laws, regulations, or interpretations may result in
additional litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement or other actions. Adverse changes to, or
Bitdeer’s failure to comply with, any laws and regulations may have, an adverse effect on Bitdeer’s
reputation and brand and its business, operating results, and financial condition.
Although Bitdeer is not directly connected to the recent cryptocurrency market events, Bitdeer may still
suffer reputational harm due to its association with the cryptocurrency industry in light of the recent
disruption in the crypto asset markets. Ongoing and future regulation and regulatory actions could
significantly restrict or eliminate the market for or uses of Bitcoin and/or may adversely affect Bitdeer’s
business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
The nature of Bitdeer’s business requires the application of complex financial accounting rules, and there is limited
guidance from accounting standard setting bodies. If financial accounting standards undergo significant changes,
Bitdeer’s operating results could be adversely affected.
The accounting rules and regulations that Bitdeer must comply with are complex and subject to
interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”), the SEC, and various bodies
formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or
interpretations could have a significant effect on Bitdeer’s reported financial results, and may even affect the
reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Recent actions
and public comments from the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting and internal controls.
In addition, many companies’ accounting policies are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and
the public. Further, there has been limited precedents for the financial accounting of cryptocurrency-related
transactions. As such, there remains significant uncertainty on how companies can account for crypto
assets transactions, crypto assets, and related revenue. Uncertainties in or changes to regulatory or financial
accounting standards could result in the need to change Bitdeer’s accounting methods and restate its
financial statements and impair its ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could
adversely
74 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
affect the accuracy of its financial statements, result in a loss of investor confidence, and more generally
impact its business, operating result, and financial condition.
Bitdeer is subject to tax risks related to Bitdeer’s multinational operations.
Bitdeer is subject to taxes in various overseas jurisdictions where Bitdeer operates. Tax laws and
practices applicable in the various jurisdictions Bitdeer operates in are complex and sophisticated, and
Bitdeer faces risks of tax incompliance caused by misunderstanding of regional tax policies or different tax
administration enforcement. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may
be subject to significant changes. Bitdeer’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of
earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and
liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
Bitdeer is also subject to the examination of tax returns and other tax matters by domestic and
international tax authorities and governmental bodies. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these
examinations. If Bitdeer’s effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of Bitdeer’s
taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, Bitdeer’s financial condition,
operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Bitdeer’s interactions with a blockchain may expose it to SDN or blocked persons or cause Bitdeer to violate
provisions of law that did not contemplate distribute ledger technology.
The OFAC requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons
named on its specially designated nationals (“SDN”) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of
blockchain transactions, Bitdeer may, inadvertently and without its knowledge, engage in transactions with
persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Bitdeer’s internal policies prohibit any transactions with such SDN
individuals, but it may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with
whom it transacts with respect to Bitdeer cryptocurrency mining-related products and services. In addition,
in the future, OFAC or another regulator, may require Bitdeer to screen transactions for OFAC addresses or
other bad actors before including such transactions in a block, which may increase Bitdeer’s compliance
costs, decrease Bitdeer’s anticipated transaction fees and lead to decreased traffic on Bitdeer’s network. Any
of these factors, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, prospects,
financial condition, and operating results.
Moreover, federal law prohibits any U.S. person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual
depiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have
embedded such depictions on one or more blockchains. Because Bitdeer’s business requires it to download
and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate Bitdeer’s ongoing business, it is possible that such digital
ledgers contain prohibited depictions without Bitdeer’s knowledge or consent. To the extent government
enforcement authorities literally enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by
decentralized distributed ledger technology, Bitdeer may be subject to investigation, administrative or court
proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm Bitdeer’s reputation
and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, prospects, financial condition, and operating
results.
Bitdeer’s mining datacenters may be located on property whose owner has not obtained the approval of relevant
authorities, and it may be ordered to relocate from that property.
Bitdeer’s mining datacenters where mining machines operate are located in different places around the
world. Due to the unexpectable regulations that the governments may impose on the development of
cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency mining, the properties Bitdeer is renting currently may not be in
accordance with local zoning ordinance. Such mining datacenters may be considered to be in violation of
relevant zoning laws and the government may order the demolition or relocation of such datacenters. If
Bitdeer is evicted from such property, it may need to find alternative properties and relocate Bitdeer’s mining
datacenters. Unless Bitdeer is able to make timely alternative arrangements for relocating, it may not be able
to fulfill purchase orders received, which may have a material and adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business,
results of operations and financial condition.
75 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Bitdeer may be involved in legal and other disputes from time to time arising out of Bitdeer’s operations, including
disputes with Bitdeer’s suppliers, business partners, customers or employees.
Bitdeer may from time to time be involved in disputes with various parties arising out of Bitdeer’s
operations, including mining machines or electricity suppliers, business partners, customers or employees.
These disputes may lead to protests or legal or other proceedings and may result in damage to Bitdeer’s
reputation, substantial costs and diversion of resources and management’s attention from Bitdeer’s core
business activities. In addition, Bitdeer may encounter compliance issues with regulatory bodies in the
course of Bitdeer’s operations, in respect of which Bitdeer may face administrative proceedings or
unfavorable rulings that may result in liabilities and cause delays or disruptions to Bitdeer’s services. Bitdeer
may be involved in other proceedings or disputes in the future that may have a material adverse effect on
Bitdeer’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Bitdeer may increasingly become a target for public scrutiny, including complaints to regulatory agencies, negative
media coverage, and malicious allegations, all of which could severely damage Bitdeer’s reputation and materially
and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business and prospects.
Certain features of cryptocurrency networks, such as decentralization, independence from sovereignty
and anonymity of transactions, create the possibility of heightened attention from the public, regulators and
the media. Heightened regulatory and public concerns over cryptocurrency-related issues may subject
Bitdeer to additional legal and social responsibilities and increased scrutiny and negative publicity over
these issues and even boycott by the rest of the mining community, due to Bitdeer’s leading position in the
cryptocurrency mining industry. From time to time, these allegations, regardless of their veracity, may result
in consumer dissatisfaction, public protests or negative publicity, which could result in government inquiry
or substantial harm to Bitdeer’s brand, reputation and operations. Moreover, as Bitdeer’s business expands
and grows, Bitdeer may be exposed to heightened public scrutiny in jurisdictions where Bitdeer already
operates as well as in new jurisdictions where Bitdeer may operate. There is no assurance that Bitdeer would
not become a target for regulatory or public scrutiny in the future or that scrutiny and public exposure would
not severely damage Bitdeer’s reputation as well as Bitdeer’s business and prospects.
Bitdeer’s insurance coverage is limited and may not be adequate to cover potential losses and liabilities. A
significant uninsured loss or a loss in excess of Bitdeer’s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on
Bitdeer’s results of operations and financial condition.
Risks associated with Bitdeer’s business and operations include, but are not limited to, business
interruption due to regulatory changes, power shortages or network failure, product liability claims and
losses of key personnel, any of which may result in significant costs or business disruption. In line with
general market practice, Bitdeer does not have any business liability or disruption insurance to cover
Bitdeer’s operations. However, Bitdeer’s current insurance policies may be insufficient in the event of a
prolonged or catastrophic event. The occurrence of any such event that is not entirely covered by Bitdeer’s
insurance policies may result in interruption of Bitdeer’s operations, subject Bitdeer to significant losses or
liabilities and damage Bitdeer’s reputation as a provider of business continuity services. In addition, the
property, transit and director and officer insurance policies Bitdeer has obtained may not cover all risks
associated with Bitdeer’s business. It may not be possible, either because of a lack of available policies,
limits on coverage or prohibitive cost, for Bitdeer to obtain insurance of any type that would cover losses
associated with Bitdeer’s cryptocurrency portfolio. The occurrence of certain incidents including severe
weather, earthquake, fire, war, power outages, flooding and the consequences resulting from them may not
be covered by Bitdeer’s insurance policies adequately, or at all. If Bitdeer were subject to substantial
liabilities that were not covered by its insurance, Bitdeer could incur costs and losses that could materially
and adversely affect Bitdeer’s results of operations and financial condition.
The cryptocurrencies held by Bitdeer are not insured. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to
Bitdeer’s cryptocurrencies which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages
which could adversely affect Bitdeer’s operations and, consequently, an investment in Bitdeer.
Bitcoin mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of mining machines and
have a negative environmental impact.
Bitcoin mining activities are inherently energy-intensive and electricity costs account for a significant
portion of the overall mining costs. The availability and cost of electricity will restrict the geographic
locations
76 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of mining activities. Any shortage of electricity supply or increase in electricity cost in a jurisdiction may
negatively impact the viability and the expected economic return for Bitcoin mining activities in that
jurisdiction, which may in turn decrease the sales of Bitdeer’s Bitcoin mining machines in that jurisdiction.
In addition, the significant consumption of electricity may have a negative environmental impact,
including contribution to climate change, which may give rise to public opinion against allowing the use of
electricity for Bitcoin mining activities or government measures restricting or prohibiting the use of
electricity for Bitcoin mining activities. Any such development in the jurisdictions where Bitdeer sells its
cryptocurrency mining-related products and services could have a material and adverse effect on Bitdeer’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer’s business operation and international expansion are subject to geopolitical risks.
Bitdeer’s business operation and international expansion are subject to geopolitical risks. Any
significant deterioration in Bitdeer’s business collaboration with Bitdeer’s partners may have a negative
impact on the ability of Bitdeer’s business partners to produce or deliver the equipment or components
Bitdeer needs, which could have a material and adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.
In addition, there might be significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs,
including trade policies and tariffs regarding the Europe Union or other major economy entities. Countries
may respond by imposing retaliatory trade measures against the United States. For details about
international trade relations, see the section entitled “- Risks Related to Bitdeer’s Business, Operations,
Industry and Financial Condition - Changes in international trade policies and international barriers to trade
may have an adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business and expansion plans” in this section. Variations in the
trade policies among different countries will significantly influence Bitdeer’s worldwide business and
regional business relationship, which will materially and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer’s business operation and international expansion may have an intrinsic need for governmental interactions,
and are therefore subject to higher corruption risks.
Bitdeer requires significant power resources and related infrastructures to support cryptocurrency
mining, and that Bitdeer’s business operates under a fast-changing regulatory landscape, both in terms of
cryptocurrency and environmental regulations. Such business nature may pose an intrinsic need for Bitdeer
to frequently interact with government authorities by, for example, accessing natural resources and engaging
in lobbying activities with respect to any relevant regulatory changes. Frequent governmental interactions
may pose higher corruption and bribery risks to Bitdeer. In addition, Bitdeer’s plan to expand internationally,
including into jurisdictions which are considered high-risk from an anti-bribery and anti-corruption
perspective, also heightens the corruption risks for Bitdeer.
Bitdeer requires certain approvals, licenses, permits and certifications to operate. Any failure to obtain or renew any
of these approvals, licenses, permits or certifications could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business and
results of operations.
In accordance with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Bitdeer operates, Bitdeer is
required to maintain certain approvals, licenses, permits and certifications, such as obtaining certificates of
occupancy and passing electrical inspection for Bitdeer’s mining datacenters. Complying with such laws and
regulations may require substantial expense, and any non-compliance may expose Bitdeer to liability. In the
event of non-compliance, Bitdeer may have to incur significant expenses and divert substantial management
time to rectify the incidents. In the future, if Bitdeer fails to obtain all the necessary approvals, licenses,
permits and certifications, it may be subject to fines or the suspension of operations of the production
facilities and research and development facilities that do not have all the requisite approvals, licenses,
permits and certifications, which could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business and results of
operations. Bitdeer may also experience adverse publicity arising from non-compliance with government
regulations, which would negatively impact Bitdeer’s reputation.
There is no assurance that Bitdeer will be able to fulfill all the conditions necessary to obtain the
required government approvals, or that relevant government officials will always, if ever, exercise their
discretion in
77 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Bitdeer’s favor, or that Bitdeer will be able to adapt to any new laws, regulations and policies. There may also
be delays on the part of government authorities in reviewing Bitdeer’s applications and granting approvals,
whether due to the lack of human resources or the imposition of new rules, regulations, government policies
or their implementation, interpretation and enforcement. If Bitdeer is unable to obtain, or experiences material
delays in obtaining, necessary government approvals, Bitdeer’s operations may be substantially disrupted,
which could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer is not aware of any governmental licenses or authorizations required to offer its products and
services to customers in the jurisdictions it offers such products and services. However, Bitdeer’s hash rate
sharing business may be subject to U.S. jurisdictions under certain circumstances. See the section entitled “-
Bitdeer’s hash rate sharing business may be subject to U.S. jurisdiction if Bitdeer is not able to avoid
offering or selling its hash rate products to U.S. customers. Additionally, Bitdeer’s hash rate sharing
business may be deemed as securities offerings in other jurisdictions where it is offered.”
Bitdeer may be subject to fines and other administrative penalties resulting from the operation of Bitdeer’s business,
which could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operation.
Bitdeer is a leading cryptocurrency mining service provider with a strong global presence. As of June
30, 2022, it operates five prime mining datacenters in the United States and Norway and served users across
over 100 countries and regions around the globe, and may continue to expand Bitdeer’s operations to more
countries and regions. Bitdeer is subject to regulation by the multiple government authorities in countries or
regions where it has presence, and various jurisdictions may from time to time adopt laws, regulations or
directives that affect Bitdeer’s businesses. Moreover, the relevant regulatory authorities possess significant
powers to enforce applicable regulatory requirements in the event of Bitdeer’s non-compliance, including the
imposition of fines, sanctions or the revocation of licenses or permits to operate Bitdeer’s business. Bitdeer
is subject to regulatory risks with regards to mining, holding, using, or transferring cryptocurrencies, etc.,
and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment and Bitdeer’s ability to anticipate and respond to potential
changes in government policies and regulations will have a significant impact on Bitdeer’s business
operations in countries it operates in and Bitdeer’s overall results of operations. Regulations have impacted
or could impact, among others, the nature of and scope of offerings Bitdeer is able to make available, the
pricing of offerings on Bitdeer’s platform, Bitdeer’s relationship with, and incentives, fees and commissions
provided to or charged from Bitdeer’s business partners, Bitdeer’s ability to operate in certain segments of
Bitdeer’s business. Bitdeer expects that its ability to manage its relationships with regulators in each of its
markets, as well as existing and evolving regulations will continue to impact its results in the future. Any
misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the law and regulation could subject Bitdeer to, among others, the
non-compliance investigation by the government authorities. There is no guarantee that Bitdeer will not face
administrative fines or penalties concerning its operations or its subsidiaries, which could have a material
adverse impact on its results of operation.
If counterfeit products and services are provided under Bitdeer’s brand names and trademarks, Bitdeer’s reputation
and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.
Third-party service providers and dealers are separately responsible for sourcing counterfeit services
that are performed under Bitdeer’s brand names and trademarks. Counterfeit services may be dissatisfying or
inferior in quality as compared to authentic services. If Bitdeer’s customers are not satisfied by counterfeit
services provided under Bitdeer’s brand names and trademarks, Bitdeer may be subject to reputational
damage. Bitdeer believes its brand and reputation are important to its success and competitive position. The
discovery of counterfeit services provided under Bitdeer’s brand names and trademarks may severally
damage Bitdeer’s reputation and cause customers to refrain from making future purchases from it, which
would materially and adversely affect Bitdeer’s business operations and financial results.
Bitdeer’s hash rate sharing business may be subject to U.S. jurisdiction if Bitdeer is not able to avoid offering or
selling its hash rate products to U.S. customers. Additionally, Bitdeer’s hash rate sharing business may be deemed as
securities offerings in other jurisdictions where it is offered.
To the extent that Bitdeer is appropriately restricting U.S. persons from obtaining its hash rate products,
such business should not be subject to U.S. securities laws. However, whether Bitdeer is effective in
avoiding
78 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
U.S. jurisdiction by actually not offering or selling its hash rate products to U.S. customers would depend
on, among others, the existence and effectiveness of measures adopted in practice against U.S. persons
obtaining Bitdeer’s services, such as screening mechanisms and/or contractual restrictions over transfers of
the contracts to U.S. persons in the secondary market. See the section entitled “Information Related to
Bitdeer - Our Business Lines and Software Infrastructure - Measures to prevent unauthorized or
impermissible customer access” for more details. If certain U.S. customers, or customers from other
jurisdictions where Bitdeer’s hash rate sharing may be deemed as securities offerings, end up obtaining
access to Bitdeer’s hash rate products, and Bitdeer has not registered the offering of such products, Bitdeer
may be deemed in breach of applicable securities laws. Such breach may result in sizable fines, reputational
harms, restrictions of certain businesses, and materially adversely affect Bitdeer’s business operation and
financial conditions.
If Bitdeer were deemed an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
applicable restrictions could make it impractical for Bitdeer to continue its business as contemplated and could
have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business.
An issuer will generally be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act if:
it is an “orthodox” investment company because it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or
proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or
it is an inadvertent investment company because, absent an applicable exemption, it owns or
proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total
assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.
Bitdeer believes it is not and will not be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or
trading in securities, and Bitdeer does not hold itself out as being engaged in those activities. Bitdeer
intends to hold itself out as a cryptocurrency mining business. Accordingly, Bitdeer does not believe that it
is an “orthodox” investment company as described in the first bullet point above.
While certain cryptocurrencies may be deemed to be securities, Bitdeer does not believe that certain
other cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoin, are securities; therefore, it believes that less than 40% of
Bitdeer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis
will comprise cryptocurrencies that could be considered investment securities. Accordingly, Bitdeer does not
believe that Bitdeer is an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% inadvertent investment
company test as described in the second bullet point above. Although Bitdeer does not believe any of the
cryptocurrencies it may own, acquire or mine are securities, there is still some regulatory uncertainty on the
subject, see “- There is no one unifying principle governing the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies nor
whether cryptocurrencies are securities in any particular context. Regulatory changes or actions in one or
more countries may alter the nature of an investment in Bitdeer or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, such
as cryptocurrencies, in a manner that adversely affects Bitdeer’s business, prospects or operations.” If
certain cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, were to be deemed securities, and consequently, investment
securities by the SEC, Bitdeer could be deemed an inadvertent investment company. Investment company
registration is time consuming and would require a restructuring of Bitdeer’s business. Moreover, the
operation of an investment company is very costly and restrictive, as investment companies are subject to
substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio
composition, and the Investment Company Act filing requirements. The cost of such compliance would
result in Bitdeer incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a
materially adverse impact on its operations.
Bitdeer intends to conduct its operations so that Bitdeer is not required to register as an investment
company under the 1940 Act. Specifically, Bitdeer does not believe that cryptocurrencies, in particular
Bitcoin, are securities. The SEC Staff has not provided guidance with respect to the treatment of these assets
under the 1940 Act. To the extent the SEC Staff publishes new guidance with respect to these matters,
Bitdeer may be required to adjust its strategy or assets accordingly. There can be no assurance that Bitdeer
will be able to maintain its exclusion from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. In
addition, as a consequence of its seeking to avoid the need to register under the 1940 Act on an ongoing
basis, Bitdeer may be limited in its ability to engage in cryptocurrency mining operations or otherwise make
certain investments, and these limitations could result in Bitdeer holding assets it may wish to sell or selling
assets it may wish to hold, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and
results of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If Bitdeer were to be deemed an inadvertent investment company, it may seek to rely on Rule 3a-2 under
the 1940 Act, which allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of
(a) the date on which the issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer’s
total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis or (b) the date on which the issuer owns or
proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total
assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Bitdeer is
putting in place policies that it expects will work to keep the investment securities held by Bitdeer at less
than 40% of its total assets, which may include acquiring assets with Bitdeer’s cash, liquidating Bitdeer’s
investment securities or seeking no-action relief or exemptive relief from the SEC if Bitdeer is unable to
acquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner. As Rule 3a-2 is
available to an issuer no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available
to Bitdeer, it would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after it ceases being an
inadvertent investment company. This may limit Bitdeer’s ability to make certain investments or enter into
joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on Bitdeer’s earnings. If Bitdeer failed to take
adequate steps within the one-year grace period for inadvertent investment companies, it would need to
register with the SEC as an investment company under the Investment Company Act or cease almost all
business, and its contracts would become voidable. In any event, Bitdeer does not intend to become an
investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.
Finally, Bitdeer believes it is not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the 1940 Act because
Bitdeer is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.
The 1940 Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operations
of investment companies. Among other things, the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit
transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the
issuance of stock options, and impose certain governance requirements. Bitdeer intends to continue to
conduct its operations so that it will not be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act.
However, if anything were to happen that would cause Bitdeer to be deemed to be an investment company
under the 1940 Act, requirements imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on Bitdeer’s capital
structure, ability to transact business with affiliates and ability to compensate key employees, could make it
impractical for Bitdeer to continue its business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and
arrangements between and among Bitdeer and its senior management team and materially and adversely
affect Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
There is no one unifying principle governing the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies nor whether cryptocurrencies
are securities in any particular context. Regulatory changes or actions in one or more countries may alter the nature
of an investment in Bitdeer or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoins, in a manner that adversely
affects Bitdeer’s business, prospects or operations.
As cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world
have reacted differently, with certain governments deeming cryptocurrencies illegal, and others allowing
their use and trade without restriction. In some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., cryptocurrencies, such as
Bitcoins, are subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory
requirements.
Bitcoin is the oldest and most well-known form of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and other forms of
cryptocurrencies have been the source of much regulatory consternation, resulting in differing definitional
outcomes without a single unifying statement. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are viewed differently by
different regulatory and standards setting organizations globally as well as in the United States on the
federal and state levels. For example, the Financial Action Task Force considers a cryptocurrency as
currency or an asset, and the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) considers a cryptocurrency as property and
not currency. Further, the IRS applies general tax principles that apply to property transactions to
transactions involving virtual currency.
Furthermore, in the several applications to establish an exchange traded fund (“ETF”) of
cryptocurrency, and in the questions raised by the Staff under the 1940 Act, no clear principles emerge from
the regulators as to how they view these issues and how to regulate cryptocurrency under the applicable
securities acts. It has been widely reported that the SEC has recently issued letters and requested various
ETF applications be withdrawn because of concerns over liquidity and valuation and unanswered questions
about absence of
80 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reporting and compliance procedures capable of being implemented under the current state of the markets for
exchange traded funds. On April 20, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill titled
“Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021”  (H.R. 1602). If passed by the Senate and enacted into law, the
bipartisan bill would create a cryptocurrency working group to evaluate the current legal and regulatory
framework around cryptocurrencies in the United States and define when the SEC may have jurisdiction over
a particular token or cryptocurrency (i.e., when it is a security) and when the CFTC may have jurisdiction
(i.e., on derivatives of a cryptocurrency when it is a commodity).
If regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies under
the securities laws of the United States or elsewhere, including the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
1940 Act, and the Bank Secrecy Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions and interpretations by the SEC, the
CFTC, the IRS, Department of Treasury or other agencies or authorities, Bitdeer may be required to register
and comply with such regulations, including at a state or local level. To the extent that Bitdeer decides to
continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary
expense or burdens to Bitdeer. Bitdeer may also decide to cease certain operations and change Bitdeer’s
business model. Any disruption of Bitdeer’s operations in response to the changed regulatory
circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to it.
A determination that any cryptocurrency is a “security” may adversely affect the value of such cryptocurrency and
could therefore adversely affect Bitdeer's business, prospects or operations.
Depending on its characteristics, a cryptocurrency may be considered a “security” under the federal
securities laws. The test for determining whether a particular cryptocurrency is a “security” is complex and
difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Whether a crytocurrency is a security under the
federal securities laws depends on whether it is included in the lists of instruments making up the definition
of “security” in the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. Cryptocurrencies as
such do not appear in any of these lists, although each list includes the terms “investment contract” and
“note,” and the SEC has typically analyzed whether a particular cryptocurrency is a security by reference to
whether it meets the tests developed by the federal courts interpreting these terms, known as the Howey and
Reves tests, respectively. For many cryptocurrencies, whether or not the Howey or Reves tests are met is
difficult to resolve definitively, and substantial legal arguments can often be made both in favor of and
against a particular digital asset qualifying as a security under one or both of the Howey and Reves tests.
Adding to the complexity, the SEC staff has indicated that the security status of a particular digital asset can
change over time as the relevant facts evolve.
Current and future legislation and SEC-rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including
interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which Bitcoin or other
cryptocurrencies are viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies may not be excluded from the definition of “security” by SEC rulemaking or
interpretation requiring registration of all transactions unless another exemption is available, including
transacting in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies among owners and requiring registration of trading platforms
as “exchanges.” Accordingly, cryptocurrencies such as Zcash may currently be a security, based on the
facts as they exist today, or may in the future be found by the SEC or a federal court to be a security under
the federal securities laws. Historically, Bitdeer has generated minimum amount of mining yields from Zcash
and held minimum amount of Zcash. See the section entitled “Information Related to Bitdeer - Our
Cryptocurrencies” for more details. Bitdeer does not intend to hold or generate mining yield from
cryptocurrencies in violation of the federal securities laws. Accordingly, if Zcash or other cryptocurrencies
involved in Bitdeer’s business is determined by Bitdeer, the SEC or other regulatory authorities to be a
security under the federal securities laws, it could result in interruption of Bitdeer’s business operations.
Furthermore, the SEC may determine that certain cryptocurrencies or interests, for example tokens
offered and sold in ICOs, may constitute securities under the Howey test as stated by the United States
Supreme Court. As such, ICO offerings would require registration under the Securities Act or an available
exemption therefrom for offers or sales in the United States to be lawful. Section 5(a) of the Securities Act
provides that, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it is unlawful for any person,
directly or indirectly, to engage in the offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. Section 5(c) of the
Securities Act provides a similar prohibition against offers to sell, or offers to buy, unless a registration
statement has been filed.
81 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Although Bitdeer does not intend to be engaged in the offer or sale of securities in the form of ICO offerings,
and Bitdeer does not believe its planned mining activities would require registration for it to conduct such
activities and accumulate cryptocurrencies, the SEC, CFTC, Nasdaq, IRS or other governmental or quasi-
governmental agency or organization may conclude that Bitdeer’s activities involve the offer or sale of
“securities,” or ownership of “investment securities,” and it may be subject to regulation or registration
requirements under various federal laws and related rules. Such regulation or the inability to meet the
requirements to continue operations, would have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business and
operations. Bitdeer may also face similar issues with various state securities regulators who may interpret
Bitdeer’s actions as subjecting it to regulation, or requiring registration, under state securities laws, banking
laws, or money transmitter and similar laws, which are also an unsettled area or regulation that exposes
Bitdeer to risks.
Regulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of cryptocurrencies or the operation of cryptocurrency networks
in a manner that may require Bitdeer to cease certain or all operations, which could have a material adverse effect
on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Recently, there has been a significant amount of regulatory attention directed toward cryptocurrencies,
cryptocurrency networks and other industry participants by United States federal and state governments,
foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. For example, as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have
grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies
(e.g., FinCEN, the SEC, the CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the
operations of the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin users and Bitcoin exchange markets.
In addition, local state regulators such as the Texas State Securities Board, the Massachusetts
Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities,
the North Carolina Secretary of State’s Securities Division and the Vermont Department of Financial
Regulation have initiated actions against, and investigations of, individuals and companies involved in
cryptocurrencies.
Also, in March 2018, the South Carolina Attorney General Office’s Security Division issued a cease-and-
desist order against Genesis Mining and Swiss Gold Global, Inc., stating that both companies were to stop
doing business in South Carolina and are permanently barred from offering securities in the state in the
future since they offered unregistered securities via cloud mining contracts under the South Carolina
Uniformed Securities Act of 2005, S.C. Code Ann. § 35-1-101, et seq. (the order against Genesis Mining was
subsequently withdrawn). Neither Bitdeer nor, to Bitdeer’s knowledge, Matrixport Group, has any direct or
indirect relationship with these two companies.
Further, the North Carolina Secretary of State’s Securities Division issued in March 2018 a Temporary
Cease and Desist Order against Power Mining Pool (made permanent pursuant to a Final Order on April 19,
2018), ordering it to cease and desist, among other things, offering “mining pool shares,” which were deemed
“securities” under N.C. Gen. Stat. 78A-2(11), in North Carolina until they are registered with the North
Carolina Secretary of State or are offered for sale pursuant to an exemption from registration under the North
Carolina Securities Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. Chapter 78A.
Additionally, Bitdeer relies on third-party mining pool service providers for mining revenue payouts
from Bitdeer’s mining operation, and certain of Bitdeer’s potential hosting customers could be involved in, or
could issue, cloud mining contracts or mining pool shares, and any regulatory restrictions on their practices
could significantly reduce demand for Bitdeer’s hosting services. Furthermore, it is possible that laws,
regulations or directives that affect cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency transaction processing or blockchain
server hosting may change in a manner that may adversely affect Bitdeer’s ability to conduct Bitdeer’s
business and operations in the relevant jurisdiction.
In addition, various foreign jurisdictions either have adopted or may adopt laws, regulations or
directives that affect cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency networks and their users and hosting service
providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope. Such laws, regulations or directives may
conflict with those of the United States, may negatively impact the acceptance of cryptocurrencies by users,
merchants and service providers outside of the United States and may therefore impede the growth of
cryptocurrency use. A number of countries, including India, South Korea and Russia, among others,
currently have a more restrictive stance toward cryptocurrencies and, thereby, have reduced the rate of
expansion of cryptocurrency use, as well as cryptocurrency transaction processing, in each of those
countries.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Governments may in the future take regulatory actions that prohibit or severely restrict the right to
acquire, own, hold, sell, use or trade cryptocurrencies or to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currency.
Ownership of, holding or trading in cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction.
Governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost and/or subject cryptocurrency
mining companies to additional regulation.
By extension, similar actions by governments may result in the restriction of the acquisition, ownership,
holding, selling, use or trading in the capital stock of cryptocurrency mining companies, including Bitdeer’s
common stock. Such a restriction could result in Bitdeer liquidating its cryptocurrency inventory at
unfavorable prices and may adversely affect Bitdeer’s shareholders. The effect of any regulatory change,
either by federal, state, local or foreign governments or any self-regulatory agencies, on Bitdeer or its
potential hosting customers is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and may require
Bitdeer or its potential hosting customers to cease certain or all operations and could have a material adverse
effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Current and future legislation and rulemaking regarding cryptocurrencies may result in extraordinary, non-
recurring expenses and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Current and future legislation and rulemaking by the CFTC and SEC or other regulators, including
interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which cryptocurrencies are
treated. For example, cryptocurrencies derivatives are not excluded from the definition of “commodity future”
by the CFTC. Furthermore, according to the CFTC, cryptocurrencies fall within the definition of a commodity
under the Commodities Exchange Act (the “CEA”) and as a result, Bitdeer may be required to register and
comply with additional regulations under the CEA, including additional periodic reporting and disclosure
standards and requirements. Bitdeer may also be required to register as a commodity pool operator and to
register as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. If Bitdeer is required
to register with the CFTC or another governmental or self-regulatory authority, the scope of Bitdeer’s
business and operations may be constrained by the rules of such authority and it may be forced to incur
additional expenses in the form of licensing fees, professional fees and other costs of compliance.
The SEC has issued guidance and made numerous statements regarding the application of securities
laws to cryptocurrencies. For example, on July 25, 2017, the SEC issued a Report of Investigation (the
“Report”) which concluded that tokens offered and sold by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization
(“DAO”), a digital decentralized autonomous organization and investor-directed venture capital fund for
cryptocurrencies, were issued for the purpose of raising funds. The Report concluded that these tokens were
“investment contracts” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the
Exchange Act, and therefore securities subject to the federal securities laws. In December 2017, the SEC
issued a cease-and-desist letter to Munchee Inc., ordering that the company stop its initial coin offering of
MUN Tokens on the grounds that it failed to file a registration statement or qualify for an exemption from
registration. Similar to the tokens issued by the DAO, the SEC found that the MUN Tokens satisfied the
definition of an “investment contract,” and were therefore subject to the federal securities laws. In February
2018, both the SEC and CFTC further reiterated their concerns regarding cryptocurrencies in written
testimony to the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. On March 7, 2018, the SEC released
a “Statement on Potentially Unlawful Online Platforms for Trading Digital Assets,” and reiterated that, if a
platform “offers trading of cryptocurrencies that are securities” and “operates as ‘exchange,’ as defined by
the federal securities laws,” the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be
exempt from registration. The SEC’s statement serves as a notice to operators of any platforms, including
secondary market trading platforms, which the SEC is actively monitoring for potentially fraudulent or
manipulative behavior in the market for security tokens, as the SEC has cautioned recently in the context of
ICOs. On November 16, 2018, the SEC released a “Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and
Trading,” and emphasized that market participants must adhere to the SEC’s well-established and well-
functioning federal securities law framework when dealing with technological innovations, regardless of
whether the securities are issued in certificated form or using new technologies, such as blockchain. This
has all been followed by additional statements and guidance from the SEC including no-action letters relating
to specific blockchain-based projects, and a Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets
published by the Division of Corporation Finance on April 3, 2019. In an August 2021 interview, SEC
Chairman Gensler signaled the SEC is
83 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
contemplating a robust regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies and reiterated the SEC’s position that many
cryptocurrencies are unregulated securities.
The SEC has been active in asserting its jurisdiction over ICOs and cryptocurrencies and in bringing
enforcement cases. The SEC has directed enforcement activity toward cryptocurrencies, and more
enforcement cases. The SEC has directed enforcement activity toward cryptocurrencies, and more
specifically, ICOs. In September 2017, the SEC created a new division known as the “Cyber Unit” to address,
among other things, violations involving distributed ledger technology and ICOs, and filed a civil complaint
in the Eastern District of New York charging a businessman and two companies with defrauding investors in
a pair of so-called ICOs purportedly backed by investments in real estate and diamonds (see Securities and
Exchange Commission v. REcoin Group Foundation, LLC, et al., Civil Action NO. 17-cv- 05725 (E.D.N.Y, filed
Sept. 29, 2017)). Subsequently, the SEC has filed several orders instituting cease-and-desist proceedings
against (i) Carrier EQ, Inc., d/b/a AirFox and Paragon Coin, Inc. in connection with their unregistered
offerings of tokens (see CarrierEQ, Inc., Rel. No. 33-10575 (Nov. 16, 2018) and Paragon Coin, Inc., Rel. No. 33-
10574 (Nov. 16, 2018), respectively), (ii) Crypto Asset Management, LP for failing to register a hedge fund
formed for the purpose of investing in cryptocurrencies as an investment company (see Crypto Asset
Management, LP and Timothy Enneking, Rel. No. 33-10544 (Sept. 11, 2018)), (iii) TokenLot LLC for failing to
register as a broker-dealer, even though it did not meet the definition of an exchange (see Tokenlot LLC,
Lenny Kugel, and EliL. Lewitt, Rel. No. 33-10543 (Sept. 11, 2018)) and (iv) EtherDelta’s founder for failing
either to register as a national securities exchange or to operate pursuant to an exemption from registration
as an exchange after creating a platform that clearly fell within the definition of an exchange (see Zachary
Coburn, Rel. No. 34- 84553 (Nov. 8, 2018)).
On June 4, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York against Kik Interactive, Inc. with respect to its September 2017 offering of Kin. According to articles
published by various news outlets, the SEC has allegedly issued numerous subpoenas and information
requests to technology companies, advisers and individuals involved in the cryptocurrency space and ICOs,
as part of a broad inquiry into the cryptocurrency market.
Recently, a number of proposed ICOs have sought to rely on Regulation A and have filed with the SEC a
Form 1-A covering a distribution of a digital token. Two such offerings were qualified in July 2019. In
addition, some token offerings have been commenced as private securities offerings intended to be exempt
from SEC registration. Further, the SEC has yet to approve listing and trading any exchange-traded products
(such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies. The SEC has taken various actions against persons or entities that
have allegedly misused cryptocurrencies, engaged in fraudulent schemes (i.e., Ponzi scheme) and/or
engaged in the sale of tokens that were deemed securities by the SEC.
Although Bitdeer’s activities are not focused on raising capital or assisting others that do so, the
federal securities laws are very broad. Bitdeer cannot provide assurance as to whether the SEC will continue
or increase its enforcement with respect to cryptocurrencies or ICOs, including taking enforcement action
against any person engaged in the sale of unregistered securities in violation of the Securities Act or any
person acting as an unregistered investment company in violation of the Investment Company Act. Because
the SEC has held that certain cryptocurrencies are securities based on the current rules and law, Bitdeer may
be required to register and comply with the rules and regulations under federal securities laws.
Bitdeer cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of
cryptocurrencies under the law, including, but not limited to, whether cryptocurrencies will be classified as a
security, commodity, currency and/or new or other existing classification. Such additional regulations may
result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely affecting investment in
Bitdeer. If Bitdeer determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, it
may seek to cease certain or all of Bitdeer’s operations. Any such action could have a material adverse effect
on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Federal or state agencies may impose additional regulatory burdens on Bitdeer’s business. Changing laws and
regulations and changing enforcement policies and priorities have the potential to cause additional expenditures,
restrictions, and delays in connection with Bitdeer’s business operations.
Federal and state laws and regulations may be subject to change or changes in enforcement policies or
priorities, including changes that may result from changes in the political landscape and changing
technologies.
84 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Future legislation and regulations, changes to existing laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, or
changes in enforcement policies or priorities, could require significant management attention and cause
additional expenditures, restrictions, and delays in connection with Bitdeer’s business operations.
Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders, customers, government regulators and other
market participants with respect to Bitdeer’s Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) policies may impose
additional costs on Bitdeer or expose Bitdeer to additional risks.
Companies across all industries and around the globe are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their
ESG policies. Investors, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices and
in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. In
February 2021, the Acting Chair of the SEC issued a statement directing the Division of Corporation Finance
to enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings and in March 2021 the SEC
announced the creation of a Climate and ESG Task Force in the Division of Enforcement. The increased focus
and activism related to ESG may hinder Bitdeer’s access to capital, as investors and lenders may reconsider
their capital investment allocation as a result of their assessment of Bitdeer’s ESG practices. If Bitdeer does
not adapt to or comply with investor, lender or other industry shareholder expectations and standards and
potential government regulations, which are evolving but may relate to the suitable deployment of electric
power, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues,
Bitdeer’s reputation may suffer which would have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer may be subject to risks associated with misleading and/or fraudulent disclosure or use by the creators of
cryptocurrencies.
Generally, Bitdeer relies primarily on a combination of white papers and other disclosure documents
prepared by the creators of applicable cryptocurrencies, as well as on Bitdeer’s management’s ability to
obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential implications of transacting in these cryptocurrencies.
However, such white papers and other disclosure documents and information may contain misleading and/or
fraudulent statements (which may include statements concerning the creators’ ability to deliver in a timely
fashion the product and/or service disclosed in their white papers and other disclosure documents) and/or
may not reveal any unlawful activities by the creators. Recently, there has been an increasing number of
investigations and lawsuits by the SEC and the CFTC involving cryptocurrency creators for fraud and
misappropriation, among other charges. Additionally, FinCEN has increased its enforcement efforts involving
cryptocurrency creators regarding compliance with anti-money laundering and Know-Your-Customer laws.
To the extent that any of these creators make misleading and/or fraudulent disclosures or do not comply
with federal, state or foreign laws, or if Bitdeer is unable to uncover all material information about these
cryptocurrencies and/or their creators, Bitdeer may not be able to make a fully informed business decision
relating to Bitdeer’s transacting in or otherwise involving such cryptocurrencies, which could have a material
adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Bitdeer’s management and compliance personnel have limited experience handling a listed cryptocurrency mining-
related services company, and Bitdeer’s compliance program has a recent history only.
Bitdeer’s management and compliance personnel have limited experience in handling regulatory and
compliance matters relating to a listed cryptocurrency mining-related services company. Bitdeer’s key
compliance documents and compliance programs, such as AML and KYC procedures, also have a recent
history only. Bitdeer believes that is has measures designed to limit its counterparty risks. For example,
Bitdeer has been monitoring its investments closely and limiting its exposure to the investment risk by
including in its operation strategy the requirements to invest only in robust wealth management products
and that the investments need to be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter. In order to further limit its
exposure to counterparty risk, Bitdeer adopted an operation strategy in December 2022, pursuant to which
Bitdeer shall not enter into any digital asset based lending or wealth management products in the foreseeable
future. While Bitdeer has been devoting a substantial amount of time and resources to various compliance
initiatives and risk management measures, including but not limited to, recruiting a dedicated team of
compliance expertise, Bitdeer cannot assure you the practical application and effectiveness of its compliance
program and risk

management measures, nor that there will not be a failure in detecting regulatory compliance issues or
managing risk exposure, which may adversely affect its reputation, business, financial condition and results
of operations.
Risks Related to BSGA and the Business Combination
Unless otherwise stated or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “our
company,” and “BSGA” refer to Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp.
BSGA will be forced to liquidate the Trust Account if it cannot consummate a business combination by the
Combination Deadline. In the event of a liquidation, BSGA’s public shareholders will receive US$10.87 per share
and the BSGA Rights will expire worthless.
If BSGA is unable to complete a business combination by the Combination Deadline, and is forced to
liquidate, the per-share liquidation distribution will be US$10.87, without taking into account additional
deposits into the Trust Account to further extend the date by which BSGA has to consummate a business
combination as allowed pursuant to the Existing BSGA Articles. Furthermore, there will be no distribution
with respect to the BSGA Rights, which will expire worthless as a result of BSGA’s failure to complete a
business combination.
BSGA’s independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses
substantial doubt about BSGA’s ability continue as a “going concern.”
As of December 31, 2022, BSGA had US$487,303 in cash, and working capital deficit of US$6,602,257.
Further, BSGA has incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as a public company (for legal,
financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses in connection with its
proposed initial business combination with Bitdeer. BSGA cannot assure you that any efforts to raise capital
(if required) or to consummate an initial business combination (including the proposed Business
Combination with Bitdeer) will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
BSGA’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statement contained elsewhere in
this proxy statement/​prospectus do not include any adjustments that might result from BSGA’s inability to
continue as a going concern.
Material weaknesses in BSGA’s internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on
BSGA’s business and the price of BSGA’s ordinary shares.
BSGA has identified material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. In future periods,
if additional material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting are identified, BSGA may be
required to restate its financial statements and could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, a loss of public and
investor confidence, and to litigation from investors and shareholders, which could have a material adverse
effect on its business and the price of its Class A ordinary shares.
In addition, if BSGA does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and
controls, BSGA may not be able to manage its business effectively or accurately report its financial
performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in its ordinary share price and adversely affect its
results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could
potentially subject BSGA to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities,
which would require additional financial and management resources.
You must tender your ordinary shares in order to validly seek redemption at the Extraordinary General Meeting.
In connection with tendering your shares for redemption, you must elect either to physically tender
your share certificates to Continental or to deliver your ordinary shares to Continental electronically using
DTC’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian) System, in each case at least two business days before the
Extraordinary General Meeting. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery ensures that a redeeming
holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the Business Combination is consummated. Any failure to
observe these procedures will result in your loss of redemption rights in connection with the vote on the
Business Combination.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If third parties bring claims against BSGA, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share liquidation
price received by BSGA Shareholders may be less than US$10.87.
BSGA’s placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against BSGA.
Although BSGA has received from many of the vendors, service providers (other than its independent
accountants) and prospective target businesses with which it does business executed agreements waiving
any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of
BSGA’s public shareholders, they may still seek recourse against the Trust Account. Additionally, a court
may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in trust could be subject to
claims which could take priority over those of BSGA’s public shareholders. If BSGA liquidates the Trust
Account before the completion of a business combination and distributes the proceeds held therein to its
public shareholders, the Sponsor has contractually agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in
the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities
that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but only if such a
vendor or prospective target business does not execute such a waiver. However, BSGA cannot assure you
that they will be able to meet such obligation. Therefore, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account
for our shareholders may be less than US$10.87 due to such claims.
Additionally, if BSGA is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed
against it which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable
bankruptcy law, and may be included in BSGA’s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties
with priority over the claims of its shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust
Account, BSGA may not be able to return US$10.87 to our public shareholders.
Any distributions received by BSGA Shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that
immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, BSGA was unable to pay its debts as they fell
due in the ordinary course of business.
The Existing BSGA Articles provides that it will continue in existence only until the date that is 18
months from the closing of the IPO, or December 14, 2022, unless the Initial Shareholders request and the
Board approves up to four extensions, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 30 months to
complete a business combination). BSGA has elected to effectuate two extensions, as a result of which the
deadline for consummating its initial business combination has been extended to June 14, 2023. If BSGA is
unable to consummate a transaction within the required time periods set forth under the Existing BSGA
Articles, including any applicable extensions, upon notice from BSGA, the trustee of the Trust Account will
distribute the amount in its Trust Account to its public shareholders. Concurrently, BSGA shall pay, or
reserve for payment, from funds not held in trust, its liabilities and obligations, although BSGA cannot
assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as
payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately US$1,500,000 of
proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds
for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust
account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs
and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest
accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account
balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to US$50,000 of such
accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
However, we may not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As a result,
our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them
(but no more) and any liability of our shareholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date
of distribution. Accordingly, third parties may seek to recover from our shareholders amounts owed to them
by us.
If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy
petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions
received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either
a
87 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover
all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our Board may be viewed as having breached its
fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of
punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of
creditors.
If BSGA’s due diligence investigation of Bitdeer was inadequate, then shareholders of BSGA following the Business
Combination could lose some or all of their investment.
Even though BSGA conducted a due diligence investigation of Bitdeer, it cannot be sure that this
diligence uncovered all material issues that may be present inside Bitdeer or its business, or that it would be
possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside
of Bitdeer and its business and outside of its control will not later arise.
Shareholder litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations are expensive and could harm BSGA’s business,
financial condition and operating results and could divert management attention.
In the past, securities class action litigation and/or shareholder derivative litigation and inquiries or
investigations by regulatory authorities have often followed certain significant business transactions, such
as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, such as the Business
Combination. Any shareholder litigation and/or regulatory investigations against BSGA, whether or not
resolved in BSGA’s favor, could result in substantial costs and divert BSGA’s management’s attention from
other business concerns, which could adversely affect BSGA’s business and cash resources and the ultimate
value BSGA Shareholders receive as a result of the Business Combination.
The Initial Shareholders who own ordinary shares and private placement units will not participate in liquidation
distributions and, therefore, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether the Business Combination is
appropriate.
As of the Record Date, the Initial Shareholders owned an aggregate of 1,437,500 ordinary shares and
292,500 ordinary shares underlying private placement units. They have waived their right to redeem these
shares, or to receive distributions with respect to these shares upon the liquidation of the Trust Account if
BSGA is unable to consummate a business combination. Based on a market price of US$10.73 per share on
March 24, 2023, the value of these shares was approximately US$18.6 million. These ordinary shares acquired
by the Initial Shareholders prior to the IPO will be worthless if BSGA does not consummate a business
combination. Consequently, our directors’ and officers’ discretion in identifying and selecting Bitdeer as a
suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions
and timing of the Business Combination are appropriate and in BSGA’s public shareholders’ best interest.
BSGA is requiring shareholders who wish to redeem their public shares in connection with a proposed business
combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to
exercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.
BSGA is requiring shareholders who wish to redeem their ordinary shares to either tender their
certificates to Continental or to deliver their shares to Continental electronically using the DTC’s DWAC
(Deposit/​Withdrawal At Custodian) System at least two business days before the Extraordinary General
Meeting. In order to obtain a physical certificate, a shareholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and
Continental will need to act to facilitate this request. It is BSGA’s understanding that shareholders should
generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from Continental. However, because we do
not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two
weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver
shares through the DWAC System, we cannot assure you of this fact. Accordingly, if it takes longer than
BSGA anticipates for shareholders to deliver their ordinary shares, shareholders who wish to redeem may be
unable to meet the deadline for exercising their redemption rights and thus may be unable to redeem their
shares.
BSGA will require its public shareholders who wish to redeem their public shares in connection with the Business
Combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption described above, such redeeming shareholders
may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the Business Combination is not
consummated.
If BSGA requires public shareholders who wish to redeem their public shares in connection with the
proposed Business Combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption as described above
and
88 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Business Combination is not consummated, BSGA will promptly return such certificates to its public
shareholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to redeem their public shares in such a circumstance
will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until BSGA has returned their securities to
them. The market price for ordinary shares may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your
securities when you wish to, even while other shareholders that did not seek redemption may be able to sell
their securities.
If BSGA’s security holders exercise their registration rights with respect to their securities, it may have an adverse
effect on the market price of BSGA’s securities.
BSGA’s Initial Shareholders are entitled to make a demand that it register the resale of their insider
shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from
escrow. Additionally, our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors are entitled to demand that BSGA
register the resale of the shares underlying any securities our Initial Shareholders, officers, directors or their
affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us at any time after BSGA consummates
a business combination. If such persons exercise their registration rights with respect to all of their
securities, then there will be an additional 1,787,500 ordinary shares eligible for trading in the public market.
The presence of these additional ordinary shares trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on
the market price of BSGA’s securities. BSGA’s Initial Shareholders may sell all or a significant portion of
these shares upon registration of such shares for resale even if the then trading price of BTG’s securities is
considerably lower than the current trading price of the BSGA Ordinary Shares, which may further exacerbate
the ability of securities of BSGA (or BTG upon Closing) to trade at a premium to its current market price.
If the Business Combination’s benefits do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts, the market
price of BSGA’s securities (or BTG’s securities upon Closing) may decline.
The market price of BSGA’s securities (or BTG’s securities upon Closing) may decline as a result of the
Business Combination if:
BSGA does not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly as, or to the extent
anticipated by, financial or industry analysts; or
The effect of the Business Combination on the financial statements is not consistent with the
expectations of financial or industry analysts.
Accordingly, investors may experience a loss as a result of decreasing stock prices.
BSGA’s directors and officers may have certain conflicts in determining to recommend the acquisition of Bitdeer,
since certain of their interests, and certain interests of their affiliates and associates, are different from, or in
addition to, your interests as a shareholder.
BSGA’s management and directors have interests in and arising from the Business Combination that are
different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder, which could result in a real or perceived
conflict of interest. These interests include the fact that certain of the ordinary shares owned by BSGA’s
management and directors, or their affiliates and associates, would become worthless if the Business
Combination Proposal is not approved and BSGA otherwise fails to consummate a business combination
prior to the Combination Deadline. Given the difference between (i) the purchase price that the Sponsor paid
for the Founder Shares and (ii) the price of the Public Shares, and considering the substantial number of BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares that the Sponsor will receive upon conversion of the Founder Shares, the Sponsor
can earn a positive return on their investment, even if other BSGA shareholders have a negative return on
their investment in BTG.
In addition, the Sponsor, BSGA’s officers and directors, and their affiliates will benefit from the
completion of a business combination, including in a manner that may not be aligned with the Public
Shareholders. As such, the Sponsor and BSGA’s officers and directors may be incentivized to complete a
business combination with a less favorable target company or on terms less favorable to Public Shareholders
rather than to liquidate. For more details on the interests of the Sponsor and BSGA’s officers and directors,
see the sections entitled “BSGA’s Directors and Executive Officers - Conflicts of Interest” and “The
Business Combination Proposal - Interests of BSGA Directors and Officers in the Business Combination.”

BSGA and Bitdeer have incurred and expect to incur significant costs associated with the Business Combination.
Whether or not the Business Combination is completed, the incurrence of these costs will reduce the amount of cash
available to be used for other corporate purposes by BSGA if the Business Combination is completed or by BSGA if
the Business Combination is not completed.
BSGA and Bitdeer expect to incur significant costs associated with the Business Combination. Whether
or not the Business Combination is completed, BSGA expects to incur approximately US$4.5 million in
expenses. These expenses will reduce the amount of cash available to be used for other corporate purposes
by BSGA if the Business Combination is completed or by BSGA if the Business Combination is not
completed.
BSGA will incur significant transaction costs in connection with transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.
BSGA will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Business Combination. If the
Business Combination is not consummated, BSGA may not have sufficient funds to seek an alternative
business combination and may be forced to liquidate and dissolve.
In the event that a significant number of Public Shares are redeemed, BTG’s securities may become less liquid
following the Business Combination.
If a significant number of public shares are redeemed, BSGA may be left with a significantly smaller
number of shareholders. As a result, trading in the shares of BTG may be limited and your ability to sell your
shares in the market could be adversely affected. BTG intends to apply to list its BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares on Nasdaq, and Nasdaq may not list BTG’s securities, which could limit investors’ ability to make
transactions in BSGA’s securities and subject BSGA to additional trading restrictions.
BTG will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. However, BTG
may be unable to maintain the listing of its securities in the future.
If BTG fails to meet the initial listing requirements and the continued listing requirements upon listing
and Nasdaq delists its securities, BSGA could face significant material adverse consequences, including:
a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;
a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the company; and
a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
BSGA may waive one or more of the conditions to the Business Combination without resoliciting shareholder
approval for the Business Combination.
BSGA may agree to waive, in whole or in part, some of the conditions to its obligations to complete the
Business Combination, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. The Board will evaluate the materiality of
any waiver to determine whether amendment of this proxy statement/prospectus and resolicitation of proxies
is warranted. In some instances, if the Board determines that a waiver is not sufficiently material to warrant
resolicitation of shareholders, BSGA has the discretion to complete the Business Combination without
seeking further shareholder approval. For example, it is a condition to BSGA’s obligations to close the
Business Combination that there be no restraining order, injunction or other order restricting Bitdeer’s
conduct of its business, however, if the Board determines that any such order or injunction is not material to
the business of Bitdeer, then the Board may elect to waive that condition without shareholder approval and
close the Business Combination.
BSGA Shareholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of BTG Ordinary Shares as
consideration in the Business Combination and from other dilution sources. Having a minority share position may
reduce the influence that the non-redeeming BSGA shareholders have on the management of BTG upon Closing.
The issuance of additional BTG Ordinary Shares in the Business Combination will dilute the equity
interests of the Public Shareholders and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Public Shares

upon Closing. The Public Shareholders who do not redeem their Public Shares may experience dilution from a
number of sources to varying degrees in connection with and after the Business Combination. The impact of
dilution from the issuance of BTG Ordinary Shares in connection with and after the Business Combination
on a fully diluted basis is as follows:
Approximately 108,758,873 BTG Ordinary Shares are anticipated to be issued to holders of Bitdeer
Shares as consideration in the Business Combination, valued at US$10.00 per share. This issuance
represents approximately (a) 78.3% and 79.3%, respectively, of the number of BTG Ordinary Shares
that will be outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination, under the no
redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario, and (b) 94.8% and 95.1%, respectively, of
the total voting power of BTG Ordinary Shares that will be outstanding following the consummation
of the Business Combination, assuming the no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption
scenario.
1,437,500 Founder Shares and 292,500 BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares currently held by the Sponsor
and BSGA rights entitling the Sponsor to purchase 29,250 BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will be
converted into BTG Ordinary Shares in the Business Combination, valued at US$10.00 per share.
These shares represent approximately (a) 1.3% and 1.3%, respectively, of the number of BTG Ordinary
Shares that will be outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination, under the
no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario, and (b) 0.3% and 0.3%, respectively,
of the total voting power of BTG Ordinary Shares that will be outstanding following the
consummation of the Business Combination, under the no redemption scenario and the maximum
redemption scenario.
up to 4,077,203 BTG Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon conversion of US$30,000,000 principal
amount of the Bitdeer Convertible Note. This issuance represents approximately (a) 2.9% and 3.0%,
respectively, of the number of BTG Ordinary Shares that will be outstanding following the
consummation of the Business Combination, under the no redemption scenario and the maximum
redemption scenario, and (b) 0.7% and 0.7%, respectively, of the total voting power of BTG Ordinary
Shares that will be outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination, assuming
the no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario.
up to 21,893,567 BTG Ordinary Shares that will be available for issuance under the Bitdeer Plan. This
issuance represents (a) 15.8% and 16.0%, respectively, of the number of BTG Ordinary Shares that will
be outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination, under the no redemption
scenario and the maximum redemption scenario, and (b) 3.8% and 3.8%, respectively, of the total
voting power of BTG Ordinary Shares that will be outstanding following the consummation of the
Business Combination, assuming the no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario.
Taking into consideration the foregoing sources of dilution, immediately after the consummation of the
Business Combination, the Public Shareholders will hold (a) 2,293,388 shares of BTG Ordinary Shares, or
1.7% of the outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares under the no redemption scenario and (b) 575,000 shares of
BTG Ordinary Shares, or 0.4 % of the outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares assuming that public shareholders
exercise their redemption rights with respect to 1,718,388 Public Shares (the maximum amount of redemption)
immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination. Following the consummation of the
Business combination, the Public Shareholders will have approximately 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively, of the
voting power under the no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario, respectively. For
more information, please see the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information.”
The issuance of additional BTG Ordinary Shares, including through any of the potential dilution
sources, could have the following effects for Public Shareholders who elect not to redeem their shares:
your proportionate ownership interest in BTG will decrease;
the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares will be diminished;
and
the market price of the BTG Ordinary Shares may decline.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The completion of the Business Combination is subject to a number of important conditions, and the Merger
Agreement may be terminated before the completion of the Business Combination in accordance with its terms. As a
result, there is no assurance that the Business Combination will be completed.
The completion of the Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of a
number of important conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the approval of the Business
Combination by the shareholders of BSGA, listing approval by Nasdaq, and several other customary closing
conditions. Since these conditions are not satisfied or, if applicable, waived by the Outside Closing Date, the
Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party under which circumstance the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement will not consummate and you will not receive the Merger
Consideration. For more information, see the section entitled “The Business Combination Proposal - The
Merger Agreement.”
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information included in this proxy
statement/​prospectus may not be representative of our results after the Business Combination.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative
of the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the transactions been
consummated as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of BTG’s future operating results or financial
position after the assumed consummation of the transactions. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Statements present the combination of our financial information and the financial
information of Blue Safari after giving effect to the Business Combination and related adjustments described
in the accompanying notes. See the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information.”
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not reflect future events that
may occur, including any future nonrecurring charges resulting from the Business Combination, and does
not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenue or expense. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements are based in part on certain assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions may not prove to be accurate over time.
You are being offered a fixed number BTG Ordinary Shares, which involves the risk of market fluctuations.
You will receive a fixed number of BTG Ordinary Shares in the Business Combination, rather than BTG
Ordinary Shares with a fixed market value. Consequently, the market value of BTG Ordinary Shares, and of
the BSGA Ordinary Shares at the time of the completion of the Business Combination, may fluctuate
significantly from the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, and the exchange ratio in the Business
Combination might not be reflective of future market price ratios of BTG relative to BSGA securities. In
addition, the market price of BSGA Ordinary Shares may be adversely affected by arbitrage activities
occurring prior to the completion of the Business Combination. These sales, or the prospects of such sales
in the future, could adversely affect the market price for, and the ability to sell in the market, BSGA Ordinary
Shares before the Business Combination is completed and BTG Ordinary Shares after the Business
Combination is completed.
Your ownership percentage in BTG will be less than the ownership percentage you currently hold in BSGA.
Your ownership percentage in BTG Ordinary Shares following the Business Combination will be less
than your existing ownership percentage in Blue Safari as a result of dilution attributable to the relative
equity values of the companies involved in the Business Combination. Immediately after the Business
Combination, it is anticipated that (i) the former shareholders of Blue Safari will hold as a group
approximately 3.4% of the BTG Ordinary Shares and (ii) the current shareholders of Bitdeer will hold as a
group approximately 96.6% of the outstanding capital stock of BTG. As a result, you may have less influence
over matters submitted to a vote of BTG shareholders.
The Initial Mergers may be a taxable event for U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares or BSGA Rights.
Subject to the limitations and qualifications described in the section entitled “Material Tax
Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Consequences of the Business
92 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Combination,” BSGA intends to treat the Initial Mergers as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code. If this treatment applies, a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Material Tax Considerations - Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will not recognize gain or loss
on the exchange of the shares for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Business Combination.
While it is not entirely clear, BSGA intends to take the position (to the extent required to do so) that U.S.
Holders of BSGA Rights that exchange the underlying BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the
Business Combination would be treated in the same manner. However, there can be no assurance that the
IRS will not assert that the Initial Mergers (or either of the First SPAC Merger or the Second SPAC Merger)
do not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, or otherwise as a tax-free
transaction. In that case, a U.S. Holder that exchanges its BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares (including shares
received upon the conversion of BSGA Rights) for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Business
Combination will be required to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair
market value of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares exchanged. In addition, unless the Initial Mergers qualify as an “F
reorganization” it is possible that the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules, further described
below, could apply to the transfer of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares or BSGA Rights pursuant to the
Initial Mergers, depending on BTG’s PFIC status. U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares or BSGA
Rights should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial
Mergers, including in the event that they do not qualify for a tax-free treatment.
Becoming a public company through a business combination rather than an underwritten offering presents risks to
unaffiliated investors of BTG. Subsequent to the completion of the Business Combination, BTG may be required to
subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a
significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and the price of BTG securities, which
could cause BTG shareholders to lose some or all of their investment.
A traditional initial public offering involves a company engaging underwriters to purchase its shares
and resell them to the public. An underwritten offering imposes statutory liability on the underwriters for
material misstatements or omissions contained in the registration statement unless they are able to sustain
the burden of proving that they did not know and could not reasonably have discovered such material
misstatements or omissions. This is referred to as a “due diligence” defense and results in the underwriters
undertaking a detailed review of the business, financial condition and results of operations of the issuer and
its subsidiaries. In a traditional initial public offering, investors may be able to recover damages from the
underwriters in the event of misstatements and omissions in the registration statement and unavailability of
the due diligence defense. Going public via a business combination with a special purpose acquisition
company (“SPAC”) does not involve any underwriters and may therefore result in less extensive vetting of
the operating company’s information that is presented to the public. In addition, going public via a business
combination with a SPAC does not involve a book-building process as is the case in a traditional initial
public offering. In a traditional initial public offering, the initial value of a company is set by investors who
indicate the price at which they are prepared to purchase shares from the underwriters. In the case of a
business combination involving a SPAC, the value of the target company is established by means of
negotiations between the target company and the SPAC. The process of establishing the value of a target
company in a SPAC business combination may be less effective than a traditional initial public offering book-
building process and also does not reflect events that may have occurred between the date of the Merger
Agreement and the Closing.
In addition, while traditional initial public offerings are sometimes oversubscribed, resulting in
additional potential demand for shares in the after-market following the initial public offering, there is no
comparable process of generating investor demand in connection with a business combination between a
target company and a SPAC, which may result in lower demand for BTG’s securities after the Closing, and in
turn could decrease liquidity and trading prices as well as increase the trading volatility of BTG securities.
Based on the assumptions set out elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, out of the aggregate
112,869,011 BTG Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding upon consummation of the Business Combination,
Mr. Jihan Wu will hold 48,434,554 BTG Class V Ordinary Shares, with ten votes per share, constituting
approximately 88.3% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class.
Former Bitdeer shareholders other than Mr. Jihan Wu will own 60,324,319 BTG Class A ordinary Shares,
constituting approximately 93.6% of the aggregate outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, and
approximately 11.0% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class. This
concentration of ownership may
93 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
discourage, delay or prevent a change in control which could deprive shareholders of an opportunity to
receive a premium to the trading price for the shares as part of a sale of BTG, and in turn could affect the
market demand for BTG securities.
Becoming a public company through a business combination rather than an underwritten offering, as
Bitdeer is seeking to do, presents risks to unaffiliated investors as described above. As a result, BTG, as the
post-Business Combination company, may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure its
operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in it reporting losses. Additionally,
unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize. Even though these charges may be
non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on BTG’s liquidity, the fact that BTG reports charges of
this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about it or its securities. In addition, charges of
this nature may make it difficult for BTG to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.
The SEC has issued proposed rules to regulate SPACs. Certain of the procedures that BSGA, a potential business
combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase the costs
and the time needed to complete a business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which BSGA
could complete a business combination.
On March 30, 2022, the SEC issued the SPAC Rule Proposals relating to, among other items, disclosures
in SEC filings in connection with business combination transactions between SPACs such as BSGA and
private operating companies; the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell
companies; the use of projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination
transactions; the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions;
and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act,
including a proposed rule that would provide SPACs a safe harbor from treatment as an investment company
if they satisfy certain conditions that limit a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and
activities. The SPAC Rule Proposals have not yet been adopted and may be adopted in the proposed form or
in a different form that could impose additional regulatory requirements on SPACs. Certain of the procedures
that BSGA, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with
the SPAC Rule Proposals, or pursuant to the SEC’s views expressed in the SPAC Rule Proposals, may
increase the costs of negotiating and completing a business combination and the time required to
consummate the circumstances under which BSGA could complete a business combination.
If BSGA were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, BSGA would be
required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and its activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in
such circumstances, unless BSGA is able to modify its activities so that it would not be deemed an investment
company, BSGA would expect to abandon the efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to
liquidate itself.
As described further above, the SPAC Rule Proposals relate, among other matters, to the circumstances
in which SPACs such as BSGA could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act and the
regulations thereunder. The SPAC Rule Proposals would provide a safe harbor for such companies from the
definition of “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, provided that
a SPAC satisfies certain criteria, including a limited time period to announce and complete a de-SPAC
transaction. Specifically, to comply with the safe harbor, the SPAC Rule Proposals would require a company
to file a report on Form 8-K announcing that it has entered into an agreement with a target company for a
business combination no later than 18 months after the effective date of its registration statement for its
initial public offering (the “IPO Registration Statement”). BSGA would then be required to complete its initial
business combination no later than 24 months after the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement.
As a result, there is a risk concerning the implications of the Investment Company Act on a SPAC,
including a company like BSGA, that may not complete its business combination within 24 months after the
effective date of the IPO Registration Statement. It is possible that a claim could be made that BSGA has
been operating as an unregistered investment company.
If BSGA were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, its activities
would be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. Although BSGA does not believe that its
principal activities will subject itself to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company
Act, if
94

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BSGA is deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the
Investment Company Act, BSGA would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which
BSGA has not allotted funds. As a result, unless BSGA were able to modify its activities so that BSGA would
not be deemed an investment company, BSGA would expect to abandon its efforts to complete an initial
business combination and instead to liquidate itself.
To mitigate the risk that BSGA might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment
Company Act, BSGA may, at any time, instruct the trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and
instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash until the earlier of the consummation of an initial business
combination or its liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of securities in the Trust Account, BSGA would
likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount
the public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of BSGA.
The funds in the Trust Account have, since the initial public offering of BSGA, been held only in U.S.
government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in
U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.
However, to mitigate the risk of BSGA being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including
under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to
regulation under the Investment Company Act, BSGA may, at any time, on or prior to the 24-month
anniversary of the effective date of its IPO Registration Statement, instruct Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury
obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust
Account in cash until the earlier of consummation of the initial business combination or liquidation of BSGA.
Following such liquidation, BSGA would likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust
Account. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released
to BSGA to pay its taxes, if any, and certain other expenses as permitted. As a result, any decision to
liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in
cash could reduce the dollar amount the public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or
liquidation of BSGA.
In addition, even prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of its IPO Registration
Statement, BSGA may be deemed to be an investment company, in which case BSGA may be required to
liquidate BSGA. Accordingly, BSGA may determine, in its discretion, to liquidate the securities held in the
Trust Account at any time, even prior to the 24-month anniversary of its IPO Registration Statement, and
instead hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash, which would further reduce the dollar amount the public
shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of BSGA.
Risks Related to BTG
A market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of
BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
An active trading market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may never develop or, if developed, it may
not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your BTG Class A Ordinary Shares unless a market can be
established and sustained. This risk will be exacerbated if there is a high level of redemptions of Public
Shares in connection with the Closing, which leads to a significantly reduced number of public shareholders
holding BTG securities subsequent to the Closing.
The market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be volatile, and you may lose some or all of your investment
Upon consummation of the Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, the price of BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:
changes in the industries in which Bitdeer operates;
developments involving Bitdeer’s competitors;
changes in laws and regulations affecting Bitdeer’s business;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
variations in Bitdeer’s operating performance and the performance of its competitors in general;
actual or anticipated fluctuations in Bitdeer’s quarterly or annual operating results;
publication of research reports by securities analysts about Bitdeer or its competitors or its industry;
the public’s reaction to Bitdeer’s press releases, its other public announcements and its filings with
the SEC;
actions by holders in respect of any of their BTG Class A Ordinary Shares;
additions and departures of key personnel;
commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving BTG;
changes in Bitdeer’s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of
debt;
the volume of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares available for public sale; and
general economic and political conditions, such as the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, recessions,
volatility in the markets, interest rates, local and national elections, fuel prices, international currency
fluctuations, corruption, political instability, and acts of war or terrorism.
In particular, the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could be subject to extreme volatility and
fluctuations in response to industry-wide developments beyond its control, such as continued industry-
wide fallout from the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of cryptocurrency exchanges FTX (including its
affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC), crypto hedge fund Three Arrows, crypto miners Compute
North and Core Scientific and crypto lenders Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and BlockFi. Although, as
mentioned elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, Bitdeer has no exposure to any of the
cryptocurrency market participants that recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, or who are known to have
experienced excessive redemptions, suspended redemptions or have crypto assets of their customers
unaccounted for; and Bitdeer does not have any assets, material or otherwise, that may not be recovered due
to these bankruptcies or excessive or suspended redemptions; the price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may
still not be immune to unfavorable investor sentiment resulting from these recent developments in the
broader cryptocurrency industry and you may experience depreciation of price of BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares.
BTG will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq listing rules and, as a result, will
qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. If BTG relies on these exemptions, you will
not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.
Upon the closing of the Business Combination, Mr. Jihan Wu will control a majority of the voting power
of BTG’s outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, BTG will be a “controlled company” within the meaning
of applicable Nasdaq listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting
power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled
company.” For so long as BTG remains a “controlled company,” it may elect not to comply with certain
corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:
that a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors;
for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating, corporate governance and compensation
committees;
that it has a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of
independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities;
and
that it has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a
written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibility.
BTG intends to use these exemptions upon the closing of the Business Combination and it may
continue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future. As a result, you may not have the same
protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate
governance requirements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BTG will issue BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, and BTG Class V Ordinary Shares convertible into BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares, as consideration for the Business Combination, and BTG may issue additional BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares or other equity or convertible debt securities without approval of the holders of BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares, which would dilute existing ownership interests and may depress the market price of BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares.
It is anticipated that, following the Business Combination, (i) former Bitdeer shareholders (other than
the founder, Mr. Wu Jihan and the entity controlled by him (“Bitdeer Founders”) are expected to own
approximately 93.6% of the outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, constituting approximately 11.0% of
the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class, (ii) the Bitdeer Founders are
expected to own 100.0% of the outstanding BTG Class V Ordinary Shares, constituting approximately 88.3%
of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class, (iii) former BSGA
Shareholders are expected to own approximately 3.6% of the outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares,
constituting approximately 0.4% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single
class, and (iv) the BSGA Sponsor, the Sponsor Affiliates and directors are expected to own approximately
2.8% of the outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, constituting 0.3% of the voting power of the BTG
Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class. These percentages assume (i) none of Bitdeer’s
outstanding restricted share units vest; (ii) no interest accrued on Bitdeer Convertible Note and (ii) the No
Redemption Scenario. If the actual facts differ from these assumptions, these percentages will differ.
BTG will continue to require significant capital investment to support its business, and BTG may issue
additional BTG Class A Ordinary Shares or other equity or convertible debt securities of equal or senior rank
in the future without approval of the holders of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in certain circumstances.
BTG’s issuance of additional BTG Class A Ordinary Shares or convertible debt securities of equal or
senior rank would have the following effects: (i) BTG’s existing holders’ of ordinary shares proportionate
ownership interest in BTG may decrease; (ii) the amount of cash available per BTG Ordinary Share, including
for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease; (iii) the relative voting power of each previously
outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be diminished; and (iv) the market price of BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares may decline. Under certain circumstances, each BTG Class V Ordinary Share will
automatically convert into one BTG Class A Ordinary Share (as adjusted for share splits, share combination
and similar transactions occurring), but as the conversion ratio is one-to-one, such mandatory conversion
would not have a dilutive effect. See the section entitled “Description of BTG Securities - Ordinary Shares.”
Furthermore, employees, directors and consultants of BTG and its subsidiaries and affiliates hold, and
after Business Combination, are expected to be granted equity awards under the BTG Incentive Plan. You will
experience additional dilution when those equity awards become vested and exercised, for BTG Ordinary
Shares. See the section entitled “The BTG Incentive Plan Proposal - Summary of the BTG Incentive Plan.”
BTG’s dual-class voting structure may limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others
from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of BTG’s Class A Ordinary Shares may view as
beneficial.
BTG’s authorized and issued ordinary shares will be divided into Class A Ordinary Shares and Class V
Ordinary Shares. Each Class A Ordinary Share will be entitled to one vote, while each Class V Ordinary Share
will be entitled to ten (10) votes. Only BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be listed and traded on Nasdaq and
BTG intends to maintain the dual-class voting structure after the consummation of the Business
Combination.
Mr. Jihan Wu will hold all of the outstanding BTG Class V Ordinary Shares. As a result, it is expected
that Mr. Jihan Wu will, assuming a No Redemption Scenario and that all of Bitdeer’s outstanding stock
options are exercised, control approximately 88.3% of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding
BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class immediately following the consummation of the
Business Combination. Further Mr. Jihan Wu will, by virtue of his control of approximately 88.3% of that
total voting power, effectively have the right to nominate, appoint and remove all of the board of directors.
For further information, see the section entitled “Description of BTG Securities.”
The dual-class structure of BTG’s ordinary shares may adversely affect price and liquidity of BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares.
S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have recently announced changes to their eligibility criteria for
inclusion of shares of public companies in certain indices, including the S&P 500, to exclude companies with
97 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
multiple classes of shares and companies whose public shareholders hold no more than 5% of total voting
power from being added to such indices. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced
their opposition to the use of multiple class capital structures. As a result, the dual-class structure of BTG’s
ordinary shares may prevent the inclusion of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in such indices and may
cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about BTG’s corporate governance
practices or otherwise seek to cause BTG to change its capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices
could result in a less active trading market for the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. Any actions or publications
by shareholder advisory firms critical of BTG’s corporate governance practices or capital structure could
also adversely affect the value of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
Volatility in the price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could subject BTG to securities class action litigation.
In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a
decline in the market price of its securities. If BTG faces such litigation, it could result in substantial costs
and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm its business.
Future sales, or the possibility of future sales of, a substantial number of BTG Ordinary Shares may depress the price
of such securities.
Future sales of a substantial number of BTG Ordinary Shares in the public market after the closing of the
Business Combination, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of BTG
Ordinary Shares and could impair its ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.
The requirements of being a public company may strain BTG’s resources, divert BTG management’s attention and
affect BTG’s ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
BTG will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, Nasdaq listing requirements and other applicable securities rules and regulations.
As such, BTG will incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses following the completion of the
Business Combination. These expenses may increase even more if BTG no longer qualifies as an “emerging
growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other
things, that BTG file annual and current reports with respect to its business and operating results. The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that BTG maintains effective disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting. BTG may need to hire more employees post-
Business Combination or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase
its post-Business Combination costs and expenses.
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are
creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some
activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations,
in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over
time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing
uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure
and governance practices. BTG expects these laws and regulations to increase its legal and financial
compliance costs after the Business Combination and to render some activities more time-consuming and
costly, although BTG is currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty.
Many members of BTG’s management team will have limited experience managing a publicly traded
company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws
pertaining to public companies. BTG’s management team may not successfully or efficiently manage the
transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations
under the federal securities laws and regulations and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and
investors. The need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert the
management’s attention from implementing its growth strategy, which could prevent BTG from improving its
business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, BTG expects these rules and
regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for BTG to obtain director and officer liability
insurance, and consequently BTG may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar
coverage. These
98 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. These factors could also make it more difficult for BTG to attract and retain
qualified members of its board of directors, particularly to serve on BTG’s finance and audit committee and
nomination and compensation committee, and to attract and retain qualified executive officers.
As a result of disclosure of information in this proxy statement/prospectus and in filings required of a
public company, BTG’s business and financial condition will become more visible, which BTG believes may
result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are
successful, BTG’s business and operating results could be adversely affected, and, even if the claims do not
result in litigation or are resolved in BTG’s favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to
resolve them, could cause an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations,
prospects and reputation.
Bitdeer has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. In the event of any failure
to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, BTG may not be
able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares
could lose confidence in BTG’s financial and other public reporting, which is likely to negatively affect BTG’s
business and the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
Prior to the Closing of the Business Combination, Bitdeer has been a private company with limited
accounting personnel and other resources with which to address Bitdeer’s internal controls and procedures.
Bitdeer’s management has not completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Bitdeer’s internal control
over financial reporting and Bitdeer’s independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an
audit of Bitdeer’s internal control over financial reporting.
Bitdeer identified a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness over financial reporting
with respect to the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), concerning in particular the control
environment due to lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate
knowledge to design, implement and operate key controls over financial reporting process to address
complex and emerging technical accounting issues and related disclosures in accordance with IFRS. A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of Bitdeer’s annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a consequence of this material weakness,
accounting errors were identified in Bitdeer’s combined statements of operations and comprehensive loss
and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 primarily related to revenue
presentation in relation to the sales of mining machine business and the cash flow presentation related to the
disposal of cryptocurrencies earned from revenue arrangements. The revenue and cost of revenue on the
combined statements of operations and comprehensive loss and the operating and investing cash flows on
the combined statements of cash flows have been restated as included in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The material weakness could also result in other misstatements of Bitdeer’s accounts or disclosures, which
may result in additional material misstatements in Bitdeer’s annual or interim financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected.
Bitdeer has instituted plans to remediate the material weakness, including implementation of appropriate
processes with the objective of improving the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. In particular,
Bitdeer expects to invest more resources in its design and execution of its Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance
program, such as reassessing existing entity-level controls and, as necessary, implementing enhancements to
such controls. However, Bitdeer cannot predict the success of such plan or the outcome of its assessment of
these plans at this time. If Bitdeer is unable to remediate the material weakness it has identified, or if it
identifies additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to develop and maintain an effective
system of internal controls, Bitdeer may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. The
failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in
Bitdeer’s financial statements that could result in a restatement of its financial statements, which in turn
could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, BTG cannot assure you that BTG will not identify material weaknesses after the Business
Combination. Upon becoming a public company, BTG will be subject to the reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of
the
99 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Nasdaq. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could
adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public
accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of BTG’s internal control over financial
reporting that BTG will eventually be required to include in BTG’s periodic reports that will be filed with the
SEC. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose BTG to increased risk of fraud or
misuse of corporate assets and subject BTG to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which BTG is
listed, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. BTG may also be required to restate its
financial statements from prior periods. If BTG fails to achieve and maintain an effective internal control
environment, it could suffer material misstatements in its financial statements and fail to meet its reporting
obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in BTG’s reported financial information.
This could in turn limit BTG’s access to capital markets, harm its financial condition and results of
operations, and lead to a decline in the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
Recent market volatility could impact the stock price and trading volume of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
The trading market for the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could be impacted by recent market volatility.
While Bitdeer does not believe that it is more likely to be affected by market volatility than other public
companies, recent stock run-ups, divergences in valuation ratios relative to those seen during traditional
markets, high short interest or short squeezes, and strong and atypical retail investor interest in the markets
may impact the demand for the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
A possible “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that
largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. Investors may
purchase BTG Class A Ordinary Shares to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of the BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares. Speculation on the price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may involve both long
and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares available for purchase (for example, in the event that large redemption requests dramatically affect
liquidity), investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares for delivery to lenders. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of the BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.” A short squeeze could lead to
volatile price movements in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that are not directly correlated to the operating
performance of Bitdeer.
It is not expected that BTG will pay dividends in the foreseeable future after the Business Combination.
It is expected that BTG will retain most, if not all, of its available funds and any future earnings after the
Business Combination to fund the development and growth of its business. As a result, it is not expected
that BTG will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Following completion of the Business Combination, BTG’s board of directors will have complete
discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if the board of directors decides to declare and pay
dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on the future results of
operations and cash flow, capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by
BTG from subsidiaries, BTG’s financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant
by the board of directors. There is no guarantee that the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will appreciate in
value after the Business Combination or that the trading price of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will not
decline.
If securities and industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or cease
publishing research about BTG, the price and trading volume of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could decline
significantly.
The trading market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will depend, in part, on the research and reports
that securities or industry analysts publish about BTG or its business. BTG may be unable to sustain
coverage by well-regarded securities and industry analysts. If either none or only a limited number of
securities or industry analysts maintain coverage of BTG, or if these securities or industry analysts are not
widely respected within the general investment community, the demand for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares
could decrease, which might cause its price and trading volume to decline significantly. In the event that
BTG obtains securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover BTG
downgrade their assessment of
100 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BTG or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about BTG’s business, the market price and liquidity for
BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could be negatively impacted.
BTG is a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such it is exempt
from certain provisions applicable to domestic public companies in the United States.
Because BTG is a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, it is exempt from certain provisions of
the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers,
including: (i) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or
current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC; (ii) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of
proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; (iii) the
sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading
activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and (iv) the selective
disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.
BTG will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal
year. In addition, BTG intends to publish its results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed
pursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases relating to financial results and material
events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information Bitdeer is required to file
with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the
SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information,
which would be made available to you, were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.
As an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BTG is permitted to adopt certain home country
practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from Nasdaq corporate governance
listing standards; these practices may afford less protection to holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares than they
would enjoy if BTG complied fully with Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.
BTG is an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and, after the consummation of the
Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, will be listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq market rules
permit a foreign private issuer like BTG to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country.
Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is BTG’s home country, may differ
significantly from Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards applicable to domestic U.S. companies.
Among other things, BTG is not required to have: (i) a majority of the board of directors consist of
independent directors; (ii) a compensation committee consisting of independent directors; (iii) a nominating
committee consisting of independent directors; or (iv) regularly scheduled executive sessions with only
independent directors each year.
Although not required and as may be changed from time to time, BTG intends to have, as of the
consummation of the Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, a majority-independent
board of directors, a majority-independent compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to
the foregoing, BTG intends to rely on the exemptions listed above. As a result, you may not be provided with
the benefits of certain corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq applicable to U.S. domestic public
companies. See the section entitled “BTG’s Directors and Officers Following the Business Combination - 
Foreign Private Issuer Status.”
You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through U.S. courts may
be limited, because BTG is incorporated under the law of the Cayman Islands, BTG conducts a substantial portion
of its operations and a majority of its directors and executive officers reside outside of the United States.
BTG is an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and
following the Business Combination, will conduct a substantial portion of its operations through its
subsidiary, Bitdeer, outside the United States. A substantial portion of BTG’s assets are located outside of
the United States. A majority of BTG’s officers and directors reside outside the United States and a
substantial portion of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it
could be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against BTG or against these individuals outside
of the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed upon under the
applicable securities laws or
101 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and
of the jurisdictions that comprise the Southeast Asian region could render you unable to enforce a judgment
against BTG’s assets or the assets of BTG’s directors and officers.
In addition, BTG’s corporate affairs will be governed by the amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association of BTG, the Cayman Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The
common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the
Cayman Islands as well as from the common law of England, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive
authority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of BTG’s ordinary shareholders
and the fiduciary duties of BTG’s directors under Cayman Islands law may not be as clearly established as
they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular,
the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws than the United States. Some U.S. states, such as
Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman
Islands.
Shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like BTG have no general rights under Cayman
Islands law to inspect corporate records or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies.
BTG’s directors will have discretion under the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
of BTG to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, BTG’s corporate records may be inspected
by its ordinary shareholders, but BTG is not obliged to make them available to the ordinary shareholders.
This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for
a shareholder to motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest. See
the section entitled “Description of BTG Securities - Ordinary Shares - Inspection of Books and Records.”
Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is BTG’s home country, differ
significantly from requirements for companies incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States.
To the extent BTG chooses to follow home country practice with respect to corporate governance matters, its
shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations
applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. See the section entitled “BTG’s Directors and Officers Following the
Business Combination - Foreign Private Issuer Status.”
As a result of all of the above, BTG’s shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests
in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders
than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the United States.
BTG is an “emerging growth company,” as defined under the federal securities laws, and BTG cannot be certain if
the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make the BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares less attractive to investors.
BTG is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Securities Act, and BTG intends to take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, among other things, not being required to
comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and reduced
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a
nonbinding shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden
parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, holders of BTG Ordinary Shares may not have
access to certain information that they may deem important.
BTG will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a)
following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination, (b) in which BTG has total annual
gross revenues of at least US$1.07 billion, (c) or in which BTG is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which
means the market value of BTG’s Shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds US$700 million as of the last
business day of BTG’s prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which BTG issued more than US$1.0
billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. If some investors find the BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares, the price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be more volatile and the price of the BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares may decline.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
We believe that BSGA (the predecessor to BTG) was a PFIC for its 2021 and 2022 taxable years, and BTG may be
or become a PFIC, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of BTG Class
A Ordinary Shares.
In general, a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in
which (i) 50% or more of the average value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a weighted
quarterly average) consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income, or (ii)
75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends,
interest, royalties, rents, investment gains, net gains from the sales of property that does not give rise to any
income and net gains from the sale of commodities (subject to certain exceptions, such as an exception for
certain income derived in the active conduct of a trade or business). Cash and cash equivalents are, and
cryptocurrency balances are likely, passive assets. The value of goodwill will generally be treated as an
active or passive asset based on the nature of the income produced in the activity to which the goodwill is
attributable. For purposes of the PFIC rules, a non-U.S. corporation that owns, directly or indirectly, at least
25% by value of the stock of another corporation is treated as if it held its proportionate share of the assets
of the other corporation, and received directly its proportionate share of the income of the other corporation.
BSGA believes that it did not qualify for the PFIC “start-up exception”  (as described in “Material
Taxation Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Passive Foreign Investment
Company Rules”) for its taxable year ended December 31, 2021. Therefore, because BSGA is a blank-check
company with no current active business, based on the composition of BSGA’s income and assets, BSGA
believes that it was a PFIC for its taxable years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.
Furthermore, the PFIC status of BSGA may affect the PFIC status of BTG for BTG’s taxable year ending
December 31, 2023. Assuming that the Initial Mergers qualify as a Reorganization, BTG should be treated as
the same corporation as BSGA for purposes of the PFIC rules. Depending on the closing date of the
Business Combination and the composition of BTG’s income and assets and the estimated value of BTG’s
assets, including goodwill, BTG may be a PFIC for its taxable year ending December 31, 2023. BTG’s PFIC
status for any taxable year is a factual annual determination that can be made only after the end of that year
and will depend on the composition of BTG’s income and assets and the value of its assets from time to time
(including the value of its goodwill, which may be determined in large part by reference to the market price of
the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares from time to time, which could be volatile) and, for the taxable year in which
the Business Combination occurs, the income and assets, and the value of the assets, of its predecessor
BSGA (assuming that the Initial Mergers qualify as an F Reorganization). In addition, the risk of BTG being a
PFIC for any taxable year will increase if its market capitalization declines substantially during that year.
Furthermore, whether and to which extent BTG’s income and assets, including goodwill, will be characterized
as active or passive will depend on various factors that are subject to uncertainty, including BTG’s future
business plan and the application of laws that are subject to varying interpretation. For example, there is no
authority that directly addresses the proper treatment of certain items of BTG’s income, such as income from
proprietary cryptocurrency mining, hash rate sharing, or hosting for purposes of the PFIC rules and,
although BTG currently treats these items of income as active, such treatment is uncertain. Moreover, certain
of BTG’s business activities generate passive income and, although the amount of such income is currently
small, BTG’s risk of being a PFIC will increase if the proportion of BTG’s revenue earned from such business
activities increases in future taxable years. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that BTG will not be a
PFIC for its current or any future taxable year.
Even if BTG is not a PFIC for its taxable year ending December 31, 2023 or any subsequent taxable year,
if BSGA is or was a PFIC (as BSGA believes to be the case for its 2021 and 2022 taxable years, and which may
be the case for its 2023 taxable year) for any taxable year during the holding period of a U.S. Holder (as
defined in “Material Taxation Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) in its
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares (including BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares received with respect to BSGA
Rights), and such U.S. Holder did not (or could not) make any of the PFIC Elections discussed under
“Material Taxation Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations  -  Passive Foreign
Investment Company Rules”, then, although not free from doubt, BTG would also be treated as a PFIC as to
such U.S. Holder with respect to the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the Initial Mergers, unless
such U.S. Holder makes a purging election with respect to its shares, as described under “Material Taxation
Considerations  -  Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations  -  Passive Foreign Investment Company
Rules.”
103 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, if BSGA is or was a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owned BSGA
Rights, and assuming a QEF election is not available with respect to the BSGA Rights, the U.S. Holder may
be subject to the general PFIC rules with respect to the shares underlying the BSGA Rights, even if the U.S.
Holder made a QEF election with respect to its other BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, unless a purging
election is made.
If BTG is (or is treated with respect to a U.S. Holder as) a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S.
Holder owns BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, the U.S. Holder generally will be subject to adverse U.S. federal
income tax consequences, including increased tax liability on disposition gains and certain “excess
distributions” and additional reporting requirements. Prospective U.S. Holders of BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares should consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the PFIC rules to BTG and the risks of
owning equity securities in a company that may be a PFIC. See “Material Taxation Considerations - Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”
Because under certain attribution rules BTG’s non-U.S. subsidiaries may be treated as controlled foreign
corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there could be adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to
certain U.S. Holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares who own, directly or indirectly, ten percent or more of BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each “Ten Percent Shareholder”  (as defined below) in a non-U.S.
corporation that is classified as a “controlled foreign corporation”  (a “CFC”) generally is required to include
in income such Ten Percent Shareholder’s pro rata share of the CFC’s “Subpart F income,” investment of
earnings in U.S. property, and “global intangible low-taxed income,” even if the CFC has made no
distributions to its shareholders. Subpart F income generally includes dividends, interest, rents, royalties,
gains from the sale of securities and income from certain transactions with related parties, and “global
intangible low-taxed income” generally consists of net income of the CFC, other than Subpart F income and
certain other types of income, in excess of certain thresholds. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be
classified as a CFC if Ten Percent Shareholders own, directly, indirectly or constructively (through
attribution), more than 50% of either the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote
of such corporation or of the total value of the stock of such corporation. A “Ten Percent Shareholder” is a
United States person (as defined by the Code) who owns or is considered to own, directly, indirectly or
constructively, 10% or more of either the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote
of such corporation or the total value of the stock of such corporation. The determination of CFC status is
complex and includes certain “downward attribution” rules pursuant to which BTG’s non-U.S. subsidiaries
may be treated as constructively owned by BTG’s U.S. subsidiaries and, therefore, BTG’s non-U.S.
subsidiaries may be treated as CFCs. Prospective holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that may be or
become Ten Percent Shareholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the potential adverse tax
consequences of investing in BTG.
Future changes to tax laws could materially and adversely affect BTG and reduce net returns to BTG’s
shareholders.
BTG’s tax treatment is subject to changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, or the interpretation
thereof, tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration, and the practices of tax authorities in
jurisdictions in which BTG operates. The income and other tax rules in the jurisdictions in which BTG
operates are constantly under review by taxing authorities and other governmental bodies. Changes to tax
laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect BTG or its shareholders. BTG
is unable to predict what tax proposals may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such
changes would have on BTG’s business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax
legislation, regulations, policies or practices, could affect BTG’s financial position and overall or effective tax
rates in the future in countries where BTG has operations and where BTG is organized or resident for tax
purposes, and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. BTG urges investors to consult
with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implication of potential changes in tax laws on an investment
in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.

Record Date; Who is Entitled to Vote
BSGA has fixed the close of business on March 20, 2023, as the record date for determining those BSGA
Shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting. As of the close of
business on March 20, 2023, there were 3,505,888 BSGA Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote, of which 1,718,388 are Public Shares, 292,500 are BSGA Class A Shares held by the initial
105 • 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shareholders, 57,500 are BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares held by Maxim Group LLC (representative of
underwriters in the IPO), and 1,437,500 are Founder Shares held by the initial shareholders. Each holder of
BSGA Ordinary Shares is entitled to one vote per share on each Proposal. If your shares are held in “street
name,” you should contact your broker, bank or another nominee to ensure that shares held beneficially by
you are voted in accordance with your instructions.
In connection with the IPO, BSGA entered into certain letter agreements pursuant to which the Initial
Shareholders agreed to vote any BSGA Ordinary Shares owned by them in favor of BSGA’s initial business
combination. The Initial Shareholders also entered into a certain support agreement with Bitdeer, pursuant to
which they agreed to, among other things, in favor of the Business Combination Proposal and the other
Proposals. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Initial Shareholders hold approximately
49.3% of the outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares.
Quorum and Required Vote for Shareholder Proposals
A quorum of BSGA Shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present at the
Extraordinary General Meeting if not less than 50 percent of the shares issued and outstanding BSGA
Ordinary Shares and entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting is present in person physically or
by virtual attendance or represented by proxy.
Approval of the Business Combination Proposal, the Initial Mergers Proposal, the Nasdaq Proposal, the
Governing Documents Proposal, the Governing Documents Proposals A to D, the BTG Incentive Plan
Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal will each require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the issued and outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares present in person physically or by virtual attendance or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof.
Attending the Extraordinary General Meeting either in person physically or by virtual attendance or
represented by proxy and abstaining from voting and a broker non-vote will not have any effect on the
Proposals. An abstention or broker non-vote will be counted towards the quorum requirement but will not
count as a vote cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.
The approval of the Business Combination Proposal, the Initial Mergers Proposal, the Nasdaq Proposal,
the Governing Documents Proposal, the Governing Documents Proposals A to D, the BTG Incentive Plan
Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal is a condition to the consummation of the Merger. If the Business
Combination Proposal is not approved, the Merger will not take place.
Voting Your Shares
Each BSGA Ordinary Share that you own in your name entitles you to one vote on each Proposal for the
Extraordinary General Meeting. Your proxy card shows the number of ordinary shares that you own.
There are two ways to ensure that your ordinary shares are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting:
You can vote your shares by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the pre-paid
postage envelope provided. If you submit your proxy card, your “proxy,” whose name is listed on the
proxy card, will vote your shares as you instruct on the proxy card. If you sign and return the proxy
card but do not give instructions on how to vote your shares, your shares will be voted, as
recommended by our board. The BSGA Board recommends voting “FOR” each of the Proposals. If
you hold your ordinary shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a
broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided to you by your broker,
bank or nominee to ensure that the votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly
represented and voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting.
You can participate in the Extraordinary General Meeting and vote during the Extraordinary General
Meeting even if you have previously voted by submitting a proxy as described above. However, if
your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or another nominee, you must get a proxy from
the broker, bank or other nominee. That is the only way BSGA can be sure that the broker, bank or
nominee has not already voted your shares.

following:
you may send another proxy card with a later date;
if you are a record holder, you may notify our proxy solicitor, Advantage in writing before the
Extraordinary General Meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or
you may participate in the virtual Meeting, revoke your proxy, and vote during the virtual Meeting, as

No Additional Matters May Be Presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting
This Meeting has been called only to consider the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, the
Initial Mergers Proposal, the Nasdaq Proposal, the Governing Documents Proposal, the Governing
Documents Proposals A to D, the BTG Incentive Plan Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal. Approval of
these Proposals will each require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares present in person physically or by virtual attendance or represented by
proxy and entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof.
Redemption Rights
Pursuant to the Existing BSGA Articles, a holder of Public Shares may demand that BSGA redeem such
shares for cash in connection with a business combination. You may not elect to redeem your shares prior to
the completion of a business combination.
If you are a public shareholder and you seek to have your shares redeemed, you must submit your
request in writing that we redeem your public shares for cash no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time on April 7,
2023 (at least two business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting). The request must be signed by
the applicable shareholder in order to validly request redemption. A shareholder is not required to submit a
proxy card or vote in order to validly exercise redemption rights. The request must identify the holder of the
shares to be redeemed and must be sent to Continental at the following address:
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
1 State Street, 30th floor 
New York, NY 10004 
Attention: Mark Zimkind 
Email: mzimkind@continentalstock.com
You must tender the public shares for which you are electing redemption at least two business days
before the Extraordinary General Meeting by either:
Delivering certificates representing ordinary shares to Continental, or
Delivering the ordinary shares electronically through the DWAC system.
Any corrected or changed written demand of redemption rights must be received by Continental at least
two business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting. No demand for redemption will be honored
unless the holder’s shares have been delivered (either physically or electronically) to Continental at least
two business days prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting.
107 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Any demand for redemption, once made, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising
redemption requests (and submitting shares to the transfer agent) and thereafter, with our consent, until the
vote is taken with respect to the Proposals. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent
and decide within the required timeframe not to exercise your redemption rights, you may request that our
transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our
transfer agent.
Public shareholders may seek to have their shares redeemed regardless of whether they vote for or
against the Business Combination and whether or not they are holders of ordinary shares as of the Record
Date or vote on any of the Proposals. Any public shareholder who holds shares of BSGA on or before April
7, 2023 (at least two business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting) will have the right to demand
that his, her or its shares be redeemed for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the
Trust Account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid, at the consummation of the Business Combination.
In connection with tendering your shares for redemption, you must elect either to physically tender
your share certificates to Continental or deliver your shares to Continental electronically using DTC’s
DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, in each case, at least two business days before the
Extraordinary General Meeting.
If you wish to tender through the DWAC system, please contact your broker and request delivery of
your shares through the DWAC system. Delivering shares physically may take significantly longer. In order
to obtain a physical stock certificate, a shareholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC, and Continental
will need to act together to facilitate this request. It is BSGA’s understanding that shareholders should
generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from Continental. BSGA does not have any
control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a
physical stock certificate. Shareholders who request physical stock certificates and wish to redeem may be
unable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares before exercising their Redemption Rights and thus
will be unable to redeem their shares.
In the event that a shareholder tenders its BSGA Ordinary Shares and decides prior to the
consummation of the Business Combination that it does not want to redeem its shares, the shareholder may
withdraw the tender. In the event that a shareholder tenders ordinary shares and the business combination is
not completed, these shares will not be redeemed for cash and the physical certificates representing these
shares will be returned to the shareholder promptly following the determination that the Business
Combination will not be consummated. BSGA anticipates that a shareholder who tenders ordinary shares for
redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Business Combination would receive payment of the
redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Business Combination.
If properly demanded by BSGA’s public shareholders, BSGA will redeem each share into a pro rata
portion of the funds available in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the
anticipated consummation of the Business Combination. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus,
this would amount to approximately US$10.87 per share. If you exercise your redemption rights, you will be
exchanging your ordinary shares for cash and will no longer own the ordinary shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of the public shares, together with any affiliate of his or her or
any other person with whom he or she is acting in concert or as a “group”  (as defined in Section 13(d)-(3) of
the Exchange Act will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15%
of the shares sold in IPO.
If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, BSGA may not be able to meet certain
closing conditions, and as a result, would not be able to proceed with the Business Combination.
Appraisal Rights
Under section 179 of the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended), holders of BSGA Ordinary
Shares will have the right to dissent from the Business Combination. Should a holder of BSGA Ordinary
Shares wish to exercise their appraisal right, they must give written notice of their objection to the Business
Combination to BSGA prior to the Special Meeting, or at the meeting but before the vote on the Business
108 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Combination. Such notice must include a statement that the BSGA shareholder proposes to demand payment
for their shares if the Business Combination is undertaken.
Assuming that the Business Combination is approved, BSGA must give notice to any BSGA
shareholder who gave written notice of their objection to the Business Combination within 20 days of the
date of the Special Meeting at which the Business Combination is approved. Within 20 days following the
date of receipt of that notice, the dissenting shareholder must give notice to BSGA of their election to
dissent, which notice must include: (a) the shareholder’s name and address; (b) the number and class of
shares in respect of which they dissent (which must be all of the shares that the shareholder holds in BSGA);
and (c) a demand for payment of the fair value of the shares. Once such notice has been given to BSGA, the
dissenting shareholder ceases to have any rights as a shareholder of BSGA except for the right to be paid
the fair value of their shares.
Within seven days of the expiration of the 20-day period in which a BSGA shareholder may serve notice
of dissent (or seven days following the First SPAC Merger, whichever is the later), BSGA shall make a written
offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase their shares at a specified price that BSGA determine to be
their fair value. If, within 30 days of the date on which that offer is made, BSGA and the dissenting
shareholder agree upon the price to be paid for the shares, BSGA shall pay that amount to the shareholder
upon the surrender of the certificates representing their shares.
If agreement on the price to be paid for the shares cannot be reached, within 20 days of the expiration of
the 30-day period referred to above the following procedure shall be followed:
BSGA and the dissenting shareholder shall each designate an appraiser;
the two designated appraisers together shall designate an appraiser;
the three appraisers shall fix the fair value of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholder as of
the close of business on the day prior to the date on which the Business Combination was
approved, excluding any appreciation or depreciation directly or indirectly induced by the Business
Combination or its proposal, and that value is binding on BSGA and the dissenting shareholder for
all purposes; and
BSGA shall pay to the dissenting shareholder that amount in money, upon the surrender of the
certificates representing their shares.
Proxies and Proxy Solicitation Costs
BSGA is soliciting proxies on behalf of the BSGA Board. This solicitation is being made by mail but also
may be made by telephone or in person. BSGA and its directors, officers and employees may also solicit
proxies in person, by telephone or by other electronic means. Any solicitation made and information
provided in such a solicitation will be consistent with the written proxy statement/prospectus and proxy
card. BSGA will bear the cost of solicitation. Advantage, a proxy solicitation firm that BSGA has engaged to
assist it in soliciting proxies, will be paid its customary fee of approximately US$10,000 and be reimbursed
out-of-pocket expenses.
BSGA will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward its proxy
materials to their principals and to obtain their authority to execute proxies and voting instructions. BSGA
will reimburse them for their reasonable expenses.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “BSGA Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and other financial information
included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Description of the Business Combination
On December 15, 2021, the BSGA Board signed a unanimous written resolution approving the Merger
Agreement by and among BTG, Bitdeer, BSGA, BSGA Merger Sub 1, BSGA Merger Sub 2, Bitdeer Merger
Sub, and BSGA Sub, amending and restating the agreement and plan of merger dated November 18, 2021, by
and among Bitdeer, BSGA and BSGA Sub, pursuant to which (i) BSGA Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into
BSGA, with BSGA being the surviving entity (the “First SPAC Merger”), (ii) following the First SPAC Merger,
BSGA will merge with and into BSGA Merger Sub 2, with BSGA Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity (the
“Second SPAC Merger”, and together with the First SPAC Merger, the “Initial Mergers”), and (iii) following
the Initial Mergers, Bitdeer Merger Sub will merge with and into Bitdeer (the “Acquisition Merger”, and
together with the Initial Mergers, the “Mergers”), with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming a
wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG.
Accounting for the Business Combination
The Business Combination will be accounted for as a “reverse recapitalization” in accordance with
IFRS. Under this method of accounting, BSGA will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial
reporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business
Combination, the Bitdeer’s shareholders are expected to have a majority of the voting power of BTG, Bitdeer
will comprise all of the ongoing operations of combined company, Bitdeer will comprise a majority of the
governing body of combined company, and Bitdeer's senior management will comprise all of the senior
management of the combined company. Since BSGA does not meet the definition of a business under IFRS,
the transaction is outside the scope of IFRS 3, “Business Combinations”, and it is accounted for as an
equity-settled, share-based payment transaction in accordance with IFRS 2, “Share-based Payments”.
Accordingly, for accounting
110 • 
•

(2) 
(3) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
purposes, the Business Combination will be treated as the equivalent of Bitdeer issuing shares for the net
assets of BSGA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BSGA will be stated at historical costs.
Any difference in the fair value of the consideration deemed to have been issued by Bitdeer and the fair
value of BSGA’s identifiable net assets represents a listing service received by Bitdeer and is recorded
through profit and loss. No goodwill or other intangible assets will be recorded. Operations prior to the
Business Combination will be those of Bitdeer.
Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus
has been prepared using the assumptions below with respect to the potential redemption into cash of
BSGA’s Class A Ordinary Shares:
Scenario 1 - Assuming No Redemptions: This presentation assumes that no Public Shareholders
exercise Redemption Rights with respect to their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares for a pro rata share of
the funds in BSGA’s Trust Account.
Scenario 2 - Assuming Maximum Redemptions:  This presentation assumes that BSGA’s Public
Shareholders exercise their Redemption Rights with respect to a maximum of 1,718,388 BSGA Class A
Ordinary Shares upon consummation of the Business Combination at a redemption price of
approximately US$10.84 per share. Scenario 2 includes all adjustments contained in Scenario 1 and
presents additional adjustments to reflect the effect of the maximum redemptions.
The foregoing scenarios are for illustrative purposes only as the actual number of redemptions by
BSGA’s public shareholders is unknowable prior to the BSGA Shareholder vote with respect to the Business
Combination. Accordingly, the actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly
from the pro forma amounts presented herein.
Included below is the expected number of shares to be issued, and the related ownership interests, at
the completion of the transaction under the two scenarios:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Management has made significant estimates and assumptions in its determination of the pro forma
adjustments. As the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared
based on these preliminary estimates, the final amounts recorded may differ materially from the information
presented.
The pro forma adjustments reflecting the consummation of the Business Combination are based on
information available as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and certain assumptions and
methodologies that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited condensed
pro forma adjustments, which are described in the accompanying notes, may be revised as additional
information becomes available and is evaluated. Therefore, the actual adjustments may materially differ from
the pro forma adjustments. Management considers this basis of presentation to be reasonable under the
circumstances.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not necessarily indicative of
what the actual results of operations and financial position would have been had the Business Combination
taken place on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future consolidated results of operations or
financial position of the post-combination company. They should be read in conjunction with the historical
financial statements and notes thereto of Bitdeer and BSGA.
Note 2 - IFRS Policy and Presentation Alignment
The historical financial information of BSGA has been adjusted to give effect to the differences between
US GAAP and IFRS for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
The only adjustment required to convert BSGA’s financial statements from U.S. to IFRS for purposes of the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was to reclassify BSGA’s ordinary shares
subject to redemption to other liabilities under IFRS.
Further, as part of the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information, certain reclassifications were made to align BSGA’s historical financial information in
accordance with the presentation of Bitdeer’s historical financial information.
Note 3 - Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared to illustrate the
effect of the Business Combination and has been prepared for informational purposes only.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in
accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786
“Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.” Release No. 33-10786
replaces the existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for
the transaction (“Transaction Accounting Adjustments”) and present the reasonably estimable synergies
and other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur (“Management’s
Adjustments”). Bitdeer has elected not to present Management’s Adjustments and will only be presenting
Transaction Accounting Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information.
Bitdeer and BSGA have not had any historical relationship prior to the Business Combination other than
item as described in (I) below. Accordingly, such transaction accounting adjustments were required to
eliminate activities between the companies.

Transaction Accounting Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations
The transaction accounting adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2021
are as follows:
Represents the elimination of interest income earned from the Trust Account for the six months
ended June 30, 2022;
Represents the elimination of interest income earned from the Trust Account for the period from
February 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021; and
Represents US$32.8 million and US$33.2 million of expense recognized assuming no redemptions
and maximum redemptions (with income tax effect of approximately US$12.1 million and US$12.2
million), respectively, in accordance with IFRS 2, for the excess of the fair value of BSGA’s
ordinary shares issued over the fair value of BSGA’s identifiable net assets, as described in (G),
for the period from February 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021. These costs are a
nonrecurring item.
Note 4 - Earnings/(Loss) per Share
Represents the earnings/(loss) per share (“EPS”) calculated using the historical weighted average
shares outstanding, and the change in number of shares in connection with the Business Combination,
assuming the shares were outstanding at the beginning of the period presented. As the Business
Combination and related transactions are being reflected as if they had occurred at the beginning of the
period presented, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted
earnings/(loss) per share assumes that the shares issuable relating to the Business Combination have been
outstanding for the entire period presented.
Basic earnings/(loss) per share is computed by dividing pro forma profit/(loss) for the periods by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods using the two class method.
Using the two class method, net profit/(loss) for the periods are allocated between Class A ordinary shares,
Class V ordinary shares and other participating securities (i.e. preference shares) based on their participating
rights. Except for voting rights, the Class A and Class V ordinary shares have all the same rights and
therefore the pro forma earnings/(loss) per share for both classes of shares are identical. The pro forma
earnings/(loss) per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class V ordinary shares because the holders
of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation.

On December 15, 2021, the Merger Agreement was entered into by and among BTG, Bitdeer, BSGA,
BSGA Merger Sub 1, BSGA Merger Sub 2, Bitdeer Merger Sub and BSGA Sub, amending and restating the
agreement and plan of merger dated November 18, 2021, by and among Bitdeer, BSGA and BSGA Sub.

BSGA being the surviving entity (the “First SPAC Merger”), (ii) immediately following the First SPAC

and together with the Initial Mergers, the “Mergers”), with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming
a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG. The Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement are collectively referred to as the Business Combination. The consummation of the Business
Combination remains subject to customary closing conditions.
On May 30, 2022, BSGA entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the “First Amendment”) with BTG, BSGA Merger Sub 1, BSGA Merger Sub 2, BSGA Merger Sub
3, BSGA Sub and Bitdeer. The First Amendment extends the termination date upon which either BSGA or the

Reasons for the Structure of the Business Combination
As described above and contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination will be
consummated via a multiple-merger structure (also known as “double dummy”), consisting of the Initial
Mergers and the Acquisition Merger. Under such structure, each of BSGA and Bitdeer will merge with a
subsidiary of BTG, a newly formed company, through the Initial Mergers and the Acquisition Merger,
respectively. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, BTG will be the public company listed
124 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
on Nasdaq. The multiple-merger structure was chosen by the parties to the Merger Agreement for business,
legal and accounting reasons. In particular, given BTG’s eligibility as a foreign private issuer, its reporting
obligations under U.S. securities laws will be less burdensome compared to domestic registrants and BTG
will be able to prepare and file its financial statements in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards. Such benefit will not be available immediately upon Closing if the Business
Combination were to be conducted through a reverse triangular merger in which Bitdeer would be acquired
directly by BSGA, which would continue to report as a domestic registrant upon Closing until further
assessment of factors such as its shareholder base and location of assets at a future date pursuant to U.S.
securities laws. Operationally, following the Business Combination conducted via the proposed structure,
BTG will be a holding company that will operate Bitdeer’s current business through its subsidiaries, which is
consistent with the expectations of Bitdeer and BSGA’s management in relation to post-Business
Combination corporate and operational structure.
In addition, the Initial Mergers are structured as two separate mergers primarily for U.S. tax reasons. The
exchange of BSGA Securities (as defined in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) for BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Business Combination is intended to qualify as a tax-free
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations - Consequences of the Business Combination - Qualification of the Initial Mergers as a
Reorganization.” The Initial Mergers that effect the exchange of BSGA Securities for BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares are structured as a two-step merger in the form of the First SPAC Merger and the Second SPAC
Merger to reduce the risk that holders will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the exchange of their
BSGA Securities for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Background of the Business Combination
BSGA is a blank check company incorporated on February 23, 2021 as a BVI business company with
limited liability and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, a share exchange, asset acquisition,
share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target
businesses.
Prior to the consummation of the IPO on June 9, 2021, neither BSGA, nor anyone on its behalf, had
contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with
respect to a transaction with BSGA.
The following is a brief description of the background of BSGA’s search for and discussion with various
potential target companies.
From the consummation date of BSGA’s IPO on June 9, 2021 through November 18, 2021, the execution
date of the Merger Agreement with Bitdeer, BSGA considered a total of 16 potential target companies with
the objective of consummating a business combination. BSGA’s representatives contacted and were
contacted by a number of individuals and entities who offered to present ideas and opportunities for a
business combination, including financial advisors and companies that have their operations in either the
United States or Asia. BSGA compiled a list of potential targets and updated and supplemented such list
from time to time. Such list was periodically shared with the BSGA Board.
During the search period, BSGA and its representatives:
Identified and evaluated approximately 15 potential target companies (other than Bitdeer) across a
range of sectors including but not limited to luxury, technology, biotech, education, blockchain
enabled services and fintech;
Among the companies it had evaluated, BSGA executed non-disclosure agreements with
approximately 5 potential targets businesses or their representatives (other than Bitdeer) in order to
receive further detailed information about these potential targets;
BSGA’s representative, management and/or the board engaged in discussions directly with the senior
executives and/or representatives of approximately 5 alternative potential targets (other than Bitdeer);
and
Among the potential targets, BSGA executed a letter of intent and entered into substantive
negotiations and due diligence with two potential target businesses (including Bitdeer).
From around June 15, 2021, BSGA’s management and board were introduced to various potential
acquisition targets by BSGA’s advisors and contacts of BSGA’s management and board that might
potentially meet the BSGA management team’s preliminary target selection criteria. BSGA’s management and
board reviewed, among others, the financial performance, management team, industry and a description of
each potential candidate. Following such initial review, BSGA’s search team selected preliminarily qualified
candidates and continued with second stage review by conducting conference calls and collecting more
detailed business information of the candidates.
From June 2021 to July 2021, and again from September 2021 to October 2021, BSGA held a number of
internal meetings to discuss preliminary candidates. At each meeting, BSGA reviewed and discussed the
qualifications of those candidates. In reviewing approximately 15 potential targets (excluding Bitdeer) from
time to time, and holding discussions with their respective management, BSGA focused on three other
potential companies before BSGA identified Bitdeer as a preferred acquisition target.
Company A: On or around June 19, 2021, Company A, which is not affiliated with BSGA or to any
affiliated business entities of BSGA, was referred to BSGA’s team through a financial advisor for Company A.
Company A is a global camera developer and manufacturer. On July 5, 2021, after reviewing basic information
of Company A, BSGA’s management and board determined to proceed the discussion with Company A
diligence questions for a potential merger. At the end of July 2021, BSGA decided not to proceed with
Company A because BSGA decided to focus on its target industry of fintech, infotech and business services
and concurrently, Company A decided to pursue alternative funding strategies.
130 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company B: On June 24, 2021, Company B, which is not affiliated with BSGA or any affiliated business
entities, was referred to BSGA’s search team. Company B is a crypto mining company with operations in
Canada and the United States. On July 17, 2021, after reviewing information of Company B and holding
meetings with Company B’s management, BSGA’s management and board decided to proceed with Company
B as a potential merger candidate. On July 22, 2021, BSGA entered into a letter of intent with Company B.
From July 2021 through September 2021, BSGA’s representatives visited Company B’s office, conducted
financial and legal diligence and reviewed Company B’s financial information, management structure and
business model. BSGA team had detailed negotiations regarding the merger agreement, lockup and ancillary
terms. The BSGA board passed a board resolution on August 23, 2021, in preparation to enter into a
definitive merger agreement with Company B. However, at the end of September 2021, BSGA and Company B
decided not to move forward with the business combination due to changes in Company B’s business
operations and the expiration of exclusivity.
Company C: On June 24, 2021, Company C, which is not affiliated with BSGA or any of its affiliated
business entities, was referred to BSGA’s management team. Company C is a leading crypto exchange
platform in South-east Asia. On around July 8, 2021, after reviewing basic information of Company C, BSGA’s
management team proceeded to discuss with Company C diligence questions for a potential merger. BSGA’s
management team had multiple meetings with representatives and senior management of Company C. At the
end of July 2021, BSGA ceased its discussion with Company C because Company C decided to explore a
traditional initial public offering and alternative funding strategies.
In respect to other alternative potential targets, the reasons that discussions did not continue included
(1) a difference in valuation expectations, sometimes driven by competitive sale side auction, (2) the BSGA
management and board’s belief that the alternative potential target is less attractive than Bitdeer with respect
to factors such as competitive positioning, management experience and hash rate, (3) geopolitical risks
associated with the target’s business and (4) the stage of the potential target company’s business making
certain targets unsuitable to becoming publicly listed companies in the next 12 months.
Timeline of the Business Combination
In April 2021, Bitdeer and a prior special purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of
BSGA (“SPAC I”), were introduced to each other. SPAC I reviewed preliminary materials regarding Bitdeer.
The parties did not move forward with entering into a business combination as it became clear to Bitdeer and
SPAC I that Bitdeer would need more time to communicate with its shareholders and obtain their consent to
the proposed business combination, and that a proposed transaction could not have been consummated
within the expected timeline of SPAC I for consummating its initial business combination. Thereafter, SPAC I
executed an exclusive Letter of Intent with another target business on May 28, 2021 at which time it ceased
discussions with other potential target businesses, including Bitdeer.
On June 24, 2021, BSGA’s management team requested a member of the Sponsor and representative of
BSGA to approach Bitdeer to discuss a potential business combination.
One June 25, 2021, Bitdeer provided BSGA with presentation materials introducing its business. On the
same day and over the next few days, BSGA’s management team reviewed those material and had a general
understanding of Bitdeer’s operations, business model, key metrics and investment highlights. BSGA’s
management and board discussed a potential business combination with Bitdeer, and whether such
transaction was compatible with BSGA’s timeline for completing a business combination.
On June 29, 2021, BSGA and Bitdeer held their first in-depth discussion, which was attended by
Bitdeer’s senior management and BSGA’s board and management team. The parties discussed Bitdeer’s
business model, growth, history, suppliers, management team background, as well as commercial and capital-
raising plans. On the same day, BSGA and Bitdeer executed a non-disclosure agreement and Bitdeer granted
data room access to the BSGA Board and BSGA’s management team.
From June 29, 2021 to July 20, 2021, BSGA reviewed documents in the data room and compiled follow up
requests and diligence questions. BSGA requested further information to better understand Bitdeer’s energy
cost prices, revenue and business model, cloud hash rate details, growth and customers, among others.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
From July 20, 2021 to July 26, 2021, BSGA’s board and management team discussed certain proposed
terms to be included in a draft non-binding letter of intent for a potential business combination between
BSGA and Bitdeer. Representatives from both parties discussed the terms of a potential letter of intent.
On July 26, 2021, BSGA signed a non-binding letter of intent with Bitdeer.
In August 2021, Bitdeer entered into a letter of intent with another special purpose acquisition company
(“SPAC II”), which included an exclusivity clause. As such, negotiations and discussions between Bitdeer
and BSGA were suspended.
In October 2021 and after the expiration of Bitdeer’s exclusivity with SPAC II, representatives of Bitdeer
and BSGA had further discussions during which each party expressed its continued interest in a potential
business combination. On the same day, BSGA’s management team hosted additional due diligence meetings
with Bitdeer’s senior management, and discussed action plan and proposed timeline for a potential business
combination.
Beginning October 28, 2021, BSGA and their financial advisors and legal counsel discussed the plans
for due diligence, valuation and negotiation process.
During the period from October 28, 2020 to November 17, 2021, BSGA’s management team, and its
financial and legal advisors, conducted due diligence on Bitdeer, including but not limited to review of
Bitdeer’s corporate documents, compliance, operations, financial information, business plan, and other
material agreements. The parties held a series of due diligence conference calls, in-person meetings to
discuss follow up due diligence request and questions.
From October 29, 2021 to November 14, 2021, BGAdvisory, financial advisor to BSGA, reviewed
documents in the virtual data room, as further supplemented from information request lists, and attended
multiple financial due diligence meeting with Bitdeer over video conference and on-site.
On November 11, 2021, BGAdvisory provided BSGA with a first draft of a financial due diligence report
summarizing the findings of their financial due diligence review of Bitdeer. BSGA’s management team
reviewed the draft report and discussed certain findings with BGAdvisory. On November 14, 2021,
BGAdvisory provided BSGA with the final draft of its financial due diligence report.
From October 2021 to November 2021, counsel engaged by BSGA, including Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP
(“Davis Polk”), Shook Lin & Bok and Haiwen & Partners (“Haiwen”), conducted diligence review on Bitdeer,
covering key aspects of Bitdeer’s business and legal matters, including regulatory compliance, operations,
management and material contracts. Each such firm reviewed documents in the virtual data room, as further
supplemented by response to additional information request lists, and attended multiple due diligence
meetings with Bitdeer via video conference. Each counsel delivered its respective diligence report to BSGA
in late November 2021.
From October 29, 2021 to November 17, 2021, Royson, valuation advisor to BSGA, reviewed documents
in the virtual data room, as further supplemented from information request lists, and attended multiple due
diligence meeting with Bitdeer over video conference. On November 8, 2021, Royson provided BSGA with a
first draft of a valuation report summarizing the preliminary valuation of the Company based on the
assumptions stated in their report. BSGA’s management reviewed the preliminary valuation and discussed
the key findings therein with Royson. On November 17, 2021, Royson provided BSGA with the final draft of
its valuation report, which was reviewed by an international accounting firm and deemed to be reasonable.
During the same period, representatives of BSGA and representatives of Bitdeer negotiated the terms of
the definitive agreement. On October 29, 2021, BSGA discussed with Haiwen regarding key terms of the draft
merger agreement, including the deal structure, the lock-up requirements, the closing conditions and certain
other terms relating to deal certainty. On November 2, 2021, Haiwen circulated the first draft of the merger
agreement to Bitdeer and Cooley LLP (“Cooley”), legal counsel to Bitdeer.
On November 2, November 3, and November 11, 2021, the BSGA board and management team virtually
conducted site due diligence of Bitdeer’s facilities in the United States and Norway, and met and interviewed
senior members of the local facilities. The focus of the discussions was matters relating to Bitdeer’s mining
operations at each site.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In November 2021 and subsequent to the initial circulation of the draft Merger Agreement, Haiwen,
Davis Polk and Cooley exchanged drafts of the Merger Agreement and related ancillary documents, the most
significant exchanges of which are summarized in more details below, and in connection with each exchange
they also held a number of phone discussions and video-conferences regarding the Merger Agreement and
the other ancillary documents. In connection with these draft exchanges and discussions, Haiwen, Cooley
and Davis Polk also had regular contact with their respective clients during this period to keep them apprised
of the status of the Merger Agreement and related ancillaries and also solicited their feedback in connection
with the negotiation of the documents. The principal terms of the Merger Agreement and related ancillary
documents being negotiated during such time related to, among other things, (i) the structure and terms of
the merger as contemplated in the Merger Agreement, (ii) the scope of the representations, warranties and
covenants, (iii) the applicable conditions and approvals required to consummate the Business Combination,
(iv) corporate governance of BTG, including the Amended BTG Articles, and (v) the scope and the terms of
the Voting and Support Agreement, form lock-up agreement and other ancillary documents relating to the
Business Combination.
On November 7, 2021, Cooley sent Haiwen and Davis Polk a revised draft of the Merger Agreement that
proposed revisions to the overall suite of representations, warranties and covenants to be provided by each
party under the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, revisions to the scope of the interim
operating covenants of Bitdeer and BSGA.
On November 15, 2021, Cooley and Haiwen held telephone conferences to further discuss the scope of
representations, warranties and covenants of the parties to the Merger Agreement.
On November 8, 2021, the BSGA Board held a meeting via video teleconference. BSGA’s management
team attended the meeting and presented key findings of diligence conducted by the management and
BSGA’s legal advisors and the valuation report. The BSGA Board discussed due diligence findings and
valuation report presented by the BSGA management, as well the status of various work streams related to
the propose business combination.
From November 9, 2021 to November 11, 2021, Haiwen, Cooley and Davis Polk exchanged drafts of
Merger Agreement and ancillary documents relating to the Business Combination.
On November 12, BSGA, Bitdeer, Davis Polk, Haiwen, Cooley held a conference call to discuss certain
issues and other matters related to the November 11, 2021 draft of the Merger Agreement, including, without
limitation, the scope of the lock-up subsequent to the consummation of the Business Combination, the
scope of the representations, warranties and interim operating covenants of Bitdeer and BSGA.
On November 13, 2021, the BSGA Board held another meeting via video conference. BSGA’s
management team attended the meeting. During the meeting, the BSGA Board further discussed findings of
BSGA and its advisors’ due diligence, the valuation report and the proposed terms of the Merger Agreement.
On November 18, 2021, upon review of the final draft of the Original Merger Agreement and related
agreements, the BSGA Board signed the unanimous written resolutions and Mr. Jihan Wu, the sole director
of Bitdeer, signed the written resolutions, respectively, approving the Merger Agreement and related
agreements as well as transactions contemplated thereby. On the same day, BSGA and Bitdeer issued a joint
press release announcing the execution of the definitive Merger Agreement (the “Original Merger
Agreement”).
Subsequent to the execution of the Original Merger Agreement, in November 2021, BSGA and Bitdeer
decided to amend the structure of the Business Combination taking into account of tax, accounting and
other considerations as well as Bitdeer’s preference for BTG to list its BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in the
form of American depositary shares (“ADSs”) on Nasdaq. BSGA and Bitdeer intended to restate and amend
the Original Merger Agreement in full to effect a change in structure of the Business Combination without
affecting any underlying economic interests of BSGA or Bitdeer under the Original Merger Agreement.
On December 5, 2021, Cooley sent to Davis Polk and Haiwen an initial draft of the amended and restated
agreement and plan of merger (the “Amended and Restated Merger Agreement”) which reflected the
proposed structural changes to the Business Combination as previously agreed by the parties. During the
period from December 5 to December 15, 2021, Cooley, Davis Polk and Haiwen exchanged drafts of the
Amended and
133 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Restated Merger Agreement to reflect tax and other legal considerations and held phone discussions
regarding the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement.
On December 15, 2021, upon review of the final draft of the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement
and related agreements, the BSGA Board signed the unanimous written resolutions and Mr. Jihan Wu, the
sole director of Bitdeer, signed the written resolutions, respectively, approving the Amended and Restated
Merger Agreement and related agreements as well as transactions contemplated thereby.
On May 9, 2022, BSGA sent an email to Bitdeer outlining, among other things, the need to extend the
deadline for BSGA to consummate its initial business combination and the request to initiate a discussion on
the valuation of Bitdeer primarily considering that (i) there had been a significant drop in market
capitalization of comparable companies since BSGA’s original valuation of Bitdeer in connection with
execution of the Original Merger Agreement, and (ii) an adjusted valuation could potentially assist in
increasing investors interest of the combined company.
On May 10, 2022 and May 18, 2022, representatives of BSGA and Bitdeer discussed the status of the
proposed Business Combination, including, among other aspects, SEC’s review and comments of the
registration statement filed in connection therewith, as well as an extension of the Outside Closing Date in
light of the estimated timing for completing the Business Combination. In light of the estimated timing, BSGA
and Bitdeer agreed to extend the Outside Closing Date from May 31, 2022 to September 1, 2022. The parties
also discussed loans to be provided by Bitdeer to BSGA for funding amounts that may be required in order
to extend the period of time available for BSGA to consummate a business combination and for BSGA’s
working capital purposes. Upon such discussions, the parties agreed to an interest-free loan with a principal
amount of US$1,993,000 repayable at the closing of the proposed Business Combination.
On May 10, 2022 and May 18, 2022, BSGA and Bitdeer further discussed the need and timing on
assessing and updating the valuation of Bitdeer via video conferences. Given the continued volatility in the
crypto asset market, the parties agreed to hold off the valuation discussion until they are closer to the
closing of the Business Combination.
Between May 10, 2022 and May 30, 2022, BSGA’s and Bitdeer’s respective counsel exchanged drafts of
First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “First Amendment”),
reflecting the extension of the Outside Closing Date and terms of the loan as discussed and agreed by the
parties.
On May 30, 2022, upon its review of the terms of the First Amendment as well as the reasons therefor,
the BSGA Board unanimously approved the First Amendment via a written consent.
On the same day, Mr. Jihan Wu, the sole director of Bitdeer, signed the written resolutions, approving
the First Amendment.
Later on May 30, 2022, BSGA, Bitdeer and the other parties to the Merger Agreement entered into the
First Amendment.
From November 3 to November 14, 2022, representatives of BSGA and Bitdeer discussed the status of
the proposed Business Combination, including, among other aspects, SEC’s review and comments of the
registration statement filed in connection therewith, as well as an extension of the Outside Closing Date in
light of the estimated timing for completing the Business Combination. In light of the estimated timing, BSGA
and Bitdeer agreed to extend the Outside Closing Date from September 1, 2022 to June 1, 2023. The parties
also discussed loans to be provided by Bitdeer to BSGA for funding amounts that may be required in order
to extend the period of time available for BSGA to consummate a business combination and for BSGA’s
working capital purposes. Upon such discussions, the parties agreed to an interest-free loan, the principal
amount of which will be based on, among others, the extension payment and working capital needs, and such
loan will become repayable at the closing of the proposed Business Combination.
Between November 8, 2022 and December 2, 2022, drafts of the Second Amendment to Amended and
Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Second Amendment”) were exchanged between BSGA and
Bitdeer, reflecting the extension of the Outside Closing Date and terms of the loan with a principal amount of
US$2,584,141 as discussed and agreed by the parties.
134 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 13, 2022, upon its review of the terms of the Second Amendment as well as the reasons
therefor, the BSGA Board unanimously approved the Second Amendment via a written consent.
On December 2, 2022, upon review of the Second Amendment, Mr. Jihan Wu, the sole director of Bitdeer,
approved and entered into the Second Amendment on behalf of Bitdeer. On the same day, BSGA, Bitdeer and
the other parties to the Merger Agreement also entered into the Second Amendment.
From May 2022 to February 2023, BSGA continued to monitor the developments in the crypto asset
market.
Beginning in early February 2023, BSGA initiated discussions with Royson on updating its previous
valuation reports. BSGA’s management team also periodically updated BSGA Board on market development
and status of the transaction.
Beginning on February 9, 2023, BSGA’s management team initiated discussions with IJW for a potential
engagement of IJW to render a fairness opinion for the proposed Business Combination. During such
discussions, BSGA’s management team discussed with IJW about IJW’s experience in crypto asset
transactions and in rendering fairness opinions as well as the general background of the IJW team and their
valuation experience.
During the week of February 20, 2023, BSGA’s management team further discussed with IJW about the
fairness opinion work stream and also updated the BSGA Board on such work stream.
In late February 2023, BSGA’s management team also briefed the BSGA Board on IJW’s background and
experience, especially its experience in crypto asset transactions and experience in rendering fairness
opinions for mergers and acquisitions.
On February 24 and 25, 2023, BSGA and Bitdeer discussed updates to valuation and the development in
crypto market as well as whether to use projections of Bitdeer for the valuation analysis. During such
discussions, both parties considered the volatility of the market and the inherent uncertainties involved in
projections. Based on these discussions, the parties agreed to use key selected financial information of
Bitdeer based on the unaudited management accounts of Bitdeer for the year ended December 31, 2022 and
other internally prepared financials and certain key financial information of Bitdeer as of January 31, 2023
(the “Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer”) and hash rate as of January 31, 2023 as part of
the basis for the updated valuation analysis and not to rely on financial projections for updating the
valuation. As a result, Bitdeer did not prepare updated financial projections.
On February 25, 2023, Bitdeer provided BSGA with the Selected Unaudited Financial Information of
Bitdeer and hash rate as of January 31, 2023. See the section entitled “- Selected Unaudited Financial and
Other Information of Bitdeer” below for more details.
On February 25, 2023, BSGA engaged IJW to provide a fairness opinion to BSGA for the Business
Combination. From February 25, 2023 to early March 2023, IJW provided information requests to BSGA and
Bitdeer and reviewed information collected, and communicated with the parties about questions in the review
process through multiple emails.
On February 26, 27 and 28, 2023, BSGA and Bitdeer had further discussed the Selected Unaudited
Financial Information of Bitdeer and updates to valuation. In particular, they considered that given the
current volatile market environment, financial indicators, such as revenue and EBITDA, have become
increasingly important in determining the viability and strength of a crypto company. In addition, the parties
considered the changes in a few key parameters that contributed to the change in the discount for a lack of
marketability since BSGA’s original valuation of Bitdeer, including the progress in listing timeline, and
changes in market volatility and risk-free rate. Based on these discussions, Bitdeer and BSGA reached a
preliminary agreement on an updated valuation of US$1.18 billion, subject to respective final internal
approval from each party.
From February 27, 2023 to March 1, 2023, the BSGA Board met internally and also held a telephone
conference with IJW to discuss the methodologies and factors being considered for the fairness opinion for
the Business Combination.
135 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
From February 25, 2023 to March 4, 2023, Royson reviewed documents in the virtual data room, as
further supplemented from information request lists, and attended multiple due diligence meetings with
Bitdeer and BSGA over video conference. On March 4, 2023, Royson provided BSGA with a first draft of the
updated valuation report. BSGA’s management team reviewed the updated valuation and discussed the key
findings therein with Royson.
Between March 4, 2023 and March 7, 2023, Royson provided BSGA with updated drafts of the valuation
reports and discussed with Bitdeer, BSGA and IJW regarding assumptions, methodologies, comparable
companies chosen and reasonableness of the valuation approach. On March 7, 2023, Royson provided
BSGA with the final draft of the 2023 Valuation Report, which was reviewed by an international accounting
firm and deemed to be reasonable. For further information regarding the 2023 Valuation Report, see the
section entitled “- Reports of the BSGA’s Valuation Advisor.”
Between March 2, 2023 and March 7, 2023, counsels to BSGA and Bitdeer exchanged drafts of the Third
Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Third Amendment”), reflecting a
revised equity value of Bitdeer of US$1.18 billion as discussed and agreed by BSGA and Bitdeer and the
deletion of references to ADS structure to reflect the parties’ intention not to utilize such structure in
connection with the Business Combination, primarily due to practical inconvenience.
On March 6, 2023, upon its review of the terms of the Third Amendment, near final versions of the
updated valuation report and fairness opinion, as well as the reasons for the Third Amendment, the BSGA
Board unanimously approved the Third Amendment via a written consent.
On March 7, 2023, the BSGA Board obtained a fairness opinion from IJW, which provided that the
consideration to be paid by BSGA in the Business Combination pursuant to the term of the transaction, was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of BSGA. See the section entitled “- Fairness Opinion
of BSGA’s Financial Advisor.”
On March 7, 2023, upon review of the Third Amendment, Mr. Jihan Wu, the sole director of Bitdeer,
approved and entered into the Third Amendment on behalf of Bitdeer.
On March 7, 2023, BSGA, Bitdeer and the other parties to the Merger Agreement entered into the Third
Amendment.
BSGA Board’s Review of Valuation
Before reaching its overall decision to approve and declare advisable the Merger Agreement, the BSGA
Board reviewed the proposed equity value of Bitdeer and considerations to be paid in connection with the
Business Combination. In connection with such review, the BSGA Board reviewed a number of analysis,
including (a) the analysis and opinion of Royson, BSGA’s valuation advisor, as to the equity value of
Bitdeer, (b) review by an international accounting firm of the valuation performed by Royson, (c) audited and
unaudited historical financial information of Bitdeer and (d) fairness opinion of IJW, BSGA’s financial
advisor. The details of each such analysis and the engagement and qualifications of BSGA’s valuation and
financial advisors are set forth below. In particular, based on its review of each of these analyses and
discussions with BSGA’s management team and advisors regarding Bitdeer’s equity value, the BSGA Board
came to the conclusion that the revised equity value of Bitdeer at US$1.18 billion from the initial US$4.0
billion is reflective of recent market developments in the crypto assets space. In addition, the revised
valuation better serves the interest of BSGA’s public shareholders primarily considering that, pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, as amended, reflecting such revised valuation, BSGA’s public shareholders
are anticipated to own a higher percentage of the outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares upon consummation of
the Business Combination. For details, please see the sections entitled “Questions and Answers about the
Proposals - Q: What equity stake will current BSGA Shareholders and Bitdeer securities holders hold in BTG
immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination?” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information.” The analysis of BSGA’s management and advisors in support of the
revised valuation has taken into consideration the financial parameters of comparable companies and other
information as of a more recent date, comparing to the analysis reviewed by the BSGA Board when
discussing the original valuation of Bitdeer.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Additionally, prior to approving the Original Merger Agreement in November 2021 and the Amended
and Restated Merger Agreement in December 2021, the BSGA Board reviewed certain financial projections of
Bitdeer. However, in connection with its review and approval of the updated valuation in 2023 and related
terms of the Third Amendment, the BSGA Board did not rely on such projections, which are outdated, nor
did the BSGA Board receive any updated projections from Bitdeer, because the BSGA Board is of the view
that there are inherent uncertainties in relation to financial projections and, as described above, the analysis
of Royson, the international accounting firm and IJW along with the historical financial information of
Bitdeer served as alternative sources for the BSGA Board to review the equity value of Bitdeer and
considerations to be paid in connection with the proposed Business Combination.
Reports of Valuation Advisor to BSGA
Engagement of Valuation Advisor to BSGA
BSGA retained Royson to provide to the Board with an opinion regarding the valuation of Bitdeer.
BSGA also retained the Audit Firm to further review Royson’s work product regarding the reasonableness of
the methodologies as well as the results thereof. Royson provided BSGA with the Original Valuation Report,
the Updated Valuation Report and the 2023 Valuation Report, which were reviewed by the Audit Firm.
In selecting Royson, BSGA considered, among other things, the fact Royson, as part of its services, is
frequently engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions. Neither Bitdeer nor BSGA had previously engaged Royson or any of its affiliates or unaffiliated
representatives for any matters other than the engagement by an affiliates of the Sponsor for valuation
services in connection with an unrelated transaction. Royson received a non-contingent fixed fee of
US$220,000 as compensation for the delivery of its valuation opinions in connection with the proposed
Business Combination. Payment of the opinion fee to Royson is not dependent upon completion of the
Business Combination or the findings of Royson with respect to valuation.
In selecting the Audit Firm, BSGA considered, among other things, that the Audit Firm has a reputable
international presence with substantial experience advising companies on valuation and related matters. The
Audit Firm, as part of its business, is frequently and continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses
and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements and valuations for
corporate and other purposes. Neither BSGA nor Bitdeer had previously engaged the Audit Firm or any of its
affiliates or unaffiliated representatives for any matters and had no prior relationship with the Audit Firm
other than the engagement by an affiliate of the Sponsor for valuation services in connection with an
unrelated transaction. BSGA paid the Audit Firm a non-contingent fixed fee of US$90,000 as compensation
for the review of Royson’s opinions in connection with the proposed Business Combination.
Neither Royson nor the Audit Firm received instructions from BSGA, Bitdeer or any of their respective
affiliates. BSGA, Bitdeer and their respective affiliates did not impose any limitation on the scope of
Royson’s or the Audit Firm’s investigations of Bitdeer’s value.
Reports of BSGA’s Valuation Advisor
Royson rendered its valuation reports dated November 17, 2021, December 14, 2021 and March 7, 2023
to BSGA on the fair market value of a 100% non-controlling equity interest of Bitdeer as of September 30,
2021, December 13, 2021 and February 17, 2023 (“Final Appraisal Date”), respectively, based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein.
In connection with rendering each of its valuation reports to the BSGA Board, Royson performed a
number of processes and procedures, including the following:
Collected and analyzed the relevant historical financial statements and other financial and operational
information of Bitdeer received from Bitdeer’s management (the “Management”);
Conducted interviews with Bitdeer’s management in relation to Bitdeer’s history, operations, and
prospects of its business;
Researched the general economic outlook and the outlook for the specific industry affecting the
business of Bitdeer, its industry and its markets;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Examined the reasonableness of the information as well as other records and documents provided by
the Management, in light of their research and analysis on the industry and economic data;
Determined the most appropriate valuation method for the valuation;
Identified the comparable companies of Bitdeer;
Developed the appropriate discount rate that reflects the return of entities engaged in a similar line of
business and returns from other similar types of projects of Bitdeer;
Evaluated the business enterprise value of Bitdeer based on the assumptions and valuation methods
stated in the report; and
Consulted, reviewed and replied on certain discussions with representatives of BSGA and Bitdeer and
certain parties and their financial and legal advisors.
The opinion of value provided by Royson is based on generally accepted valuation procedures and
practices that rely extensively on the use of numerous assumptions and the consideration of many
uncertainties, not all of which can be easily quantified or ascertained. Any variation to the assumptions and
limiting conditions presented in the following report could seriously affect Royson’s opinion of value.
Royson has not audited, reviewed, or compiled the financial information provided to them and, accordingly,
Royson expresses no audit opinion or any other form of assurance on this information.
In addition, in arriving at its opinion, Royson assumed as relied, with BSGA’s consent, on the following
contingent and limiting conditions: (i) public, industry, statistical, and other information furnished by others,
upon which all or portions of this analysis is based is reliable, (ii) the information supplied by Management
was complete and accurate to the best of the Management’s knowledge and that the financial statement
information reflects the results of operations and financial and business condition of Bitdeer was in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, unless otherwise noted, (iii) the financial
statements and other related information supplied by Bitdeer were accepted as correct without further
verification, (iv) no material facts have been withheld, (v) there will be no major changes in the existing
political, legal, fiscal and economic conditions in which Bitdeer carries on its business, (vi) there will be no
major changes in the current taxation law in the country where Bitdeer operates, that the rates of tax payable
will remain unchanged and that all applicable laws and regulations will be complied with, (vii) there will be no
material changes in the industry in which Bitdeer involves that would materially affect the revenue, profits or
cash flows attributable to Bitdeer, (viii) Bitdeer and/or its partners will obtain the necessary licenses and
approvals to provide its services, (ix) exchange rates and interest rates will not differ materially from those
presently prevailing, (x) the availability of finance will not be a constraint on the forecasted growth of
operations of Bitdeer, (xi) Bitdeer will maintain its competitiveness and market share through optimizing the
utilization of its resources and expanding its marketing network, (xii) Bitdeer can keep abreast of the latest
development of the industry such that its competitiveness and profitability can be sustained, (xiii) Bitdeer
will utilize and maintain its current operational, administrative and technical facilities to expand and increase
its sales, (xiv) Bitdeer will be able to secure funds to repay its debts when they fall due, (xv) Bitdeer will
retain and have competent management, key personnel, and technical staff to support its ongoing
operations, (xvi) industry trends and market conditions for related industries will not deviate materially from
economic forecasts, and (xvii) Bitdeer has no material unrecorded and/or contingent asset/liability as at the
applicable appraisal date.
Royson’s opinion was based on business, economic, monetary, market and other considerations as they
existed and could reasonably be evaluated on, and the information made available to Royson as of, the date
thereof. In particular, Royson noted that there was significant uncertainty in Bitdeer’s industry and
significant volatility in the future development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Subsequent developments
may have affected the opinion, and none of BSGA, Bitdeer, or Royson assume responsibility for updating or
revising the opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date thereof (regardless of the
closing date of the Business Combination). Royson’s opinion is valid only as of the applicable appraisal date
and Royson takes no responsibility for changes in market conditions and assume no obligation to revise
their conclusion of value to reflect events or conditions which occur subsequent to the valuation date.
The following is a summary of the material analyses delivered by Royson to BSGA in connection with
rendering valuation reports described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a
138 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
complete description of the analyses performed by Royson, nor does the order of analyses described
represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Royson. Except as otherwise noted, the
following information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or
as of applicable appraisal date and is not necessarily indicative of the current market conditions.
Royson’s Selection of Valuation Methods
The valuation approach is determined based on professional judgment and technical expertise after
detailed analysis on facts and circumstances. Key factors Royson considered include, among other criteria,
business nature and stage of development of the subject entity, the quantity and quality of the information
provided, access to available data, supply of relevant market transactions, type and nature of the subject
asset, purpose and objective of the valuation. Royson has considered the three generally recognized
valuation approaches, namely cost approach, income approach, and market approach.
Under the cost approach, the fair market value of equity interest is determined based on the replacement
costs or reproduction costs of assets rather than the ability to generate streams of benefits in the future.
The value of a service company like Bitdeer is more driven by the future earnings to be generated than
the value of its assets. Bitdeer has established its own brand, its customer base and its business networks.
These are the intangible assets that exist in the business but not capitalized. Thus, the relationship between
the fair market value and the book costs is weak for Bitdeer. Therefore, Royson did not adopt the cost
approach.
Under the market approach, there are two primary methods. The first, sometimes referred to as the
comparable transactions method, involves determining valuation multiples from sales of enterprises with
similar financial and operating characteristics and applying those multiples to the subject enterprise. The
second, sometimes referred to as the Guideline Publicly-Traded Comparable Method, involves identifying
and selecting publicly traded enterprises with financial and operating characteristics similar to the enterprise
being valued. Different value measures or market multiples of the comparable companies are calculated and
analyzed to induce a series of multiples that are considered representative of the industry average. Once
publicly traded enterprises are identified, valuation multiples can be derived, adjusted for comparability, and
then applied to the subject enterprise to estimate the value of its equity or enterprise value.
According to Royson’s research, there were certain merger and acquisition transactions regarding
cryptocurrencies mining companies that took place in the recent two years. However, there are limited
historical and forecast operational and financial information available on these newly listed or acquired
entities. Thus, the Comparable Transactions Method was not selected.
On the other hand, several major market players in the Bitcoin mining sector have been listed. Thus, the
Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method has been selected as the principal valuation method for the
valuation of Bitdeer.
For the income approach, it relies on explicit financial forecasts which require many assumptions,
including but not limiting to the forecasted Bitcoin price, the future total Bitcoin network hash rates, the size
of transactions, the future transaction fees, the pace of market acceptance of cryptocurrency, the availability
of mining rigs and mining farms, the stability of electricity supply, etc. It is considered as inferior to the
market approach. In addition, the latest financial projection is not available for the 2023 Valuation Report and
thus, the income approach is not selected.
Selection of Comparable Publicly-traded Company Analysis
In applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method under the market approach, the fair
market value is based on prices at which stocks of similar companies are trading in a public market. A “value
measure” is usually a multiple computed by dividing the price of the guideline company’s stock as at the
valuation date by certain relevant economic variable observed or calculated from the guideline company’s
financial statements.
A major requirement in applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method is to identify
companies that are comparable to the subject company in terms of business nature and associated risks.
Comparable companies for the 2023 Valuation Report were selected primarily based on the following criteria:
139 
* 
** 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(1) principally engaged in similar business (i.e., Bitcoin mining); (2) listed on a reputable capital market for
not less than 12 months from the Final Appraisal Date; and (3) with disclosure and/ or recent market
forecasts on their key performance and financial metrics (such as hash rate and earnings before interest, tax
and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”)) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Based on the
foregoing criteria, Royson selected five companies which were considered as closely comparative to Bitdeer
(the “Comparable Companies”) listed in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom for the 2023
Valuation Report. The Comparable Companies are considered as highly but not perfectly comparable with
Bitdeer in terms of capital structure, operating scale, product mix and business performance metrics. In
addition, the Comparable Companies are major market players and have a majority of their revenue
contributed by Bitcoin mining operations. As such, Royson believes that the Comparable Companies are fair
and representative for the purpose of issuing its 2023 Valuation Report for the proposed Business
Combination. Descriptions of the Comparable Companies are summarized below:

Market Multiple
In applying the Guideline Publicly-Traded Comparable Method, different value measures or market
multiples of the comparable companies are calculated and analyzed to induce a series of multiples that are
considered representative of the industry average. Royson applied the relevant industry multiples to the
subject company to determine a value for the subject company that is on a freely-traded basis.
Royson applied the market value of enterprise value (“EV”) multiple in its valuation of Bitdeer. EV
equals to the sum of (1) market capitalization; (2) value of total debt; (3) value of preferred equity and non-
controlling interest and less (4) value of cash and cash equivalents. EV is the value of a company’s core
business operations that is available to all shareholders (debt, equity, preferred, etc.). Market capitalization
adopted represents the average of the market capitalization of the Comparable Companies for the 15 trading
days prior to the Final Appraisal Date.
Hash rate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining. More simply, it is the
speed of mining. It is measured in units of hash/second, meaning how many calculations per second can be
performed. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and can process a lot of data in a single
second. In the case of Bitcoin, the hash rate indicates the number of times hash values are calculated for
PoW every second. Thus, hash rate is considered as one of the relevant economic multiples for this
valuation.
In recent years, the prices of Bitcoins have fluctuated greatly. The Bitcoin price decreased from
approximately US$46,300 as at December 31, 2021 to approximately US$16,500 as at December 31, 2022, with
the peak on November 9, 2021 at US$67,600. As at the Final Appraisal Date, Bitcoin was valued at
approximately US$24,300. The Bitcoin halving event is expected to take place in early 2024.
The EV-to-revenue ratio looks at the revenue generating ability in the same industry. Profitability and
ability to generate operating cash flows can be measured by EBITDA which is capital structure-neutral in
nature. EBITDA is also useful for transnational comparisons because it ignores the distorting effects of
individual countries taxation policies.
In rendering the 2023 Valuation Report, Royson took into consideration changes in multiple aspects
including but not limited to certain financial and operational information of Bitdeer, the market capitalization,
revenue and certain ratios of the Comparable Companies as at the Final Appraisal Date, as set forth below. In
particular, when applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, Royson applied the multiples of
(1) EV-to-Forecasted/Actual Revenue for 2022; (2) EV-to-Forecasted/actual EBITDA for 2022; and (3) EV-to-
Hash rate as at January 31, 2023, which were the most recent available data of the Comparable Companies as
of the Final Appraisal Date.
Based on the publicly available market figures sourced from Bloomberg as of the Final Appraisal Date as
well as Bitdeer’s updated financial and operating data provided by Bitdeer’s management, Royson came up
with the following updated ratios of the Comparable Companies:

Excluded the Comparable Companies that had negative figure.
The indicated EV of Bitdeer is the weighted average of the product of the selected ratios of the
Comparable Companies generated and their relevant financial and operational information. Given the current
market and recent developments of competitors and other crypto-based companies, the importance of
revenue and EBTIDA has increased, resulting in the suggested weighting. To derive the fair market value of
the entire equity interest, the net debts and non-operating assets and liabilities are first deducted from the
indicated EV. Finally, the result is subject to a discount for a lack of marketability in order to derive the fair
market value of the non-controlling, non-marketable equity interest in Bitdeer.

Review by Audit Firm for Reasonableness of Valuation
The Audit Firm was retained by BSGA to perform a review on the valuation performed by Royson for its
opinion. The Audit Firm, among other things:
Obtained and read Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer;
Discussed with the Management, Royson and Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy firm engaged by
Bitdeer, to understand the business operations, the industry in which Bitdeer is operating and the
significant matters that would affect the equity value of Bitdeer; and
Discussed with the Management and Royson a number of key aspects of the valuation model and
report including the current market for crypto focused companies, bitcoin price, assumptions,
comparables and methodology used.
The review focused on the basis and reasonableness of the valuation, valuation methodology,
assumptions and valuation parameters adopted by Royson. The Audit Firm determined the adoption of the
comparable companies selection was reasonable and aligned with generally accepted valuation practice. The
Audit Firm also considered the calculation and market data used to determine the market multiples to be
reasonable. The Audit Firm concluded that the valuation methodology, comparable company selection,
adopted key parameters and calculations were generally accepted valuation procedures and concluded that
the business valuation performed by Royson to be reasonable.
Conclusions
The preparation of Royson’s opinion was a complex, analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description.
Royson’s 2023 Valuation Report, which was the report reviewed by the BSGA Board prior to approving
the final terms of the Business Combination, indicates that based upon the investigation, analysis and
assumptions described herein and the appraisal method employed, the fair market value of the 100% non-
controlling equity interest in Bitdeer as of Final Appraisal Date is reasonably stated to be one billion, two
hundred and fifty six million (US $1,256,000,000).
The full text of the written opinions of Royson, dated November 17, 2021, December 14, 2021 and March 7, 2023,
which set forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken in connection with the opinion, are attached to this proxy statement/​prospectus as Annex D. You are
encouraged to read the opinions in their entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the scope of the review undertaken by Royson in rendering
its opinions. Royson’s opinions are directed to BSGA and addresses only their opinions on the fair market value of
100% non-controlling equity interest in Bitdeer as of the respective appraisal date as set forth in each of the opinions.
The Royson opinions are not recommendations as to how any holder of BSGA ordinary shares should vote with respect
to the Business Combination or any other matter. The summary of the opinions of Royson set forth above is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinions.
Selected Unaudited Financial and Other Information of Bitdeer
In connection with its consideration of the potential Business Combination, Bitdeer provided BSGA
with the Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and hash rate as of January 31, 2023. The
Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and hash rate as of January 31, 2023 were reviewed by
the BSGA Board in connection with its review of the updated valuation of Bitdeer in 2023. See the section
entitled “- Background of the Business Combination.”
The Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and hash rate as of January 31, 2023 were
prepared solely for internal use and not with a view toward public disclosure. BSGA did not prescribe or
relay any instructions, guidelines, parameters, inputs, assumptions or other directions to Bitdeer’s
management with respect to the Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and hash rate
information included

in this proxy statement/prospectus. These unaudited financial information and hash rate information should
not be viewed as public guidance.
The Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer also includes adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS
measure used by Bitdeer’s management as a supplemental measure to review and assess Bitdeer’s operating
performance. Bitdeer defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2. Such measure is not
necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, such measure
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, Bitdeer’s profit/(loss) for the
periods, as determined in accordance with IFRS. For additional details, including a reconciliation of
profit/(loss), the most comparable IFRS measure, to adjusted EBITDA, see the section entitled “Bitdeer’s
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-IFRS
Financial Measure” of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Fairness Opinion of BSGA’s Financial Advisor
IJW delivered a written opinion, dated March 7, 2023 (the “Fairness Opinion”), addressed to the BSGA
Board to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
143 
•

• 
•

• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
conditions and limitations set forth in the opinion, the consideration to be paid by BSGA in the Business
Combination pursuant to the term of the transaction, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
shareholders of BSGA.
The full text of IJW’s written opinion, dated March 7, 2023, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion (which are also
summarized herein), is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by
reference. IJW’s opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the BSGA Board (solely in its capacity as such and not
in any other capacity) in its evaluation of the Business Combination (and, in its engagement letter, IJW provided its
consent to the inclusion of the text of its opinion as part of this proxy statement/prospectus). IJW’s opinion is limited
solely to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid by BSGA in the Business
Combination and does not address BSGA’s underlying business decision to effect the Business Combination or the
relative merits of the Business Combination as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that
might be available to BSGA. IJW’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any shareholder of BSGA
should vote or act with respect to the Business Combination or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, IJW, among other things:
reviewed Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer;
reviewed information relating to the industry in which Bitdeer operates;
reviewed certain internal information relating to expenses expected to result from the Business
Combination;
conducted discussions with members of management and representatives of BSGA and Bitdeer
concerning the information described in the foregoing, as well as the business and prospects of
Bitdeer generally;
reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data of certain other companies in lines of
business of Bitdeer that IJW deemed relevant;
reviewed the Merger Agreement, including a draft dated March 7, 2023 of the Third Amendment;
reviewed BSGA’s and Bitdeer’s capital structure, both pre-Business Combination and post-Business
Combination; and
conducted such other studies and analyses and took into account such other information as IJW
deemed appropriate.
In connection with its review, IJW, with the consent of the BSGA Board, relied on the information
supplied to, discussed with or reviewed by it for the purpose of its opinion being the best currently available
estimates and judgment, good faith judgment on the competitive, operating and regulatory environment and
risks, and that there are no material misstatements and/or omissions of information. IJW did not assume any
responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any such information. With
the consent of the BSGA Board, IJW relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of BSGA
and its legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting
matters. With the consent of the BSGA Board, IJW has reviewed financial information provided and the
underlying assumptions for reasonableness, but expresses no opinion thereon. In addition, with the BSGA
Board’s consent, IJW did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities
(contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of Bitdeer or BSGA, nor was IJW furnished with any
such evaluation or appraisal.
In rendering its fairness opinion to the BSGA Board, IJW primarily conducted a Selected Public
Companies Analysis and a Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. The following is a summary of the
foregoing analysis conducted by IJW and presented to the BSGA Board.
Selected Public Companies Analysis. IJW reviewed publicly available financial and stock market
information of certain publicly traded companies that IJW deemed potentially comparable to the proprietary
crypto asset mining and hosting activities of Bitdeer. Based on its review, IJW considered the following 5
144 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
selected companies (the “Guideline Companies”) to be relevant, given their business and financial
characteristics, for purposes of IJW’s analysis:
Riot Platforms, Inc.
Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc.
HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd.
Hut 8 Mining Corp.
Argo Blockchain plc
IJW reviewed, among other information, the closing stock prices as of February 17, 2023 (the date upon
which the relevant terms of the merger documents were preliminarily agreed among the parties) of the
Guideline Companies, as well as the trading prices for the fifteen trading days preceding the said date. IJW
also reviewed the EV of the Guideline Companies, calculated as fully diluted equity values based on an
average of the closing stock prices for the foregoing fifteen trading day period, plus total debt, preferred
stock and non-controlling interests (as applicable), less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and plus or
minus any non-operating assets and liabilities (as applicable), as multiples of 2022 revenue and EBITDA
estimated from publicly available research analyst estimates and other publicly available information, as well
as multiples of hashrate (EH/s).
The valuation multiples for the Guideline Companies ranged from revenue multiples of 2.16 to 13.06
(with a mean of 5.12 and a median of 3.44), EBITDA multiples of 9.36 to 18.84 (with a mean and a median of
14.10) and hashrate multiples of 87.10 to 211.75 (with a mean of 134.48 and a median of 113.94). Comparing
Bitdeer to the Guideline Companies, IJW noted that Bitdeer had comparatively higher revenue levels,
particularly from hosting activities, and higher EBITDA margins. Accordingly, IJW utilized the third quartile
of valuation multiples: EV/revenue of 3.73, EV/EBITDA of 16.47 and EV/hashrate of 170.62. Applying the
selected ranges of valuation multiples indicated EV reference ranges for Bitdeer of between US$700,000,000
and US$1,503,000,000 and equity values of between US$944,000,000 and US$1,747,000,000. Applying a
weighting to the results obtained from the selected valuation multiples of 40% to each of EV/revenue and
EV/EBITDA and 20% to EV/hash rate (being that, from IJW’s understanding, hash rate factors are likely
reflected in the stock prices of the Guideline Companies), yielded an indicated equity value of
US$1,478,000,000. IJW next applied a discount for a lack of marketability of 15%, which implied a fair market
value of equity of Bitdeer of US$1,256,000,000.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Using publicly available information, IJW reviewed the
financial terms of selected precedent transactions in lines of business that it deemed potentially comparable
to the proprietary cryptoasset mining and hosting activities of Bitdeer. Based on its review of the foregoing,
IJW did not identify any such precedent transactions that it considered to be meaningful for purposes of its
valuation.
IJW’s opinion did not address BSGA’s underlying business decision to effect the Business
Combination or the relative merits of the Business Combination as compared to any alternative business
strategies or transactions that might be available to BSGA and did not address any legal, regulatory, tax, or
accounting matters. IJW was not asked, nor did it offer, any opinion as to any terms of the Merger
Agreement or any aspect or implication of the Business Combination, except for the fairness of the
consideration from a financial point of view to BSGA. IJW expressed no opinion as to what the value of the
ordinary shares or any other securities of BTG actually will be when issued pursuant to the Business
Combination or the prices at which such ordinary shares or any other securities of BTG may trade at any
time. IJW did not express any opinion as to fair value or the solvency of Bitdeer or BSGA following the
closing of the Business Combination. In rendering its opinion, IJW assumed, with the BSGA Board’s
consent, that the final executed form of the Third Amendment would not differ in any material respect from
the draft that it reviewed, that the Business Combination would be consummated in accordance with its
terms without any waiver or modification that could be material to IJW’s analysis, and that the parties to the
Merger Agreement will comply with all the material terms thereof. In addition, representatives of BSGA
advised IJW, and IJW assumed, with the BSGA Board’s consent, that the Business Combination would
qualify as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax purposes. IJW also was not requested to, and did not,
participate in the structuring or negotiation of the
145 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Business Combination. Except as described in this summary, the BSGA Board imposed no other instructions
or limitations on IJW with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by IJW in rendering its
opinion.
IJW’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect
on, and the information made available to IJW as of, the date of its opinion, and IJW assumed no
responsibility to update the opinion for developments after the date thereof.
IJW’s opinion did not address the fairness of the Business Combination or any aspect or implication of
the Business Combination to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any creditors or
other non-shareholder constituencies of BSGA or to Bitdeer. In addition, IJW did not express any opinion as
to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the Business Combination, or any class of such persons, relative to the
consideration or otherwise.
The above summary of the analyses is not a complete description of IJW’s opinion or the analyses
underlying, and factors considered in connection with, IJW’s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion
is a complex analytical process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
In arriving at its fairness determination, IJW considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis. Rather, IJW made its fairness determination on the basis of its
experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.
The consideration was determined through arms’ length negotiations between BSGA and Bitdeer and
was approved by the BSGA Board. IJW did not recommend any specific consideration to BSGA or the BSGA
Board, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration
for the Business Combination.
IJW was engaged by BSGA to provide its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
BSGA of the consideration. The terms of its engagement by BSGA were under the engagement letter between
IJW and BSGA, dated as of February 25, 2023 (the “IJW Engagement Letter”). IJW will receive a fee for its
services based on the time incurred for providing such services. All time incurred in relation to the Fairness
Opinion shall be invoiced on a monthly basis and become immediately due and payable upon the submission
of the invoice. No part of IJW’s fee is conditioned upon the conclusion expressed in its opinion or
contingent upon the closing of the Business Combination. BSGA has also agreed pursuant to the IJW
Engagement Letter to reimburse IJW for certain expenses IJW has incurred in performing services
contemplated thereunder, and to indemnify IJW for certain liabilities, including liabilities under any statute or
common law, arising out of its engagement.
IJW may provide investment banking and other services to affiliates of BSGA and in the future may
provide services to such persons and may receive compensation for such services. Except for financial
advisory services rendered by IJW to affiliates of BSGA in connection with a prior business combination for
which IJW charged a fee of approximately US$120,000, neither IJW nor any of its affiliates or unaffiliated
representatives has performed any services for Bitdeer, BSGA or their respective affiliates in the past three
years prior to the date of the Fairness Opinion.
The BSGA Board selected IJW as its financial advisor in connection with the Business Combination
because IJW has substantial experience in similar transactions and possess significant valuation experience
in the crypto asset and blockchain sectors. IJW is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, strategic transactions, corporate restructurings, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Reasons for BSGA Board’s Approval of the Business Combination
BSGA was formed to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase,
reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more business entities. As described above, the
BSGA Board sought to do so by using the networks and industry experience of both the Sponsor, the BSGA
Board, and BSGA management to identify and acquire one or more businesses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In evaluating the transaction with Bitdeer, the BSGA Board consulted with its legal counsel and
accounting and other advisors. In determining that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby are in BSGA’s best interests, the BSGA Board considered and
evaluated a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed below. In light of the
number and wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, the BSGA Board did not consider it practicable to, and did not
attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that the BSGA Board
considered in reaching its determination and supporting its decision. The BSGA Board viewed its decision as
being based on all of the information available and the factors presented to and considered by the BSGA
Board. In addition, individual directors may have given different weight to different factors. The BSGA Board
realized that there can be no assurance about future results, including results considered or expected as
disclosed in the following reasons. This explanation of BSGA’s reasons for the Business Combination and all
other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light
of the factors discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements.”
The members of the BSGA Board are well qualified to evaluate the Business Combination with Bitdeer.
The BSGA Board and management collectively have extensive transactional experience.
In particular, in addition to its review of Bitdeer’s equity value and considerations to be paid in
connection with the proposed Business Combination (see “- BSGA Board’s Review of Valuation”), the BSGA
Board considered the following reasons or made the following determinations, as applicable:
Bitdeer satisfies a number of acquisition criteria that BSGA had established to evaluate prospective
business combination targets. The BSGA Board considered the business, history, prospects,
credibility, and valuation of Bitdeer and its affiliates, and determined that Bitdeer satisfies a number of
criteria and guidelines set forth during the IPO, including (i) unique competitive advantage in the
markets and/or underexploited growth opportunities that BSGA is uniquely positioned to identify; (ii)
strong management team that can create significant value; and (iii) potential to generate strong free
cash flow.
Favorable prospects for future growth. Information from BSGA and Bitdeer’s management regarding
(i) Bitdeer’s business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, services, management,
competitive position, and strategic business goals and objectives; (ii) general economic, industry,
regulatory, and financial market conditions; and (iii) opportunities and competitive factors within
Bitdeer’s industry.
World’s largest scale of proprietary hash rate. Bitdeer was the world’s largest holder of proprietary
hash rate for Bitcoin as at June 30, 2021, according to Frost & Sullivan. Its proprietary hash rate
provides it with a clear edge in all of its business lines and anchors its unique business model.
Unique business model powers organic hash rate expansion. Bitdeer established a business model
that allows it to reinforce its market-leading position and compete in terms of scaling up our
proprietary hash rate.
Ample power supply and low electricity cost secured by global mining datacenters. Bitdeer
strategically opened five mining datacenters in the United States and Norway, where low electricity
cost and crypto-friendly policies support stable operations. With experience in site selection, facility
design, construction and maintenance in over 30 locations around the globe, Bitdeer’s dedicated
global team for mining datacenter construction understands the critical needs of Bitcoin mining as
well as the complex and constantly evolving global landscape of electricity supply. They also have
extensive connections with local electricity experts and power enterprises around the world.
Visionary management team with a proven track record of innovation and execution. Bitdeer is led
by a management team with extensive experience in the cryptocurrency industry, encompassing
research and development, mining and sales of mining machines, and many of them are pioneers in
mining datacenters construction and operation.
In particular, the BSGA Board considered Mr. Wu’s holdings of BTG securities following the Business
Combination, and his ability to sell substantially all such holdings yet still retain control over the
company due to his BTG Class V Ordinary Share holdings. These aspects did not change BSGA
Board’s determination because (i) the BSGA Board took notice that similar dual-class shareholding
147 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
structure had been adopted by other public companies for the benefit of their founders; (ii) Mr. Wu
will be subject to lock-up; (iii) upon Closing, Mr. Wu will still be subject to his fiduciary duties under
the laws of the Cayman Islands and the Amended BTG Articles (which form is included as Annex B to
this proxy statement/prospectus) in exercising his decision-making powers as an executive of BTG;
and (iv) the BSGA Board reviewed Mr. Wu’s professional and industry experience, as well as his long
tenure with Bitdeer.
Best Available Opportunity. The BSGA Board determined, after a thorough review of other business
combination opportunities reasonably available to BSGA, that the proposed Business Combination
represents the best potential business combination for BSGA based upon the process utilized to
evaluate and assess other potential acquisition targets, and the BSGA Board’s belief that such
processes had not presented a better alternative.
Continued Significant Ownership by Bitdeer. The BSGA Board considered that Bitdeer’s existing
equity holders would be receiving a significant amount of BTG Ordinary Shares in the proposed
Business Combination and that Bitdeer’s principal shareholders and key executives are “rolling over”
their existing equity interests of Bitdeer into equity interests in BTG. The current Bitdeer
Shareholders are expected to own approximately 93.6% of the outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares, constituting approximately 11.0% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting
together as a single class, assuming none of BSGA’s public shareholders exercise their redemption
rights in connection with the Business Combination.
Use of Retained Proceeds. As represented by Bitdeer’s management, the proceeds to be delivered to
BTG in connection with the Business Combination (including funds that remain in BSGA’s trust
account after taking into effect redemptions), are expected to remain on the balance sheet of BTG
after Closing in order to fund Bitdeer’s existing operations and support new and existing growth
initiatives. The BSGA Board considered this benefits to be realized as a result of the Business
Combination.
Likelihood of Closing the Business Combination. The BSGA Board believes that an acquisition by
BSGA has a reasonable likelihood of closing without potential issues under applicable antitrust and
competition laws and without potential issues from any regulatory authorities.
The BSGA Board also considered a variety of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative
factors concerning the Business Combination, including but not limited to the following:
Business risk. The risk that the future financial performance of Bitdeer may not meet the BSGA
Board’s expectations due to factors in Bitdeer’s control or out of Bitdeer’s control, such as Bitdeer’s
failure to continuously innovate, to attract and retain customers, to adapt to new businesses, to
obtain sufficient capital, to maintain its competitive edge in the crypto mining business, among
others.
Industry risk. The risk that the cryptocurrency industry in which Bitdeer operates is significantly
impacted by the sharp fluctuations in Bitcoin prices and or significant adverse regulatory
developments.
Closing of the Business Combination May Not Occur. The risks and costs to BSGA if the Business
Combination is not completed, including the risk of diverting management focus and resources to
other business combination opportunities, which could result in BSGA being unable to effect a
business combination within the timeframe set forth under BSGA’s current charter, forcing BSGA to
liquidate the trust account.
Current Public Shareholders Exercising Redemption Rights. The risk that some of BSGA’s current
public shareholders would decide to exercise their redemption rights, thereby depleting the amount of
cash available in the trust account.
Closing Conditions of the Business Combination. The fact that the Closing is conditioned on
satisfying certain closing conditions, many of which are not within BSGA’s control.
BSGA Shareholders Not Holding a Majority Position in BTG. The fact that BSGA Shareholders will
not hold a majority position in BTG following the Business Combination, which may reduce the
influence that BSGA’s current shareholders have on BTG’s management.
Post-Closing Corporate Governance. The fact that post-Closing, Mr. Jihan Wu will control the
voting power of all outstanding BTG Class V Ordinary Shares and the voting power of approximately
88.3%
148 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of total issued and outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class assuming a No
Redemption Scenario and that, all of Bitdeer’s outstanding restricted share units vest and all
remaining Bitdeer Ordinary Shares available for grant under the BTG Incentive Plan, which will have
one vote per share when granted, are granted to employees other than Mr. Jihan Wu. Given Mr. Jihan
Wu’s voting power over the BTG Ordinary Shares as described in this paragraph, he will effectively
be able to nominate, appoint and remove the entirety of BTG’s board of directors. Mr. Jihan Wu will
therefore have decisive influence over matters requiring shareholder approval by ordinary resolution
and significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval by special resolution, including
significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of BTG or its assets.
Litigation Related to the Business Combination. The risk of potential litigation challenging the
Business Combination.
No Survival of Remedies for Breach of Representations, Warranties or Covenants of Bitdeer. The
Merger Agreement provides that BSGA will not have any surviving remedies against Bitdeer or its
equity holders after the Closing to recover for losses as a result of any inaccuracies or breaches of
the representations, warranties or covenants of Bitdeer set forth in the Merger Agreement. As a
result, BSGA Shareholders could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in the
financial performance or worsening of financial condition of Bitdeer prior to the Closing, whether
determined before or after the Closing, without any ability to recover for the amount of any damages.
The BSGA Board determined that this structure was appropriate and customary in light of the fact
that several similar transactions include similar terms and the current equity holders of Bitdeer will be,
collectively, the majority equity holders in BTG and therefore would bear a majority of any such
losses.
Transaction Fees and Expenses Incurred by BSGA. The substantial transaction fees and expenses to
be incurred in connection with the Business Combination and the negative impact of such expenses
on BSGA’s cash reserves and operating results if the Business Combination is not completed.
Negative Impact Resulting from the Announcement of the Business Combination. The possible
negative effect of the Business Combination and public announcement of the Business Combination
of BSGA’s financial performance, operating results, and share price.
Other Risks. Other factors that the BSGA Board deemed relevant, including various other risks
associated with the Business Combination, BSGA’s business, and Bitdeer’s business as described
under “Risk Factors.”
Satisfaction of 80% Test
After consideration of the factors identified and discussed in the section entitled “The Business
Combination Proposal - Reasons for BSGA Board’s Approval of the Business Combination,” the BSGA
Board concluded that the Business Combination met the requirements disclosed in the IPO prospectus with
respect to BSGA’s initial business combination, including that the Business Combination had a fair market
value of at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the Trust Account at the time of execution of the Merger
Agreement.
Interests of BSGA Directors and Officers in the Business Combination
The BSGA Board concluded that the potential benefits that the BSGA Board expected BSGA and its
shareholders to achieve as a result of the Business Combination outweighed the potentially negative factors
associated with the Business Combination. Accordingly, the BSGA Board determined that the Merger
Agreement, the Business Combination, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
were in BSGA’s best interests.
When you consider the recommendation of the Board in favor of approval of the Business Combination,
you should keep in mind that BSGA’s directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that

If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination by the Combination Deadline, we will,

the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount

deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net
of interest that may be used by us to pay our taxes payable and for dissolution expenses), divided by
the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public
shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if
any), subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and
liquidate. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our private
placement rights, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by
the Combination Deadline.
Prior to the IPO, our Sponsor held 1,437,500 Founder Shares. The Founder Shares will automatically
convert into an aggregate of 1,437,500 BTG Class A Ordinary Shares at the time of the Business
Combination.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 292,500 BSGA Units at a
price of US$10.00 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of US$2,925,000. If we do not consummate
the Business Combination by the Combination Deadline, then the proceeds from the sale of the
private placement units will be part of the liquidating distribution to the public shareholders and the
units held by our Sponsor will be worthless.
Our Sponsor has made an investment for the Founder Shares at an average price per share of
approximately US$0.017 prior to the consummation of the IPO. As a result of the significantly lower
investment per share of the Sponsor as compared to the investment per share of our public
shareholders (which was US$10.00 per unit), a transaction that results in an increase in the value of
the investment of the Sponsor in the Founder Shares (such as the Business Combination) may result
in a decrease in the value of the investment of our Public Shareholders between (i) the purchase price
that the Sponsor paid for the Founder Shares and (ii) the price of the Public Shares, and considering
the substantial number of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that the Sponsor will receive upon
conversion of the Founder Shares, the Sponsor can earn a positive return on their investment, even if
other BSGA shareholders have a negative return on their investment in BTG.
The Sponsor made an investment of US$2,950,000, consisting of the Sponsor’s US$25,000 initial
investment and the Sponsor’s US$2,925,000 private placement units purchase price. Such investment
represents an effective per share price of US$1.64. The Sponsor will lose such investment if we do not
complete an initial business combination by the Combination Deadline.
The exercise of BSGA’s directors’ and officers’ discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the
terms of the transaction may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes
or waivers are appropriate and in our shareholders’ best interest.
The Sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if BSGA fails to complete
an initial business combination by the Combination Deadline. The Sponsor and our officers and
directors have not received any consideration for such waiver.
In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable
to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a
prospective target business with which we have entered into a transaction agreement, reduce the
amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a
third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies
held in the Trust Account or to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the offering
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
Following the Closing, the Sponsor would be entitled to the repayment of any working capital loan
and advances that have been made to BSGA and remain outstanding. As of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, our Sponsor has not made any working capital loan or advances to us for
working capital expenses. If we do not complete the Business Combination within the required period,
we may use a portion of our working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the working
capital loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the working capital
loans. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no such working capital loans were
outstanding.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BSGA’s current charter contains a waiver of the corporate opportunity doctrine. With such waiver,
there could be business combination targets that may be suitable or worth consideration for a
combination with BSGA but not offered due to a BSGA director’s duties to another entity. BSGA does
not believe that the potential conflict of interest relating to the waiver of the corporate opportunities
doctrine in current charter impacted its search for an acquisition target and BSGA was not prevented
from reviewing any opportunities as a result of such waiver.
The foregoing interests present a risk that the Sponsor, BSGA’s officers and directors, and their
affiliates will benefit from the completion of a business combination, including in a manner that may not be
aligned with the Public Shareholders. As such, the Sponsor and BSGA’s officers and directors may be
incentivized to complete a business combination with a less favorable target company or on terms less
favorable to Public Shareholders rather than to liquidate. See the section entitled “Risk Factors - Risks
Related to BSGA and the Business Combination - BSGA’s directors and officers may have certain conflicts in
determining to recommend the acquisition of Bitdeer, since certain of their interests, and certain interests of
their affiliates and associates, are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder.”
Appraisal Rights
Appraisal rights are available to holders of BSGA Ordinary Shares in connection with the Business
Combination.
Under section 179 of the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended), holders of BSGA Ordinary
Shares will have the right to dissent from the Business Combination. Should a holder of BSGA Ordinary
Shares wish to exercise their appraisal right, they must give written notice of their objection to the Business
Combination to BSGA prior to the Special Meeting, or at the meeting but before the vote on the Business
Combination. Such notice must include a statement that the BSGA shareholder proposes to demand payment
for their shares if the Business Combination is undertaken.
Assuming that the Business Combination is approved, BSGA must give notice to any BSGA
shareholder who gave written notice of their objection to the Business Combination within 20 days of the
date of the Special Meeting at which the Business Combination is approved. Within 20 days following the
date of receipt of that notice, the dissenting shareholder must give notice to BSGA of their election to
dissent, which notice must include: (a) the shareholder’s name and address; (b) the number and class of
shares in respect of which they dissent (which must be all of the shares that the shareholder holds in BSGA);
and (c) a demand for payment of the fair value of the shares. Once such notice has been given to BSGA, the
dissenting shareholder ceases to have any rights as a shareholder of BSGA except for the right to be paid
the fair value of their shares.
Within seven days of the expiration of the 20-day period in which a BSGA shareholder may serve notice
of dissent (or seven days following the First SPAC Merger, whichever is the later), BSGA shall make a written
offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase their shares at a specified price that BSGA determine to be
their fair value. If, within 30 days of the date on which that offer is made, BSGA and the dissenting
shareholder agree upon the price to be paid for the shares, BSGA shall pay that amount to the shareholder
upon the surrender of the certificates representing their shares.
If agreement on the price to be paid for the shares cannot be reached, within 20 days of the expiration of
the 30-day period referred to above the following procedure shall be followed:
BSGA and the dissenting shareholder shall each designate an appraiser;
the two designated appraisers together shall designate an appraiser;
the three appraisers shall fix the fair value of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholder as of
the close of business on the day prior to the date on which the Business Combination was
approved, excluding any appreciation or depreciation directly or indirectly induced by the Business
Combination or its proposal, and that value is binding on BSGA and the dissenting shareholder for
all purposes; and
BSGA shall pay to the dissenting shareholder that amount in money, upon the surrender of the
certificates representing their shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Total Ordinary Shares Outstanding Upon Consummation of the Business Combination
The total number of ordinary shares to be issued and outstanding immediately following completion of
the Business Combination will be 112,869,011. We anticipate that the Bitdeer’s shareholders will hold 96.4%
of our outstanding ordinary shares, and the current BSGA Shareholders will hold 3.6% of our outstanding
ordinary shares, immediately following completion of the Business Combination. This percentage (i) assumes
that no public shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, (ii) does not take into
account any Bitdeer’s equity incentive award that are assumed by BTG in connection with the Business
Combination and will be outstanding immediately following the Business Combination, (iii) does not take
into account any equity awards that may be issued under the proposed BTG Incentive Plan following the
Business Combination, and (iv) does not take into account any Net Debt adjustments to the Merger
Consideration.
Anticipated Accounting Treatment
The Business Combination will be accounted for as a “reverse recapitalization” in accordance with
IFRS. Under this method of accounting, BSGA will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial
reporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business
Combination, the Bitdeer’s shareholders are expected to have a majority of the voting power of BTG, Bitdeer
will comprise all of the ongoing operations of combined company, Bitdeer will comprise a majority of the
governing body of combined company, and Bitdeer’s senior management will comprise all of the senior
management of combined company. Since BSGA does not meet the definition of a business under IFRS, the
transaction is outside the scope of IFRS 3, “Business Combinations”, and it is accounted for as an equity-
settled, share-based payment transaction in accordance with IFRS 2,“Share-based Payments”. Accordingly,
for accounting purposes, the Business Combination will be treated as the equivalent of Bitdeer issuing
shares for the net assets of BSGA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BSGA will be stated
at historical costs. Any difference in the fair value of the consideration deemed to have been issued by
Bitdeer and the fair value of BSGA’s identifiable net assets represents a listing service received by Bitdeer
and is recorded through profit and loss. No goodwill or other intangible assets will be recorded. Operations
prior to the Business Combination will be those of Bitdeer.
Redemption Rights
Pursuant to the Existing BSGA Articles, holders of Public Shares may elect to have their shares
redeemed for cash at the applicable redemption price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i)
the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of
the Business Combination, including interest (net of taxes payable), by (ii) the total number of then-
outstanding Public Shares. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, this would have amounted to
approximately US$10.87 per share.
You will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Shares to be redeemed only if you:
(a) hold Public Shares, or
(b) hold Public Shares through Units and you elect to separate your BSGA Units into the
underlying public shares prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the public
shares; and
prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 7, 2023, (a) submit a written request to Continental that
BSGA redeem your public shares for cash and (b) deliver your public shares to Continental,
physically or electronically through DTC.
Holders of outstanding BSGA Units must separate the underlying BSGA Ordinary Shares prior to
exercising Redemption Rights with respect to the Public Shares. If the BSGA Units are registered in a
holder’s own name, the holder must deliver the certificate for its BSGA Units to Continental, with written
instructions to separate the BSGA Units into their individual component parts. This must be completed far
enough in advance to permit the mailing of the certificates back to the holder so that the holder may then
exercise his, her or its redemption rights upon the separation of the public shares from the BSGA Units.
152 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a holder exercises its Redemption Rights, then such holder will be exchanging its Public Shares for
cash and will no longer own shares of BSGA. Such a holder will be entitled to receive cash for its Public
Shares only if it properly demands Redemption and delivers its shares (either physically or electronically) to
Continental in accordance with the procedures described herein. Please see the section entitled “The
Extraordinary General Meeting  -  Redemption Rights” for the procedures to be followed if you wish to
redeem your public shares for cash.

General
Holders of BSGA Ordinary Shares are being asked to authorize the Initial Mergers. Under the laws of the
British Virgin Islands, a statutory merger involving a BVI company (such as each of the Initial Mergers)
requires approval by such company’s shareholders. In light of the foregoing requirements and for good
governance practice, BSGA is seeking separate approval of the Initial Mergers by its shareholders in
addition to the approval of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby as set forth under
“The Business Combination Proposal” of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Resolutions to be Voted Upon
The full text of the resolutions to be proposed is as follows:
“RESOLVED, that the First SPAC Merger and the plan of merger for the First SPAC Merger (the “First
Plan of Merger”), a copy of which are attached to the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus as Annex
A-5 and any and all transactions contemplated thereunder, be approved and authorised in all respects;
RESOLVED, that upon the effective time of the First SPAC Merger, (i) the amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association in the form attached to the First Plan of Merger, a copy of which is
attached to the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A-6 be adopted as the new
memorandum and articles of association of BSGA (as the Initial SPAC Surviving Sub) in replacement of the
existing memorandum and articles of association of BSGA, and (ii) all authorised class A ordinary shares,
class B ordinary shares and preferred shares, each with no par value, of the Initial SPAC Surviving Sub be re-
designated as shares of a single class each with a par value of US$1.00 and the maximum number of shares
the Initial SPAC Surviving Sub is authorised to issue be decreased from 111,000,000 shares to 50,000 shares,
and as a consequence, the following wording shall be inserted as a new clause 6.2 of the memorandum of
association of the Initial SPAC Surviving Sub in place of the existing clause 5.1: “6.2. The Company is
authorised to issue a maximum of 50,000 Shares of a single class each with a par value of US$1.00.””

Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp_20230327_DEFM14A_20752338_4627890.Pdf,THE NASDAQ PROPOSAL,"THE NASDAQ PROPOSAL
Overview
BSGA is proposing the Nasdaq Proposal in order to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5635(a) and (b).
Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), shareholder approval is required prior to the issuance of securities in
connection with the acquisition of another company if such securities are not issued in a public offering and
(A) have, or will have upon issuance, voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power
outstanding before the issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common
stock); or (B) the number of shares of common stock to be issued is or will be equal to or in excess of 20% of
the number of shares of common stock outstanding before the issuance of the stock or securities. Under
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(b), shareholder approval is required prior to the issuance of securities when the
issuance or potential issuance will result in a change of control.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, based on Bitdeer’s and BSGA’s current capitalization, we anticipate
that we will issue to the Bitdeer’s shareholders as consideration in the Business Combination, 108,758,873
BTG Ordinary Shares. See the section entitled “The Business Combination Proposal - The Merger
Agreement - Merger Consideration.” Because the number of shares we anticipate issuing as consideration in
the Business Combination (1) will constitute more than 20% of BSGA’s outstanding shares and more than
20% of outstanding voting power prior to such issuance and (2) will result in a change of control of BSGA,
we are required to obtain shareholder approval of such issuance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules 5635(a)
and (b).
Effect of Proposal on Current Shareholders
If the Nasdaq Proposal is adopted, BTG would issue BTG Ordinary Shares representing more than 20%
of the outstanding ordinary shares in connection with the Business Combination. The issuance of such
securities would result in significant dilution to the BSGA Shareholders and would afford such shareholders
a smaller percentage interest in the voting power, liquidation value and aggregate book value of BSGA. If the
Nasdaq Proposal is adopted, assuming 108,758,873 ordinary shares are issued to the Bitdeer’s shareholders
as consideration in the Business Combination, we anticipate that the Bitdeer’s shareholders will hold 96.4%
of our outstanding ordinary shares, and the current BSGA Shareholders will hold 3.6% of our outstanding
ordinary shares immediately following completion of the Business Combination. This percentage assumes
that no ordinary shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, does not take into
account any warrants or options to purchase our ordinary shares that will be outstanding following the
Business Combination, or any equity awards that may be issued under our proposed Management Incentive
Plan following the Business Combination.
If the Nasdaq Proposal is not approved and we consummate the Business Combination on its current
terms, BSGA would be in violation of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), which could result in the delisting of our
securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we
could face significant material adverse consequences, including:
a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;
reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;
a determination that our shares are a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our
securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in
the secondary trading market for our securities;
a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the post-transaction company; and
a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
It is a condition to the obligations of BSGA and Bitdeer to close the Business Combination that BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, if the Nasdaq Proposal is not
adopted, the Business Combination may not be completed unless this condition is waived.
155 TABLE OF CONTENTS

The full text of the resolution to be passed is as follows:
“RESOLVED that the issuance of up to 112,869,011 ordinary shares in connection with the Business

This Nasdaq Proposal will be approved and adopted only if holders of at least a majority of the issued

General
If the Business Combination is consummated, the Existing BSGA Articles will effectively be replaced by
the Amended BTG Articles given holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will, effective as of the
consummation of the Business Combination (and assuming such holders do not redeem their BSGA Class A
Ordinary Shares) hold BTG Class A Ordinary Shares subject to the Amended BTG Articles.
BSGA Shareholders are asked to consider and vote upon and to approve four separate proposals
(collectively, the “Governing Documents Proposal”) in connection with the replacement of the Existing BSGA
Articles with the Amended BTG Articles. Each of the Business Combination Proposal, the Initial Mergers
Proposal and the four separate proposals in the Governing Documents Proposal are cross-conditioned on
the approval of each other. If any one of these proposals is not approved by BSGA Shareholders, the
Business Combination shall not be consummated.
The Amended BTG Articles differ materially from the Existing BSGA Articles. The following table sets
forth a summary of the material changes proposed between the Existing BSGA Articles and the Amended
BTG Articles that are included in the Governing Documents Proposal. This summary is qualified by reference
to the complete text of the Amended BTG Articles, attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B.
BSGA Shareholders are encouraged to read the Amended BTG Articles in their entirety for a more complete
description of their terms. Additionally, we encourage shareholders to carefully consult the information set
out under the “Comparison of Corporate Governance and Shareholder Rights” section of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

holder the right to one vote at a meeting of the
BSGA Shareholders or on any resolution of
Resolution of Members (as defined in the Existing
BSGA Articles).
Holders of Class A Ordinary Shares and Class V
Ordinary Shares shall at all times vote together as
one class on all resolutions. Each Class A Ordinary
Share shall entitle the holder thereof to one (1) vote
on all matters subject to vote at general meetings or
class meetings of BTG, and each Class V Ordinary
Share shall entitle the holder thereof to ten (10)
votes on all matters subject to vote at general
meetings or class meetings of BTG.

Resolutions to be Voted Upon
The full text of each of the resolutions to be proposed in respect of the four separate proposals within
the Governing Documents Proposal is as follows:
“RESOLVED to approve the replacement of the Existing BSGA Articles with the Amended BTG Articles.
RESOLVED to approve in all respect the effective change in authorized share capital from (i) the
maximum of 111,000,000 shares that BSGA is authorized to issue, with no par value, divided into three classes
of shares as follows: (a) 100,000,000 class A ordinary shares with no par value; (b) 10,000,000 class B
ordinary shares with no par value; and (c) 1,000,000 preferred shares with no par value, to (ii) the share

their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares) hold BTG Class A Ordinary Shares subject to the Amended BTG
Articles.
RESOLVED to approve in all respect, the effective change in voting power in respect of the BSGA Class
A Ordinary Shares given that, following the consummation of the Business Combination, each BTG Class A
Ordinary Share will be entitled to one (1) vote per share compared with each BTG Class V Ordinary Share
being entitled to ten (10) votes per share, which change will be effected given holders of BSGA Class A
Ordinary Shares will, effective as of the consummation of the Business Combination (and assuming such
holders do not redeem their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares) hold BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
RESOLVED to approve in all respect the effective change in the requirement of the number of directors
from (i) the minimum number of directors shall be one and there shall be no maximum number of directors to
(ii) unless otherwise determined by BTG in general meeting, the number of directors shall be no less than

THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS PROPOSAL A 
(AUTHORIZED SHARE CAPITAL)
Overview
Governing Documents Proposal A - to authorize the effective change in authorized share capital from (i) the
maximum of 111,000,000 shares that BSGA is authorized to issue, with no par value, divided into three classes
of shares as follows: (a) 100,000,000 class A ordinary shares with no par value; (b) 10,000,000 class B
ordinary shares with no par value; and (c) 1,000,000 preferred shares with no par value, to (ii) the share
capital of BTG of US$50,000 divided into 500,000,000,000 shares of a par value of US$0.0000001 each
comprising: 499,600,000,000 Class A Ordinary Shares of a par value of US$0.0000001 each, 200,000,000 Class
V Ordinary Shares of a par value of US$0.0000001 each, and 200,000,000 undesignated shares of a par value
of US$0.0000001 each, which change will be effected given holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will,
effective as of the consummation of the Business Combination (and assuming such holders do not redeem
their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares) hold BTG Class A Ordinary Shares subject to the Amended BTG
Articles.
Assuming the Business Combination Proposal is approved, BSGA Shareholders are also being asked to
approve Governing Documents Proposal A, which is, in the judgment of BSGA’s board of directors,
necessary to adequately address the needs of BTG after the Business Combination.
If Governing Documents Proposal A is approved, the share capital will be effectively changed as set
forth above.
This summary is qualified by reference to the complete text of the Amended BTG Articles, copies of
which are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. All BSGA Shareholders are encouraged
to read the Amended BTG Articles in their entirety for a more complete description of their terms.
Reasons for the Change
The purpose of this proposal is to provide for an authorized capital structure of BTG that will enable it
to have available for issuance a number of authorized shares of ordinary shares and preference shares
sufficient to support its growth and to provide flexibility for future corporate needs.
Votes Required for Approval
The Governing Documents Proposal A will be approved and adopted only if holders of at least a
majority of the issued and outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares present in person physically or by virtual
attendance or represented by proxy and entitled to vote and voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting vote
“FOR” the Governing Documents Proposal A. Neither a shareholder’s failure to vote during the

Overview
Governing Documents Proposal B - to authorize the effective change in voting power in respect of the
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares given that, following the consummation of the Business Combination each
BTG Class A Ordinary Share will be entitled to one (1) vote per share compared with each BTG Class V
Ordinary Share being entitled to ten (10) votes per share, which change will be effected given holders of
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will, effective as of the consummation of the Business Combination (and
assuming such holders do not redeem their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares) hold BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares.

approve Governing Documents Proposal B, which is, in the judgment of BSGA’s board of directors,
necessary to adequately address the needs of BTG after the Business Combination.
If Governing Documents Proposal B is approved, holders of shares of BTG Class V Ordinary Shares will
have ten (10) votes per share on each matter properly submitted to the shareholders entitled to vote whereas
holders of shares of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be entitled to one (1) vote per share.

Reasons for the Change
The purpose of this proposal is to ensure that the voting control that Bitdeer’s founder, Mr. Jihan Wu,
currently exercises with respect to Bitdeer continues with respect to BTG. Giving Mr. Jihan Wu this level of
voting control will allow him to execute BTG’s long-term strategy following the Business Combination.

less than three (3) and no more than twelve (12).
Assuming the Business Combination Proposal is approved, BSGA Shareholders are also being asked to

States.

THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS PROPOSAL D 
(OTHER PROVISIONS INCLUDING STATUS AS A BLANK CHECK COMPANY)
Overview
Governing Documents Proposal D - to authorize all other changes in connection with the effective
replacement of the Existing BSGA Articles with the Amended BTG Articles effective as of the consummation
of the Business Combination, including changing the name from BSGA to BTG, and removing certain
provisions relating to BSGA’s status as a blank check company that will no longer be applicable to BTG
following consummation of the Business Combination, which changes will be effected given holders of
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will, effective as of the consummation of the Business Combination (and
assuming such holders do not redeem their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares), hold BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares subject to the Amended BTG Articles.
Assuming the Business Combination Proposal is approved, BSGA Shareholders are also being asked to
approve Governing Documents Proposal D, which is, in the judgment of BSGA’s board of directors,
necessary to adequately address the needs of BTG after the Business Combination.
The Amended BTG Articles will not contain provisions related to a blank check company (including
those related to the operation of the trust account, winding up of BSGA’s operations should BSGA not
complete a business combination by a specified date, and other such blank check-specific provisions as are
present in the Existing BSGA Articles) because following the consummation of the Business Combination,
BTG will not be a blank check company.
Approval of each of the four separate proposals constituting the Governing Documents Proposal,
assuming approval of the Business Combination Proposal, will result, upon the closing of the Business
Combination, in the wholesale replacement of the Existing BSGA Articles with the Amended BTG Articles.
While certain material changes between the Existing BSGA Articles and the Amended BTG Articles have
been unbundled into distinct Governing Documents Proposals or otherwise identified in this Governing
Documents Proposal D, there are other differences between the Existing BSGA Articles and Amended BTG
Articles that will be approved (subject to the approval of the aforementioned related proposals and
consummation of the Business Combination) if BSGA Shareholders approve this Governing Documents
Proposal D. Accordingly, we encourage BSGA Shareholders to carefully review the terms of the Amended
BTG Articles, attached hereto as Annex B, as well as the information provided in the “Comparison of
Corporate Governance and Shareholder Rights” section of this proxy statement/prospectus.
This summary is qualified by reference to the complete text of the Amended BTG Articles, copies of
which are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. All BSGA Shareholders are encouraged
to read the Amended BTG Articles in their entirety for a more complete description of their terms.
Reasons for the Change
The BTG board of directors believes that changing the post-business combination corporate name from
“Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp.” to “Bitdeer Technologies Group” is desirable to reflect the Business
Combination with Bitdeer and to clearly identify BTG as the publicly traded entity.
The elimination of certain provisions related to BSGA’s status as a blank check company is desirable
because these provisions will serve no purpose following the Business Combination. For example, the
Amended BTG Articles do not include the requirement to dissolve BTG upon failure to consummate a
business combination in accordance with its terms, and allow BTG to continue as a corporate entity
following the Business Combination. In addition, certain other provisions in BSGA’s current certificate
require that proceeds from BSGA’s initial public offering be held in the trust account until a business
combination or liquidation of BSGA has occurred. These provisions cease to apply once the Business
Combination is consummated and are therefore not included in the Amended BTG Articles.
Votes Required for Approval
The Governing Documents Proposal D will be approved and adopted only if holders of at least a
majority of the issued and outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares present in person physically or by virtual
attendance or

represented by proxy and entitled to vote and voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting vote “FOR” the

Governance Documents Proposal D will have no effect even if approved by BSGA Shareholders.

General
The holders of BSGA Ordinary Shares are being asked to approve the BTG Incentive Plan. The BSGA
Board intends to adopt the BTG Incentive Plan, subject to approval from the holders of BSGA Ordinary
Shares. If approved, the BTG Incentive Plan will become effective upon the Closing and will be used by BTG
following the Closing.
The BSGA Board believes that BTG must offer a competitive equity incentive program if it is to
successfully attract and retain the best possible candidates for positions of substantial responsibility within
BTG. The BSGA Board expects that the BTG Incentive Plan will be an important factor in attracting, retaining
and rewarding high caliber employees who are essential to BTG’s success and in providing incentive to
these individuals to promote the success of BTG.
Summary of the BTG Incentive Plan
The following summary is not a complete statement of the BTG Incentive Plan and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the BTG Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus.
Shares Available for Awards
Subject to adjustment for specified changes in BTG’s capitalization as set forth in the BTG Incentive
Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of common share that may be issued under the BTG Incentive
Plan will be equal to the product of (i) 2,548,933,157, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the
Merger Agreement).
The following shares of common shares will become available again for the grant of a share award under
the BTG Incentive Plan: (i) any share issued pursuant to a share award that terminates, expires, or lapses for
any reason; (ii) any share delivered by the participant or withheld by BTG upon the exercise of any award
under the BTG Inventive Plan, in payment of the exercise price thereof or tax withholding thereon; and (iii)
any share issued pursuant to a share award that is forfeited by the participant or repurchased by BTG.
Administration
The BTG Incentive Plan will be administered by a Committee of one or more members of the Board to
whom the Board shall delegate the authority to grant or amend awards to participants other than any of the
Committee members. Subject to the terms of the BTG Incentive Plan, the Committee has full and final power
and authority to make all decisions and determinations that may be required pursuant to the BTG Incentive
Plan or as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to administer the BTG Incentive Plan, including:
determine participants to receive awards; the type and number of awards to be granted; the terms and
conditions of any award granted pursuant to the BTG Incentive Plan, including, but not limited to, the
exercise price, grant price, or purchase price, any restrictions or limitations on the award, any schedule for
lapse of forfeiture restrictions or restrictions on the exercisability of an award, and accelerations or waivers
thereof, any provisions related to non-competition and recapture of gain on an award; prescribe the form of
each notice of grant; and correct any defect, supply any omission and reconcile any inconsistency in the
BTG Incentive Plan. The Committee also has the authority to reduce the exercise price per share underlying
an option, and establish, adopt, waive, or revise any rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or
advisable to administer the BTG Incentive Plan.
Types of Awards
The terms of the BTG Incentive Plan provide for the grant of share options, restricted share units, and
restricted shares.
Options. The Committee will be authorized to grant options to purchase shares of common share that
are either “qualified,” meaning they are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code for
incentive share options (“ISOs”), or “nonqualified,” meaning they are not intended to satisfy the
requirements
165 • 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Section 422 of the Code. Options granted under the BTG Incentive Plan will be subject to terms, including
the exercise price and the conditions and timing of exercise, determined by the Committee and specified in
the applicable award agreement. In general, the exercise price per share of common share for each non-
qualified share option (“NSO”) granted under the BTG Incentive Plan will be a fixed or variable price related
to the fair market value. The exercise price per share of common share for each ISO granted under the BTG
Incentive Plan will be equal to the fair market value (or 110% of the fair market value, in the case of ISOs
granted to a more than 10% shareholder) of the share at the time of grant. The maximum term of an option
granted under the Incentive Plan will be ten years from the date of grant. Payment in respect of the exercise
of an option may be made in cash or by check, or the Committee may, in its discretion and to the extent
permitted by law, allow the payment to be made through a broker-assisted cashless exercise mechanism, a
share tender exercise, or by any other method that the Committee determines to be appropriate.
Restricted Share Awards. The Committee will be authorized to award restricted shares under the BTG
Incentive Plan. Each award of restricted share will be subject to the terms and conditions established by the
Committee, including any dividend or voting rights. Restricted share awards are shares of common share that
generally are non-transferable and subject to other restrictions determined by the Committee for a specified
period. Unless the Committee determines otherwise or specifies otherwise in an award agreement, if the
participant terminates employment or services during the restricted period, then any unvested restricted
share is forfeited.
Restricted Share Units. The Committee will be authorized to award restricted share unit awards under
the BTG Incentive Plan. The Committee will determine the terms of the restricted share units, including any
dividend rights (and any performance goals and/or criteria upon whose attainment the restricted period shall
lapse in part or full). Unless the Committee determines otherwise or specifies otherwise in an award
agreement, if the participant terminates employment or services during the period of time over which all or a
portion of the units are to be earned, then any unvested units will be forfeited.
Plan Amendment or Termination.
With the approval of the Board, at any time and from time to time, the Committee has the authority to
terminate, amend, modify, alter, suspend, or discontinue the BTG Incentive Plan or any portion thereof.
Eligibility
Persons eligible to participate in the BTG Incentive Plan include persons recognized by the Committee,
e.g., directors, employees and consultants, as determined by the Committee.
Terms and Conditions of Awards
All Awards
Generally, the Committee will determine the terms of all awards under the BTG Incentive Plan, including
the vesting and acceleration of vesting of awards, provisions for the withholding of taxes, and payment of
amounts in lieu of cash dividends or other cash distributions with respect to BTG’s common share subject to
awards.
Awards Requiring Exercise
Incentive share options and, except as provided in the award agreement, nonqualified share options,
may not be transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and during an employee’s
lifetime may be exercised only by the employee or the employee’s guardian or legal representative. Upon the
cessation of a participant’s employment with BTG, an award requiring exercise will cease to be exercisable
and will terminate and all other unvested awards will be forfeited, except that:
All share options held by the participant which were exercisable immediately prior to the participant’s
termination of service with BTG other than for Cause (as defined in the BTG Incentive Plan) will,
except as otherwise set forth in the option award agreement, remain exercisable until the tenth
anniversary of the grant date to the extent that such options were vested and exercisable on the date
of the participant’s termination of employment or service;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
All share options held by the participant which were exercisable immediately prior to the participant’s
termination of service with BTG due to death or disability will remain exercisable until the tenth
anniversary of the grant date to the extent that such options were vested and exercisable on the date
of the participant’s termination of employment on account of death or disability
The exercise price of each award requiring exercise will be determined by the Committee and set forth in
the Notice of Grant which may be a fixed or variable price related to the Fair Market Value of the Shares;
provided that the exercise price of incentive share options shall be equal to the Fair Market Value on the date
of grant; and incentive share options granted to participants who own share of BTG possessing more than
10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of share of BTG or any parent corporation, subsidiary
corporation or affiliate of BTG (a “Ten Percent Holder”) must have an exercise price per share not less than
110% of the fair market value of a share of common share on the effective date the incentive share option is
granted. Fair market value will be determined by the Committee consistent with the applicable requirements
of Section 409A of the Code.
Awards requiring exercise will have a maximum term not to exceed ten years from the date of grant.
Effect of a Change in Capital Structure
In the event of a change in capital structure, the Committee may make such proportionate and equitable
adjustments as it may deem appropriate to reflect such change with respect to (a) the aggregate number and
type of shares that may be issued under the BTG Incentive Plan; (b) the terms and conditions of any issued
and outstanding awards (including, without limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with
respect thereto); and (c) the grant or exercise price per share for any issued and outstanding awards under
the BTG Incentive Plan.
Number of Awards Granted to Employees, Consultants and Directors
As of the date hereof, no awards have been granted under the BTG Incentive Plan.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following are material U.S. federal income tax consequences of (i) the Business Combination
generally applicable to U.S. Holders (defined below) of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares and BSGA Rights
(together, “BSGA Securities”) or Bitdeer Shares, (ii) the subsequent ownership and disposition of BTG Class
A Ordinary Shares received by such holders in the Business Combination and (iii) the exercise of redemption
rights by U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares.
This summary is limited to U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to U.S. Holders that hold
BSGA Securities or Bitdeer Shares and, after the completion of the Business Combination, will hold BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares, as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not
address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their
individual circumstances or status, including:
our Sponsor or any member thereof;
banks or financial institutions;
dealers or electing traders in securities that are subject to mark-to-market tax accounting rules;
tax-exempt entities (including private foundations);
insurance companies;
regulated investment companies;
real estate investment trusts;
pension plans;
cooperatives;
government organizations;
partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and investors therein);
certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;
persons that acquired BSGA Securities or Bitdeer Shares as compensation;
persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more of the shares of BSGA, Bitdeer, or,
following the Business Combination, BTG, by vote or value;
persons that hold BSGA Securities or Bitdeer Shares, or will hold BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, in
connection with a trade or business, permanent establishment, or fixed place of business conducted
outside the United States;
persons that hold BSGA Securities or Bitdeer Shares, or will hold BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, as
part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction; or
U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
If a partnership (or any entity so characterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Bitdeer
Shares, BSGA Securities or BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, the tax treatment of such partnership and its
partners will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership.
Partnerships holding any Bitdeer Shares, BSGA Securities or BTG Class A Ordinary Shares and their partners
should consult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business
Combination, ownership and disposition of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, or the exercise of redemption
rights with respect to the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares.
This discussion is based on the Code, proposed, temporary and final Treasury regulations promulgated
under the Code, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. All of the
169 • 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
foregoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax
considerations described herein. This discussion does not address alternative minimum or Medicare
contribution tax considerations, the special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code or U.S.
federal taxes other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income taxation (such as estate or gift taxes), nor
does it address any aspects of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxation.
We have not and do not intend to seek any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
regarding any aspect of the Business Combination or the exercise of redemption rights. There can be no
assurance that the IRS will not take positions that are inconsistent with those discussed below or that any
such positions would not be sustained by a court.
As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a person that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a
beneficial owner of BSGA Securities, Bitdeer Shares, or BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received pursuant to
the Business Combination and is:
a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or
an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source.
THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF
ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION.
HOLDERS OF BSGA SECURITIES OR BITDEER SHARES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS
REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION
AND OF THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF BTG CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES AFTER THE
BUSINESS COMBINATION, OR THE REDEMPTION OF THEIR BSGA CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES,
INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX
LAWS.
Consequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of BSGA Securities
Subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations set forth in this section entitled “-
Consequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of BSGA Securities,” in the opinion of Davis
Polk & Wardwell LLP, the following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business
Combination to U.S. Holders of BSGA Securities. As used in this section entitled “-Consequences of the
Business Combination to U.S. Holders of BSGA Securities,” the term “U.S. Holder” means a U.S. Holder of
BSGA Securities.
Separation of a BSGA Unit
No statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of an instrument such
as a Unit for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. The
separation of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Share and BSGA Right comprising a BSGA Unit should not be a
taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because there are no authorities that directly
address instruments that are similar to the BSGA Units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court will
agree with the characterization described above.
Conversion of a BSGA Right into BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares
No statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of instruments similar
to the BSGA Rights for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear.
While we believe that a U.S. Holder of BSGA Rights should not be required to recognize gain or loss upon
the receipt of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the conversion of the BSGA Rights, no assurance
can be given that the IRS or a court will agree with this treatment. If this treatment is respected, the tax basis
of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares acquired by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the terms of the BSGA Rights
should be equal to the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the relevant ten BSGA Rights with respect to which the
share was issued. The holding period of such BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares should begin on the day after
the
170

TABLE OF CONTENTS
conversion of the BSGA Rights into such BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares. U.S. Holders of BSGA Rights that
do not receive BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares with respect thereto (because they hold fewer than ten BSGA
Rights) should consult their tax advisers regarding their ability to claim a loss with respect to such non-
converted BSGA Rights.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term “BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares,” as used in the
remainder of this discussion, includes any BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares a U.S. Holder receives upon the
conversion of such holder’s BSGA Rights in connection with the consummation of the Business
Combination.
Qualification of the Initial Mergers as a Reorganization
The Initial Mergers should be treated as a “reorganization” described in Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code
(an “F Reorganization”). However, there is no assurance that the IRS or any court will agree with this
position. U.S. Holders should be aware that the completion of the Business Combination is not conditioned
on the receipt of an opinion of counsel that the Initial Mergers (or any other aspect of the Business
Combination) qualify as tax-free transactions. Neither BSGA nor BTG has requested or will request a ruling
from the IRS with respect to any aspect of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination.
Assuming that the Initial Mergers qualify as an F Reorganization:
a U.S. Holder that exchanges its BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Initial Mergers
generally will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange of such BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares for
BTG Class A Ordinary Shares,
the adjusted tax basis of a U.S. Holder in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received as a result of the
Initial Mergers will equal the adjusted tax basis of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor, and
a U.S. Holder’s holding period in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the exchange will include
the holding period in the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.
The exchange of BSGA Rights for BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, which in turn are exchanged for BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares, should also be a tax-free transaction to U.S. Holders of BSGA Rights, but it is
possible that the IRS could take the position that such transactions are taxable to holders of BSGA Rights,
even if the Initial Mergers qualify as an F Reorganization with respect to U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A
Ordinary Shares.
If the Initial Mergers do not qualify as an F Reorganization, the tax consequences of the Initial Mergers
will depend on whether the Initial Mergers or any component thereof would qualify for tax-free treatment
under other provisions of the Code, and may be affected by BSGA’s PFIC status and whether BTG is also a
PFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the Initial Mergers if they do not qualify as an F Reorganization or otherwise as tax-free transactions
(including the requirement to recognize gain in that event). In addition, U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisers regarding whether the PFIC rules could apply to the transfer of their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares
pursuant to the Initial Mergers if they do not qualify as an F Reorganization (regardless of whether the Initial
Mergers otherwise qualify for tax-free treatment).
Because the Initial Mergers will occur prior to the redemption of U.S. Holders that exercise redemption
rights, U.S. Holders exercising such redemption rights will be subject to the potential tax consequences of
the Initial Mergers described above, and the PFIC rules described below will apply to any income or gain or
recognized with respect to the redemption. All U.S. Holders considering exercising redemption rights are
urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the potential tax consequences to them of the Initial
Mergers and an exercise of redemption rights.
The remainder of this disclosure assumes the Initial Mergers qualify as an F Reorganization.
Effect of the Acquisition Merger
The implementation of the subsequent Acquisition Merger should not have an adverse effect on the
U.S. federal income tax treatment of the exchange of BSGA Securities by U.S. Holders and accordingly, the
Business Combination as a whole should be a nontaxable transaction to them for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

Consequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of Bitdeer Shares
Subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations set forth in this section entitled “-
Consequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of Bitdeer Shares,” the following are the material
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of Bitdeer Shares. As
used in this section entitled “-Consequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of Bitdeer
Shares,” the term “U.S. Holder” means a U.S. Holder of Bitdeer Shares.
Qualification of the Acquisition Merger as a Reorganization
The Acquisition Merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” described in Section 368(a) of the
Code (a “Reorganization”). In connection with the effectiveness of this registration statement of which this
proxy statement/prospectus is a part, Cooley LLP, counsel to Bitdeer, will issue an opinion to Bitdeer that the
Acquisition Merger should qualify as a Reorganization (the “Cooley opinion”). The Cooley opinion is
prospective, dependent on future events, and based on customary assumptions and representations from
Bitdeer, BSGA, and BTG, as well as certain covenants and undertakings by Bitdeer, BSGA, BTG, and their
respective affiliates (together, the “tax opinion representations and assumptions”). If any of the tax opinion
representations and assumptions are incorrect, incomplete, or inaccurate, or are violated, the validity of the
Cooley opinion may be affected, and the tax consequences of the Acquisition Merger could differ from those
described herein. An opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment, but it is not binding on
the IRS or any court and there is no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the Acquisition Merger’s
qualification as a Reorganization or that a court will not sustain such a challenge. U.S. Holders should be
aware that the completion of the Business Combination is not conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of
counsel that the Acquisition Merger (or any other aspect of the Business Combination) qualifies as a tax-free
transaction. Further, Bitdeer has not requested, and will not request, a ruling from the IRS with respect to
any aspect of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination.
Assuming that the Acquisition Merger qualifies as a Reorganization:
a U.S. Holder that exchanges its Bitdeer Shares pursuant to the Business Combination generally will
not recognize gain or loss on the exchange of such Bitdeer Shares for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares,
the adjusted tax basis of a U.S. Holder in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received as a result of the
Business Combination generally will equal the adjusted tax basis of the Bitdeer Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor, and
a U.S. Holder’s holding period in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the exchange generally will
include the holding period in the Bitdeer Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.
If the Acquisition Merger does not qualify as a Reorganization or any other tax-free transaction under
the Code, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the fair
market value of the amount realized in the Acquisition Merger and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Bitdeer Shares exchanged therefor. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the Bitdeer Shares exceeds one year at
the time of the Acquisition Merger. Long-term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. Holders currently are
eligible for preferential tax rates, while the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. The U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the Acquisition Merger generally
will be equal to their fair market value at the time of the Acquisition Merger, and the U.S. Holder’s holding
period in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the Acquisition Merger generally will commence on
the day following the Acquisition Merger. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Acquisition Merger if it does not qualify as a Reorganization or any
other tax-free transaction under the Code (including the requirement to recognize gain in that event). In
addition, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding whether the PFIC rules could apply to the
transfer of their Bitdeer Shares pursuant to the Acquisition Merger if it does not qualify as a Reorganization
(regardless of whether the Acquisition Merger otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment).
Consequences of Ownership and Disposition of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares
Taxation of Distributions
The following discussion is subject to the discussion below under “ - Passive Foreign Investment
Company Rules.”
172 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
A U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as dividend income the amount of
any distribution paid on BTG Class A Ordinary Shares to the extent the distribution is paid out of BTG’s
current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles) on the
day actually or constructively received by the U.S. Holder. Because BTG may not maintain calculations of
earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that the full amount of
distributions (if any) paid by BTG will be reported as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Dividends received on BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will not be eligible for the dividends received
deduction generally allowed to corporations. Dividends received by certain other non-corporate U.S.
Holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to tax at the lower capital gain tax rate currently
applicable to “qualified dividend income,” provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including that BTG
is not a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding year and certain holding
period and other requirements are met. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the BSGA
Class A Ordinary Shares may prevent the holding period from commencing prior to the termination of such
rights. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the availability of such lower rate on
dividends generally and in their particular circumstances.
Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares
The following discussion is subject to the discussion below under “ - Passive Foreign Investment
Company Rules.”
A U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of
BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the
disposition and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, each determined
in U.S. dollars. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
Holder’s holding period for such BTG Class A Ordinary Shares exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain
realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder is currently eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deduction of
capital losses is subject to certain limitations.
Consequences of a Redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares
The following discussion is subject to the discussion below under “ - Passive Foreign Investment
Company Rules.”
In the event that a U.S. Holder’s BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares are redeemed pursuant to the
redemption provisions described in this proxy statement/prospectus under “Extraordinary General Meeting
of BSGA Shareholders - Redemption Rights,” the treatment of the redemption for U.S. federal income tax
purposes will generally depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the BSGA Class A Ordinary
Shares under Section 302 of the Code (in which case such redemption would be treated as described above
under the heading “ - Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares”) or rather as a distribution, in which case such redemption would be treated as described in
“ - Taxation of Distributions”  (except that the preferential rate for qualified dividend income will not apply).
Generally, whether a redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares treated as held by the U.S. Holder (including any shares constructively
owned by the U.S. Holder described in the following paragraph) relative to all BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares
outstanding both before and after such redemption (and treating BTG Class A Ordinary Shares as BSGA
Class A Ordinary Shares for this purpose). The redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares generally will
be treated as a sale of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares (rather than as a corporate distribution) if such
redemption (i) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. Holder, (ii) results in a “complete
termination” of the U.S. Holder’s interest in us or (iii) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with
respect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.
In determining whether any of the tests are satisfied, a U.S. Holder generally takes into account not only
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also any BSGA Class A Ordinary
Shares that are constructively owned by such U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in
addition to shares owned directly, shares owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S.
Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any shares the U.S. Holder has
a right to
173 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
acquire by exercise of an option. In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of
our outstanding voting shares (including the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares and the BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares received in exchange therefor) actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately
following the redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares must, among other requirements, be less than
80% of the percentage of our outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S.
Holder immediately before the redemption. Before the Business Combination, the BSGA Class A Ordinary
Shares may not be treated as voting shares for this purpose and, consequently, this substantially
disproportionate test may not be applicable. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder’s interest if
either (i) all BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are
redeemed or (ii) all BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed and the
U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of
shares owned by certain family members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other shares
of ours. The redemption of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will not be essentially equivalent to a
dividend with respect to a U.S. Holder if it results in a “meaningful reduction” of the U.S. Holder’s
proportionate interest in BSGA. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S.
Holder’s proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS
has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small
minority shareholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may
constitute such a “meaningful reduction.”
If none of the foregoing tests is satisfied, then the redemption will be treated as a corporate distribution
and taxed in the manner described above under “ - Taxation of Distributions”  (except that the preferential
rate for qualified dividend income will not apply). After the application of those rules, any remaining tax
basis of the U.S. Holder in the redeemed BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will be added to the U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in its remaining shares, or, if it has none, to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in other
shares constructively owned by such U.S. Holder.
Any income or gain recognized with respect to the redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will be
subject to the PFIC rules described below.
U.S. HOLDERS OF BSGA CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES CONTEMPLATING THE EXERCISE OF THEIR
REDEMPTION RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL,
STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES THEREOF.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
The treatment of U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares and BTG Class A Ordinary Shares
could be (and generally will be, in the case of U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares) materially
different from that described above due to the application of the PFIC rules.
In general, a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in
which (i) 50% or more of the value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a weighted quarterly
average) consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income, or (ii) 75% or
more of its gross income consists of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest,
royalties, rents, investment gains, net gains from the sales of property that does not give rise to any income
and net gains from the sale of commodities (subject to certain exceptions, such as an exception for certain
income derived in the active conduct of a trade or business). Cash and cash equivalents are, and
cryptocurrency balances are likely, passive assets. The value of goodwill will generally be treated as an
active or passive asset based on the nature of the income produced in the activity to which the goodwill is
attributable. For purposes of the PFIC rules, a non-U.S. corporation that owns, directly or indirectly, at least
25% by value of the stock of another corporation is treated as if it held its proportionate share of the assets
of the other corporation, and received directly its proportionate share of the income of the other corporation.
Pursuant to the start-up exception, a corporation will not be a PFIC for the first taxable year the
corporation has gross income (the “start-up year”), if (1) no predecessor of the corporation was a PFIC, (2) it
is established to the satisfaction of the IRS that the corporation will not be a PFIC for either of the first two
taxable years following the start-up year, and (3) the corporation is not in fact a PFIC for either of those years
(the “start-up exception”). BSGA believes that it did not qualify for the start-up exception for its taxable year
ended December 31, 2021. Therefore, because BSGA is a blank-check company with no current active
174 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
business, based on the composition of BSGA’s income and assets, BSGA believes that it was a PFIC for its
taxable years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.
Furthermore, the PFIC status of BSGA may affect the PFIC status of BTG for BTG’s taxable year ending
December 31, 2023 because BTG should be treated as the same corporation as BSGA for purposes of the
PFIC rules. Depending on the closing date of the Business Combination and the composition of BTG’s
income and assets and the estimated value of BTG’s assets, including goodwill, BTG may be a PFIC for its
taxable year ending December 31, 2023. BTG’s PFIC status for any taxable year is a factual annual
determination that can be made only after the end of that year and will depend on the composition of BTG’s
income and assets and the value of its assets from time to time (including the value of its goodwill, which
may be determined in large part by reference to the market price of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares from
time to time, which could be volatile) and, for the taxable year in which the Business Combination occurs, the
income and assets, and the value of the assets, of its predecessor BSGA. In addition, the risk of BTG being a
PFIC for any taxable year will increase if its market capitalization declines substantially during that year.
Furthermore, whether and to which extent BTG’s income and assets, including goodwill, will be characterized
as active or passive will depend on various factors that are subject to uncertainty, including BTG’s future
business plan and the application of laws that are subject to varying interpretation. For example, there is no
authority that directly addresses the proper treatment of certain items of BTG’s income, such as income from
proprietary cryptocurrency mining, hash rate sharing, or hosting for purposes of the PFIC rules and,
although BTG currently treats these items of income as active, such treatment is uncertain. Moreover, certain
of BTG’s business activities generate passive income and, although the amount of such income is currently
small, BTG’s risk of being a PFIC will increase if the proportion of BTG’s revenue earned from such business
activities increases in future taxable years. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that BTG will not be a
PFIC for its current or any future taxable year.
Even if BTG is not a PFIC for its taxable year ending December 31, 2023, or any subsequent taxable year,
if BSGA is or was a PFIC (as BSGA believes to be the case for its 2021 and 2022 taxable years, and which may
be the case for its 2023 taxable year) for any taxable year during the holding period of a U.S. Holder in its
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, and such U.S. Holder did not (or could not) make any of the PFIC Elections
(as defined below), although not free from doubt, BTG would be treated as a PFIC as to a U.S. Holder who
exchanges BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in connection with the Initial
Mergers with respect to such BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, unless such U.S. Holder makes a purging
election with respect to its shares. Under one type of purging election, the U.S. Holder will be deemed to
have sold such shares at their fair market value and any gain recognized on such deemed sale will be treated
as an “excess distribution,” as described below. As a result of this election, the U.S. Holder will have
additional basis (to the extent of any gain recognized in the deemed sale) and, solely for purposes of the
PFIC rules, a new holding period in such holder’s BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. In the absence of a purging
election, such U.S. Holder would be treated for purposes of the PFIC rules as if it held such BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares for a period that includes its holding period for the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares
exchanged therefor. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the
purging elections rules to their particular circumstances.
In addition, any income or gain recognized by a U.S. Holder electing to have its BSGA Class A Ordinary
Shares redeemed, as described above under the heading “ - Consequences of Ownership and Disposition of
BTG Class A Ordinary Shares - Consequences of a Redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares,” would
generally be subject to a special tax and interest charge if such U.S. Holder did not make a qualified electing
fund (“QEF”) election for BSGA’s first taxable year as a PFIC in which such U.S. Holder held (or was deemed
to hold) such shares, a QEF election along with an applicable purging election, or a mark-to-market election
(collectively, the “PFIC Elections”).
If BTG is a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owns BTG Class A Ordinary Shares and
any entity in which it owns equity interests is also a PFIC (a “Lower-tier PFIC”), the U.S. Holder will be
deemed to own their proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of each Lower-tier PFIC and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax according to the rules described above on (i) certain distributions by a
Lower-tier PFIC and (ii) dispositions of shares of Lower-tier PFICs, in each case as if the U.S. Holders held
such shares directly, even though the U.S. Holders will not receive any proceeds of those distributions or
dispositions.
175 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If BSGA or BTG is a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period
of a U.S. Holder of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on a sale or other
disposition (including certain pledges) of its BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be allocated ratably over the
U.S. Holder’s holding period for such BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. The amounts allocated to the taxable
year of the sale or disposition and to any year before BTG became a PFIC will be taxed as ordinary income.
The amount allocated to each other taxable year will be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for
individuals or corporations, as applicable, for that taxable year, and an interest charge will be imposed on the
resulting tax liability for each such year. Furthermore, to the extent that distributions received by a U.S.
Holder in any taxable year on its BTG Class A Ordinary Shares exceed 125% of the average of the annual
distributions on the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received during the preceding three taxable years or the
U.S. Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter, the excess distributions will be subject to taxation in the
same manner.
In general, a U.S. Holder of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares may avoid the adverse PFIC tax
consequences described above in respect of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares if it has made and maintains a
timely and valid QEF election to include in income its pro rata share of BSGA’s (and its successor BTG’s) net
capital gains (as long-term capital gains) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current
basis, in each case, whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which
BSGA’s (or its successor BTG’s) taxable year ends. In order to comply with the requirements of a QEF
election, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC Annual Information Statement from BSGA or BTG, as the case
may be. BSGA will endeavor to make available to U.S. Holders a PFIC Annual Information Statement, upon
request, with respect to its taxable year ended December 31, 2022. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder of
BSGA Rights is entitled to make a QEF election with respect to the BSGA Rights. Under proposed Treasury
regulations, for purposes of the PFIC rules, the holding period of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares received
with respect to BSGA Rights (and the holding period of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received with respect
thereto) could include the holding period for the Rights. Therefore, assuming a QEF election is not available
with respect to the BSGA Rights, a U.S. Holder of BSGA Rights may be subject to the general PFIC rules
described in the preceding paragraph with respect to the shares underlying the BSGA Rights, even if the U.S.
Holder made a QEF election with respect to its other BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, unless a purging
election is made. U.S. Holders of BSGA Rights should consult their tax advisers regarding whether and how
the PFIC rules apply to their BSGA Rights or the underlying BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares.
Alternatively, if a U.S. Holder owns shares in a company that is a PFIC and the shares are “regularly
traded” on a “qualified exchange,” such U.S. Holder could make a mark-to-market election that would result
in tax treatment different from the general tax treatment for PFICs described above. The BSGA Class A
Ordinary Shares and BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be treated as regularly traded for any calendar year in
which more than a de minimis quantity of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares or BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares, as applicable, are traded on a qualified exchange on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter.
Nasdaq, where the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares are listed and the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares are
expected to be listed, is a qualified exchange for this purpose. If a U.S. Holder makes (or has made) the mark-
to-market election for the first taxable year of BSGA or BTG in which it is or was treated as a PFIC with
respect to such U.S. Holder, the U.S. Holder generally will recognize as ordinary income any excess of the fair
market value of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares at the end of each taxable year over their adjusted tax
basis, and will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of any excess of the adjusted tax basis of the BTG Class
A Ordinary Shares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net
amount of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. Holder makes the
mark-to-market election, the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be adjusted to
reflect the income or loss amounts recognized. Any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares in a year in which BTG is a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will
be treated as an ordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a
result of the mark-to-market election, with any excess treated as capital loss). If a U.S. Holder makes the
mark-to-market election, distributions paid on BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be treated as discussed
under “ - Taxation of Distributions” above. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the
availability and advisability of making a mark-to-market election in their particular circumstances. U.S.
Holders should note that there is no provision in the Code, Treasury regulations or other official IRS
guidance that would give them the right to make a mark-to-market election with respect to any Lower-tier
PFIC, the shares of which are not regularly traded, and, therefore, the general rules applicable to ownership
of a PFIC
176 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
described above could continue to apply to a U.S. Holder with respect to any Lower-tier PFIC of BTG, even if
the U.S. Holder made a mark-to-market election with respect to the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
If BTG is (or is treated with respect to a particular U.S. Holder as) a PFIC for any taxable year during
which a U.S. Holder owns any BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in
applicable Treasury regulations, the U.S. Holder will be required to file annual reports with the IRS with
respect to BTG and any Lower-tier PFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the
determination of whether BSGA or BTG is a PFIC for any taxable year and the potential application of the
PFIC rules to their ownership of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
U.S. Holders that exchange their Bitdeer Shares for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the
Business Combination are required to retain permanent records pertaining to the Acquisition Merger and
make such records available to any authorized IRS officers and employees. Additionally, such U.S. Holders
that, immediately before the completion of the Acquisition Merger, own at least 1% (by vote or value) of
Bitdeer capital stock or, in certain instances, Bitdeer “securities” with a basis of at least US$1 million are
required to attach a statement to their U.S. federal income tax returns for the taxable year in which the
Acquisition Merger is completed containing certain information prescribed by applicable Treasury
regulations.
Payments of dividends and sales (including redemption) proceeds that are made within the United
States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting and
backup withholding, unless (i) the U.S. Holder is a corporation or other “exempt recipient” or (ii) in the case
of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it
is not subject to backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a
U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a
refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain U.S. Holders who are
individuals (and certain specified entities) may be required to report information relating to their ownership
of BSGA Securities, Bitdeer Shares or BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, or non-U.S. accounts through which
they are held.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to their
BSGA Securities, Bitdeer Shares and BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
British Virgin Islands Tax Considerations
Under the BVI Companies Act, BSGA is exempt from all forms of BVI taxes; all dividends, interest,
royalties and other amounts payable by BSGA, and any gain realized on any shares, debt obligations or
other securities of BSGA, are exempt from BVI taxes; and no BVI estate, inheritance, succession or gift taxes
are payable with respect to any shares, debt obligations or other securities of BSGA.
Consequently, the Initial Mergers will not give rise to any material BVI tax consequences for BSGA or
the holders of their BSGA Ordinary Shares.
Cayman Islands Tax Considerations
The following summary contains a description of certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of

summary is based upon the tax laws of Cayman Islands and regulations thereunder as of the date hereof,
which are subject to change.
Prospective investors should consult their professional advisers on the possible tax consequences of

prospective and retroactive change. It is not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor’s
particular circumstances, and does not consider tax consequences other than those arising under Cayman
Islands law.
Under Existing Cayman Islands Laws:
Payments of dividends and capital in respect of BTG Securities will not be subject to taxation in the
Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of interest and principal or a dividend or
capital to any holder of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, nor will gains derived from the disposal of the BTG
Class A Ordinary Shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax. The Cayman Islands
currently have no income, corporation or capital gains tax and no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax.
No stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of BTG Securities or on an instrument of transfer in
respect of a BTG Security.
BTG has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited
liability and, as such, has applied for and expects to obtain / obtained an undertaking from the Governor in
Cabinet of the Cayman Islands in the following form:
The Tax Concessions Law
Undertaking as to Tax Concessions
In accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, BTG
plans to apply an undertaking from the Governor in Cabinet:
(a) that no law which is hereafter enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on
profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to BSGA or its operations; and
(b) in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the
nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable:
(i) on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other obligations of BSGA; or
(ii) by way of the withholding in whole or part, of any relevant payment as defined in Section
6(3) of the Tax Concessions Law.
These concessions shall be for a period of TWENTY years from the date of such undertaking.
The Cayman Islands currently levy no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income,
gains or appreciations and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no
other taxes likely to be material to BTG levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands save certain stamp
duties which may be applicable, from time to time, on certain instruments executed in or brought within the
jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands.

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or

Overview
BSGA was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on February 23, 2021, and was formed for the
purpose of effecting a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or
similar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company originally had until June 14, 2022
to consummate a Business Combination, subject to extensions of up to two times, each by an additional
three months (for a total of up to 18 months). BSGA has elected to effectuate such two extensions, as a result
of which the deadline for consummating its initial business combination has been extended to December 14,
2022. On December 5, 2022, BSGA held an extraordinary general meeting at which its shareholders approved
the extension of the date by which BSGA has to consummate a business combination up to four (4) times for
an additional three months each time from December 14, 2022 to December 14, 2023. In order to extend the
time available for BSGA to consummate an initial business combination, BSGA is committed to depositing
US$0.15 for each BSGA Public Share that has not been redeemed into the Trust Account for each three-
month extension. In connection with the extension of business combination period, US$41.99 million was
released from the Trust Account to satisfy the redemptions. BSGA made two deposits in total of
US$515,516.40 to the Trust Account and extended the date by which BSGA has to complete a business
combination from December 14, 2022 to June 14, 2023. Following such redemptions and the deposit, the
amount of funds remaining in the Trust Account is approximately US$18.6 million.
If BSGA is unable to complete its initial business combination by June 14, 2023 or by the applicable
deadline as may be extended by BSGA up to December 14, 2023 pursuant to the Existing BSGA Articles (or a
later date approved by its shareholders) (the “Combination Deadline”), it will: (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to pay its taxes or to fund its
working capital requirements (less up to US$50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the
number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to
applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the
approval of its remaining shareholders and board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to
its obligations under BVI law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Private Placement Units,
which will expire worthless if BSGA fails to complete its initial business combination within the time period
for consummating a business combination as set forth under the BSGA Existing Articles.
Offering Proceeds Held in Trust
On June 14, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 5,000,000 BSGA Units, at US$10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of US$50,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of
292,500 Private Placement Units in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of
US$2,925,000. The underwriters exercised their over-allotment option simultaneously with the IPO for an
additional 750,000 Units. The Units were sold at an offering price of US$10.00 per Unit, generating gross
proceeds of US$7,500,000.
Following the closing of our IPO, an amount of US$58,075,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the
Units our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units was placed in the Trust Account which is invested
in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-
ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7
of the Investment Company Act, as determined by use, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a
business combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account.
181 TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, a total of approximately US$59.6 million and US$58.1
million, respectively, of the net proceeds from the sale of the units in the IPO (including the over-allotment
units), the private placements, and the extension payments to extend the time available for the Company to
consummate the initial Business Combination were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of
the Company’s public shareholders with Continental acting as trustee.
Business Combination Activities
On December 15, 2021, the Merger Agreement was entered into by and among BTG, Bitdeer, BSGA,
BSGA Merger Sub 1, BSGA Merger Sub 2, Bitdeer Merger Sub and BSGA Sub, amending and restating the
agreement and plan of merger dated November 18, 2021, by and among Bitdeer, BSGA and BSGA Sub.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) BSGA Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into BSGA with
BSGA being the surviving entity, (ii) immediately following the First SPAC Merger, BSGA will merge with and
into BSGA Merger Sub 2, with BSGA Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity, and (iii) following the Initial
Mergers, Bitdeer Merger Sub will merge with and into Bitdeer, with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG. The Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are collectively referred to as the Business Combination. The consummation of the
Business Combination remains subject to customary closing conditions.
Redemption Rights
Pursuant to BSGA Existing Articles, our shareholders (except the Initial Shareholders) will be entitled to
redeem their public shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account (currently anticipated to be no less than
approximately US$10.87 per ordinary share), net of taxes payable. The Initial Shareholders do not have
redemption rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly.
Automatic Dissolution and Subsequent Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
If BSGA does not complete a business combination within by the Combination Deadline, it will trigger
the automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of its Articles of Association.
The occurrence of such an event has the same effect as if BSGA had formally gone through a voluntary
liquidation procedure under BVI law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from BSGA Shareholders to
commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. If BSGA is unable to consummate its
initial business combination within such time period, it will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten
business days thereafter, redeem 100% of BSGA’s outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the
funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the
Trust Account and not necessary to pay its taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. In the event of its
dissolution and liquidation, the rights of BSGA will expire and will be worthless.
The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors
that are in preference to the claims of our public shareholders. Although BSGA will seek to have all vendors,
service providers (excluding our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target
businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public
shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such
agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including, but not
limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims
challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a
claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute
an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, BSGA will perform an analysis of
the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a
waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to
us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to
execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are
believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to
execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a
waiver.
182 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Maxim Group LLC, the underwriter in BSGA’s IPO, has not executed agreements with us waiving such
claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. In addition, there is no guarantee that entities will agree to
waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect
the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent
any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with
which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to
below the lesser of (i) US$10.87 per Unit and (ii) the actual amount per Unit held in the Trust Account as of
the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than US$10.87 per share due to reductions in the
value of the Trust Assets, in each case less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any
claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor
will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of IPO against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such
indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to
satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of BSGA.
Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our
officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation, claims by
vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) US$10.87 per
Unit and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of
the Trust Account is less than US$10.87 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each
case less taxes payable, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or
that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would
determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While
BSGA currently expects that its independent directors would take legal action on its behalf against Sponsor
to enforce its indemnification obligations to BSGA, it is possible that BSGA’s independent directors in
exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, BSGA
cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not
be less than US$10.87 per Unit.
If BSGA files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against it that is not
dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may
be included in its bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of
our public shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure
you we will be able to return US$10.87 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a
bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any
distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy
laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could
seek to recover some or all amounts received by our public shareholders. Furthermore, our Board may be
viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and
thereby exposing itself and BSGA to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the
Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be
brought against us for these reasons.
Each of the Initial Shareholders has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of the
Trust Account or other assets with respect to the Private Placement Units they held.
Facilities
We maintain our principal executive offices at The Sun’s Group Center, 29 Floor, 200 Gloucester Road,
Wan Chai, Hong Kong. An affiliate of our Sponsor is providing this space for a fee of US$10,000 per month.
We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
BSGA has two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of
hours to its matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to its affairs. BSGA’s
executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to BSGA’s
business. BSGA does not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business
combination.

Nominating Committee
Our Nominating Committee consists of Messrs. Mark Streeter, Joseph Chow and Dr. Rolf Hoefer, each of
whom is an independent director under Nasdaq’s listing standards. Joseph Chow serves as chairman of the
nominating committee. The nominating committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of persons to
be nominated to serve on our board of directors. The nominating committee considers persons identified by
its members, management, shareholders, investment bankers and others.
The guidelines for selecting nominees, which are specified in BSGA’s Nominating Committee Charter,
generally provide that persons to be nominated:
should have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business, education or public
service;
should possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make a significant contribution
to the board of directors and bring a range of skills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its
deliberations; and

to serving the interests of the shareholders.
The nominating committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and
leadership experience, background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person’s candidacy for
membership on the board of directors. The nominating committee may require certain skills or attributes,
such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and will
also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board
members. The nominating committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders
and other persons.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Conflicts of Interest
Under British Virgin Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties:
should have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business, education or public
service;
duty to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the
company as a whole;
duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a
collateral purpose;
directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion;
duty to exercise powers fairly as between different classes of shareholders;
duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the
company and their personal interests; and
duty to exercise independent judgment.
In addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty
has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge,
skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are
carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience which
that director has.
As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes
a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some
instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by
the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of
permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by
shareholder approval at general meetings.
Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers
may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or
director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his
or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an
acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or
contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present
such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity.
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, subject to his or her
fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity
offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or
her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and
contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe,
however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially
undermine our ability to complete our business combination.
Our Sponsor, officers and directors may become officers or directors of other special purpose
acquisition companies. Notwithstanding that, such officers and directors will continue to have a pre-existing
fiduciary obligation to us and we will, therefore, have priority over any special purpose acquisition
companies they subsequently join. Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential
conflicts of interest:
None of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and,
accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business
activities.
In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of
investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the
other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in
188 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. For a complete
description of our management’s other affiliations, see “- Directors and Officers.”
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to our
Founder Shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination. Additionally, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination
within 12 months after the closing of this offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of this offering
if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time). If
we do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds
of the sale of the private placement units held in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption
of our public shares and rights will expire worthless. With certain limited exceptions, the Founder
Shares will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our Sponsor until the earlier of (1) six months
after the completion of our initial business combination and (2) the date on which we consummate a
liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization, or other similar transaction after our initial
business combination that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their
ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale
price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds US$12.00 per share (as adjusted for share
splits, share capitalizations, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the
like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after our initial business
combination, the Founder Shares will be released from the lock-up. With certain limited exceptions,
the private placement units, private placement shares, private placement rights and the Class A
ordinary shares underlying such rights will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our Sponsor
until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. Since our Sponsor and officers
and directors may directly or indirectly own ordinary shares and rights following this offering, our
officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target
business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.
Given the difference between (i) the purchase price that the Sponsor paid for the Founder Shares, and
(ii) the price of the Public Shares, and considering the substantial number of BTG Class A Ordinary
Shares that the Sponsor will receive upon conversion of the Founder Shares, the Sponsor can earn a
positive return on their investment, even if other BSGA shareholders have a negative return on their
investment in BTG.
Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular
business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included
by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
The conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and
directors have certain interests in the Business Combination, which may create actual or potential conflicts
of interest, and these interests are, to the extent material, described in the section entitled “The Business
Combination Proposal - Interests of BSGA Directors and Officers in the Business Combination.” The
foregoing interests present a risk that the Sponsor, BSGA’s officers and directors, and their affiliates will
benefit from the completion of a business combination, including in a manner that may not be aligned with
the Public Shareholders. As such, the Sponsor and BSGA’s officers and directors may be incentivized to
complete a business combination with a less favorable target company or on terms less favorable to Public
Shareholders rather than to liquidate.
Accordingly, if any of the above officers or directors become aware of a business combination
opportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or
contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such
business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the
opportunity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law. We do not believe,
however, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations will materially affect our ability
to complete our initial business combination, because the specific industry focuses of a majority of these
entities differ from our focus on consumer/lifestyle businesses and the type or size of the transaction that
such companies would most likely consider are of a size and nature substantially different than what we are
targeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated
with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination
with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an
independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions
for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial
business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our
Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us,
to vote any Founder Shares held by them (and their permitted transferees will agree) and any public shares
purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination.
Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors
BVI law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for
indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any provision providing indemnification may be
held by the BVI courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud
or the consequences of committing a crime. Under our memorandum and articles of association, we indemnify
against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings for any person
who:
is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the
person is or was our director; or
is or was, at our request, serving as a director or officer of, or in any other capacity is or was acting
for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprises.
These indemnities only apply if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to our best
interests and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.
This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation
Law for a Delaware corporation. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may
be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have
been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
Employment Agreements
BSGA has not entered into any employment agreements with its executive officers, and has not made
any agreements to provide benefits upon termination of employment.
Executive Officers and Director Compensation
No executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation
of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing
shareholders, including our directors, or any of their respective affiliates prior to the consummation of a
business combination. However, such individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing
due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of these out-of-pocket
expenses and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board
of directors and audit committee, which includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of
competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged.

OPERATION
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a business company and
incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,

191 TABLE OF CONTENTS
On May 30, 2022, we entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the “First Amendment”, and the Merger Agreement as amended by such Amendment, the “First
Amended Merger Agreement”) with BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub and
Bitdeer, to amend the Merger Agreement. The First Amendment extends the termination date upon which
either we or Bitdeer may terminate the Merger Agreement, from May 31, 2022 to September 1, 2022. In
addition, pursuant to the First Amendment, Bitdeer will provide certain interest-free loans with an aggregate
principal amount of US$1,993,000 to us to fund any amount that may be required in order to extend the period
of time available for us to consummate a business combination and for our working capital. Such loans will
only become repayable upon the closing of the Business Combination.
On December 2, 2022, we entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the “Second Amendment”) with BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger
Sub and Bitdeer, to amend the Merger Agreement. The Second Amendment extends the termination date
upon which either we or Bitdeer may terminate the Merger Agreement, from September 1, 2022 to the earlier
of (i) June 1, 2023 and (ii) the then applicable deadline for us to complete a business combination in
accordance with our organizational documents. In addition, pursuant to the Second Amendment, Bitdeer will
provide certain interest-free loans with an aggregate principal amount of US$2,584,141 to us to fund any
amount that may be required in order to extend the period of time available for us to consummate a business
combination and for our working capital. Such loans will only become repayable upon the closing of the
Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022, we received US$2,545,800 under such loan.
On December 5, 2022, the holders of 4,031,612 BSGA Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their
right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately US$10.41505502 per share, for an
aggregate redemption amount of approximately US$41.99 million.
On March 7, 2023, BSGA entered into a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the “Third Amendment”, and the Second Amended Merger Agreement as amended by such
Third Amendment, the “Third Amended Merger Agreement”) with BTG, BSGA Merger Sub 1, BSGA Merger
Sub 2, BSGA Merger Sub 3, BSGA Sub and Bitdeer. The Third Amendment revises the definition of “Per
Share Equity Value” to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) US$1,180,000,000 by (ii) Bitdeer Total Shares.
Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the parties thereto also agreed to remove the American Depository Share
structure previously contemplated under the Second Amended Merger Agreement and instead issue
ordinary shares of BTG as considerations to be paid pursuant to the Third Amended Merger Agreement.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenue to date. Our only
activities from inception through December 31, 2022 were organizational activities and those necessary to
prepare for the Initial Public Offering, and, following our initial public offering, identifying a target business
with which to engage in a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenue until
after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the
form of interest income on marketable securities held after the Initial Public Offering. We expect that we will
incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and
auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing,
a Business Combination.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of US$3,917,800, which consists of operation
costs amounting to US$4,660,233, offset by the interest income from investments in our Trust Account of
US$742,433.
For the period from February 23, 2021 (Inception) to December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of
US$1,239,720, which consists of operation costs amounting to US$1,241,824, offset by the interest income
from investments in our Trust Account of US$2,104.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On June 14, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 5,000,000 BSGA Units. Each BSGA Unit consists of one
BSGA Ordinary Share and one BSGA Right to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the
192 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
consummation of an initial business combination. The BSGA Units were sold at an offering price of US$10.00
per Unit, generating gross proceeds of US$50,000,000. We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to
purchase up to 750,000 additional BSGA Units to cover over-allotments, if any, which the underwriters
exercised in full simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO. The total aggregate issuance by us of
5,750,000 units at a price of US$10.00 per unit resulted in a total gross proceeds of US$57,500,000.
As of June 14, 2021, a total of US$58,075,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement
(as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of BSGA’s public
shareholders. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private
Placement”) with BSG First Euro Investment Corp., our Sponsor, of 292,500 units (the “Private Units”) at a
price of US$10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of US$2,925,000. The Private Units are identical
to the Units sold in the IPO. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of
the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration
Statement) until 30 days after the completion of BSGA’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers
were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the
Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
Following the IPO and the sale of the Private Units, a total of US$58,075,000 was placed in the Trust
Account, and we had US$884,500 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related
to the Initial Public Offering, and available for working capital purposes. We incurred US$4,158,799 in
transaction costs, including US$1,150,000 of underwriting fees, US$2,012,500 of deferred underwriting fees,
the fair value of the representative shares of US$478,857, and US$517,442 of other offering costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, there was US$1,064,156 of cash used in operating activities. Net
loss of US$917,800 was affected by interest earned on cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account
amounting to US$742,433 and offset by changes in current assets and liabilities of US$3,596,077.
For the period from February 23, 2021 (Inception) to December 31, 2021, there was US$398,627 of cash
used in operating activities. Net loss of US$1,239,720 was resulting from formation costs paid by the Sponsor
of US$7,169, changes in current assets and liabilities of US$836,028, offset by interest earned on cash and
marketable securities held in Trust Account amounting to US$2,104.
As of December 31, 2022, we had US$487,303 of cash on hand and working capital deficit of
US$6,602,257.
The Company expect to incur increased expenses since becoming a public company (for legal, financial
reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses in connection with the initial business
combination.
On June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, we deposited into our
Trust Account an additional US$575,000 (representing US$0.10 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the
combination period from June 14, 2022 to September 14, 2022. On September 6, 2022, using the loan amount
received to date, we deposited into our Trust Account an additional US$575,000 (representing US$0.10 per
Class A ordinary share) to extend the period for BSGA to consummate its initial business combination from
September 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, we
deposited into our Trust Account an additional US$257,758.20 (representing US$0.15 per Class A ordinary
share) to extend the period for BSGA to consummate its initial business combination from December 14, 2022
to March 14, 2023. On March 6, 2023, we further deposited into our Trust Account an additional
US$257,758.20 to extend the period for BSGA to consummate its initial business combination from March 14,
2023 to June 14, 2023. It is uncertain that we will be able consummate a business combination by any of such
dates. If a business combination is not consummated by the required dates, there will be a mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern
considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern”, management has determined that mandatory liquidation, and
subsequent dissolution, should we be unable to complete a business combination, raises substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. If a business combination is not consummated by this date,
193 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. No adjustments have been made to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities should we be required to liquidate after June 14, 2023.
Based upon the above analysis, management determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial
statements are issued.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements
as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been
established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-
balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or
commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual Obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term
liabilities other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of US$10,000 for office space, utilities
and secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on June 14, 2021 and will continue
to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our
liquidation.
The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public
Offering, or US$2,012,500. The deferred fee will be payable in cash to the underwriters solely in the event
that we complete a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms
of the underwriting agreement.
Pursuant to the Second Amendment, Bitdeer will provide certain interest-free loans with an aggregate
principal amount of US$2,584,141 to us to fund any amount that may be required in order to extend the period
of time available for us to consummate a business combination and for our working capital. Such loans will
only become repayable upon the closing of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022, we received
US$2,545,800 under such loans.
On March 1, 2021, we issued a promissory note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which we may borrow up to
an aggregate principal amount of $200,000. The promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the
date that we consummate the IPO of our securities or the date on which we determine not to conduct an IPO.
The maturity date of the promissory note was August 31, 2022, provided that we may in our sole discretion,
and upon written notice to the Sponsor, extend such maturity date for an additional six months in the event
that we have not repaid in full the principal amount and accrued interest by August 31, 2022 pursuant to the
amended Promissory Note issued on May 30, 2022. On August 31, 2022, we issued an extension notice to the
Sponsor, to extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note for an additional six (6) months from August 31,
2022 to February 28, 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had borrowed $200,000 under the
promissory note.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the consolidated financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting
policies:
Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption
We account for the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with
the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from
194 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Equity.” The BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption is classified as a liability
instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares (including
BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder
thereof or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is
classified as temporary equity. At all other times, BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares are classified as
shareholders’ equity. BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to
be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, all BSGA Class
A Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity,
outside of the shareholders’ equity section of our balance sheet
Net Loss Per Ordinary Share
We comply with the accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share.”
Net loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. We have two classes
of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Earnings and losses
are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have
any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary
shares and then share in the earnings of us. As a result, diluted loss per ordinary share is the same as basic
loss per ordinary share for the period presented. We do not believe there is significant estimation
uncertainty and therefore we do not expect potential impact on earning per share.

Overview
Bitdeer is a world-leading technology company for the cryptocurrency mining community. As of June
30, 2022, we were the world’s second largest holder of proprietary hash rate, which is defined as hash rate
generated from proprietary mining machines; by allocating part of our proprietary hash rate for sale, we were
the world’s largest supplier of hash rate, as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing
market, which is defined as a market where players sell part of their hash rate to customers, according to
Frost & Sullivan.
We mine cryptocurrencies for our own account and serve the cryptocurrency mining community by
providing innovative, reliable and easy-to-use cryptocurrency mining solutions. Headquartered in
Singapore, we currently operate five proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and Norway with an
aggregate electricity capacity of 522MW as of June 30, 2022, which had increased to 775MW by the end of
2022 by expanding our footprints to six mining datacenters globally. From these mining datacenters, we
generate managing hash rate which is categorized into proprietary and hosting hash rate. As of June 30,
2022, our proprietary hash rate reached 4.2 EH/s and accounted for 1.8% of the total Bitcoin network hash
rate, making us the second largest holder of proprietary hash rate across the globe, according to Frost &
Sullivan. Together with the 6.3 EH/s hosting hash rate generated from mining machines hosted in our mining
datacenters, we possessed a total of 10.5 EH/s of managing hash rate as of June 30, 2022, accounting for
approximately 4.6% of the total Bitcoin network hash rate.
To date, we primarily operate three business lines - “proprietary mining,” “hash rate sharing” and
“hosting.” Proprietary mining refers to cryptocurrency mining for our own account, which allows us to
directly capture the high appreciation potential of cryptocurrency. We offer two types of hash rate sharing
solutions, Cloud Hash Rate and Hash Rate Marketplace. Through Cloud Hash Rate, we sell our proprietary
hash rate to customers. We offer hash rate subscription plans at fixed price and share mining income with
them under certain arrangements. As of June 30, 2022, our Cloud Hash Rate business achieved a market
share of 37.4% as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing market, according to Frost &
Sullivan. Through Hash Rate Marketplace, we connect reliable third-party hash rate suppliers with hash rate
users to facilitate hash rate sales and generate revenue from charging service fees. Our hosting services
offer customers one-stop mining machine hosting solutions encompassing deployment, maintenance and
management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining. Among a wide selection of hosting services,
customers can either subscribe to our Cloud Hosting service for the specified mining machines from which
they derive computing power under a “group-buying” model, or send their mining machines to our mining
datacenters for hosting under the General Hosting option or the Membership Hosting option. Historically,
our hosting hash rate were generated from Cloud Hosting and General Hosting. All of our three business
lines are supported by Minerplus, our self-developed integrated intelligent software platform, which offers
software support to significantly reduce time needed for daily maintenance and mining machine upgrade and
substantially decrease operation and maintenance headcount.
We source mining machines from a wide variety of manufacturers and traders with whom we have built
robust relationships over the years. As a result, the majority of our mining machines are spot machines for
the most recent and most commonly used models procured at a favorable price, which ensures high energy
efficiency and stable hash rate supply both in quality and in quantum. We also engage in the sales of mining
machines from time to time. We stay at the forefront of technology development. As a market player who is
able to obtain a hash rate unit of 1TH/s through our hash rate slicing technology, we have been successfully
maintaining a less than 5% fluctuation for 98% of our hash rate sales contracts.
We have achieved significant operational and financial results in recent periods. As of June 30, 2022, we
generated 4.2EH/s proprietary hash rate from our proprietary mining machines and operated mining
datacenters with an aggregate electricity capacity of 522MW. Our revenue increased by 110.0% from US$88.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$186.4 million for the year ended December 31,
196 TABLE OF CONTENTS
2020, and further increased by 111.7% to US$394.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the first
six months in 2022, we generated US$179.6 million in total net revenue, as compared to US$219.7 million
generated for the first six months in 2021. We incurred net loss of US$27.9 million and US$55.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, generated net profit of US$113.8 million and US$82.6
million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2021, and incurred net loss
of US$25.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 195.2% from
US$16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$48.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, and further increased by 479.2% to US$281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the six
months ended June 30, 2022, our adjusted EBITDA was US$68.2 million, as compared to US$183.2 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2021. However, our recent growth trends may not continue and we may not be
able to maintain or increase our profitability over the long term.
The crypto asset market, especially the price of Bitcoin, has been highly volatile. Recent industry-wide
developments, including the continued industry-wide fallout from the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of
cryptocurrency exchange FTX (including its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC), crypto hedge
fund Three Arrows, crypto miners Compute North and Core Scientific and crypto lenders Celsius Network,
Voyager Digital and BlockFi, are beyond our control. We are not directly affected by these recent incidents,
as we do not have any counterparty credit exposure to the above-mentioned firms nor expect their potential
bankruptcy to have any direct impact on our business or operations.
That being said, the decrease and volatility of Bitcoin price as a result of the recent industry-wide
developments has affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, our
proprietary mining business has become less profitable due to the drop in Bitcoin price. For the hash rate
sharing and hosting businesses, the demand for such products has become lower due to the relatively
bearish market on Bitcoin and the crypto asset market in general. However, we believe that, as compared to
many other participants in the crypto assets markets, we are more resilient to cryptocurrency price volatility
as our “hash rate sharing” and “hosting” businesses allow us to smooth the impact of cryptocurrency price
volatility, as compared to “proprietary mining.”
Our Strengths
We believe that the following strengths contribute to our success and differentiate us from our
competitors.
World’s leading scale of proprietary hash rate
We are the second largest holder of proprietary hash rate for Bitcoin across the globe, according to
Frost & Sullivan. As of June 30, 2022, our proprietary hash rate operated in our global mining datacenters
reached 4.2 EH/s and accounted for 1.8% of the total Bitcoin network hash rate. Our proprietary hash rate
provides us with a clear edge across our business lines and anchors our unique business model. High
proprietary hash rate increases our chance of success in obtaining cryptocurrency rewards. It also allows a
stable supply of hash rate products to our customers through Cloud Hash Rate. As a result, we achieved a
market share of 37.4% in the cloud hash rate sharing market as measured by hash rate for sale as of June 30,
2022, according to Frost & Sullivan. Leveraging our track record of operating the Cloud Hash Rate business,
we boosted user confidence in our brand and was able to launch Hash Rate Marketplace as our hash rate
retail platform in the first half of 2021. In addition to proprietary hash rate, we also generate hosting hash
rate, the other category of our total managing hash rate, from mining machines that are hosted in our mining
datacenters. Together with the 6.3 EH/s hosting hash rate, we managed a total of 10.5 EH/s hash rate as of
June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, we operated five proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and
Norway to support our proprietary and hosting hash rate.
Unique business model powers organic hash rate expansion by generating instant and continuous cash
We have established a business model that allows us to constantly reinforce our market-leading
position and outpace our competitors in terms of scaling up our proprietary hash rate. A prevailing strategy
to profit from proprietary hash rate is mining. The cryptocurrencies mined can be sold at a profit when their
market value is high enough to cover the cost of mining machines, electricity fees and other mining-related
expenses. While we remain engaged in proprietary mining business to capture the high appreciation
potential of
197 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cryptocurrency, we strategically allocate a significant amount of proprietary hash rate to hash rate sales
through Cloud Hash Rate, to enable instant cash pay-back upon customers’ subscription to our hash rate
plans. We have successfully boosted sales for hash rate, in particular, for long-term hash rate subscription
plans (i.e., plans with a term longer than 720 days) by providing an increasing amount of reliable and
transparent hash rate supply. We generally generate proceeds from hash rate sales under long-term hash rate
subscription plans that approximate the purchase cost of mining machines. Therefore, we are able to
continuously grow our proprietary hash rate by funding the purchase of additional mining fleets with the
instant cash collected from hash rate sales using our existing mining fleets, significantly reducing our pay-
back period to one month, compared to the long pay-back period associated with cryptocurrency mining
activities, which is typically from 6 to 18 months, according to Frost & Sullivan. This unique model also
allows us to smooth the impact of cryptocurrency price volatility as our proceeds from hash rate sales are
less directly related to cryptocurrency price compared to proprietary mining.
Ample power supply and low electricity cost secured by global mining datacenters
We strategically opened five mining datacenters in the United States and Norway, where low electricity
cost and crypto-friendly policies support stable operations. As of June 30, 2022, our mining datacenters had
a power supply of 522MW. We plan to expand our footprints to six mining datacenters across the globe to
increase our total electricity capacity to approximately 1,374MW, including 452MW power supply under
construction and 400MW power supply “in the pipeline,” contracted but not yet under active construction.
Our premier mining datacenters allowed us to successfully lower the average electricity cost of our mining
datacenters to US$40/MWh for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was significantly below the
estimated global average of US$49/MWh during the same period, according to Frost & Sullivan. Our ability
to secure ample power supply with low electricity cost is underpinned by our top-notch experience and
capabilities in global mining datacenters deployment and operation. We pioneer in deploying and operating
mining datacenters globally. With experience in site selection, facility design, construction and maintenance
in over 30 locations around the globe, our dedicated global team for mining datacenter construction
understands the critical needs of Bitcoin mining as well as the complex and constantly evolving global
landscape of electricity supply. They also have extensive connections with local electricity experts and
power enterprises around the world. We are the first in the industry to develop the “PERT” approach to
secure prime locations for our mining datacenters, which stands for a comprehensive site selection approach
encompassing local electricity and cryptocurrency mining Policy, Electricity cost, Resources and
connections, and Technical feasibility. We believe we can continue to apply this systematic approach, our
insights and rich execution experience to global mining datacenter construction in the future, and hence
achieve advantages in electricity capacity and electricity costs among our competitors.
Visionary management team with a proven track record of innovation and execution
Our success is driven by a passionate, visionary, tech-savvy and entrepreneurial management team with
a proven execution track record. This management team is led by our founder, Mr. Jihan Wu, a pioneer and
leading figure in the cryptocurrency industry. Mr. Wu is viewed as an early advocate of cryptocurrency who
introduced the Bitcoin Whitepaper into the Sinophone world. Our management team has extensive
experience in the cryptocurrency industry, encompassing research and development, mining and sales of
mining machines, and many of them are pioneers in mining datacenters construction and operation.
Our Growth Strategies
We intend to focus on the following key strategies to grow our business.
Build a hash rate retail platform to facilitate the growth of the mining community
We believe that we have been and will continue to be a major contributor to the crypto-economy, with
our vision to build a one-stop hash rate retail platform for the mining community. Since our inception, by
delivering high quality and reliable hash rate, we boost consumer confidence and stimulate demand for hash
rate without heavily relying on marketing campaigns. We have seen growth in hash rate sales as a result of
our efforts.
198 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
As we increase our scale of operations and generate more hash rate over time, we have rolled out
multiple product offerings, based on which we aim to create a hash rate retail platform that is uniquely
positioned to serve both hash rate users and suppliers. Not only are we the largest supplier of hash rate
ourselves as of June 30, 2022, as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing market,
according to Frost & Sullivan, we proactively partner with third-party hash rate suppliers, some of which are
customers of our hosting services. Abundant supply of hash rate attracts and retains hash rate users to our
Hash Rate Marketplace. By building this retail platform, we aim to establish a cryptocurrency mining
community that is centered around and reinforced by our operations, where hash rate users and suppliers
get to continually empower each other. We aim to deliver diverse, quality and transparent hash rate products
that lower the entry barrier of cryptocurrency mining as well as hash rate supply. We believe that the mining
community surrounding us will grow and prosper as a result, and that we will significantly benefit from being
at the core of this mining community.
Continue to scale up our mining datacenters
We believe mining datacenter capacity is critical to growing our proprietary hash rate and building the
infrastructure needed to support our booming hosting business. We currently operate five mining
datacenters in the United States and Norway, and plan to continue to scale up our mining datacenters across
the globe, by expanding existing mining datacenters and constructing new ones. To this end, we are actively
strategizing our mining datacenter expansion and are paying special attention to North American, North
Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia, where we have the most connections and experience with. We are
also exploring innovative partnership models, including joint venture, to better work with our local partners
and scale up our mining datacenters in a more efficient manner.
Continue to enrich our product and services portfolio by supporting diversified crypto protocols
While our services primarily support PoW protocol currently, we intend to enrich our product and
service portfolio by providing mining services covering new crypto protocols, including PoS, DPoS, PoST
and PoC, and steadily increase the weight of new business to diversify revenue streams and attract new
customers who are users of these new crypto protocols.
Improve our product and service quality through more powerful Minerplus support
While we have accumulated a large user base for Minerplus, our self-developed integrated intelligent
software platform that significantly reduces time needed for daily maintenance and mining machine upgrade
and substantially decreases operation and maintenance headcount, we intend to continuously upgrade
Minerplus to provide more miners with professional and value-added support regarding real-time mining
datacenter and mining machine monitoring, hash rate protection and virus detection and removal, etc., to
boost mining efficiency. Minerplus’s hash rate monitoring function also enables us to keep track of the
quality of third-party hash rate products on Hash Rate Marketplace and we can therefore ensure hash rate
suppliers admitted to Hash Rate Marketplace are able to provide hash rate products that meet our quality
standard. With access to a larger amount of data generated from mining activities through Minerplus, we
expect to gain a better understanding of the quality of power supply in different mining sites as well as the
demands and pain points of miners. We intend to create data-driven synergies including discovering prime
mining site locations, determining the metrics of diverse hash rate products that cater to hash rate users’
needs as well as offering more advanced mining machine deployment and operation solutions.
Our Business Lines and Software Infrastructure
To date, we primarily operate three business lines - “proprietary mining,” “hash rate sharing” and
“hosting,” all of which are supported by Minerplus, our self-developed integrated intelligent software
platform, to enhance operational efficiency.
Proprietary mining
We mine cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoins, for our own account. Proprietary mining allows us to
capture the high appreciation potential of cryptocurrency to support our future expansion and operation. For
the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022,
199 
•

TABLE OF CONTENTS
respectively, we generated US$37.5 million, US$88.5 million, US$191.7 million, US$111.3 million and US$41.0
million in revenue from proprietary mining. Historically, approximately 50% of our proprietary hash rate was
utilized to support our proprietary mining, with the rest available for sale to customers through Cloud Hash
Rate. However, we retain the flexibility to allocate our proprietary hash rate to either proprietary mining or
Cloud Hash Rate, primarily based on our view of the Bitcoin market trends.
Hash rate sharing
We offer two types of hash rate sharing solutions, Cloud Hash Rate and Hash Rate Marketplace, to
support cryptocurrency mining activities globally with convenient, transparent and reliable hash rate.
Cloud Hash Rate. Through Cloud Hash Rate, customers enter into hash rate contracts with us to
subscribe to the hash rate derived from our proprietary mining machines, saving themselves from
purchasing, installing or hosting mining machines. Cloud Hash Rate features authentic and
transparent hash rate products as users can track the hash rate output on their chosen third-party
mining pool, easily ascertain that they receive the right value and receive payments directly from
mining pools. With our hash rate slicing and hash rate scheduling technologies, we are able to
maintain a less than 5% fluctuation for 98% of our hash rate contracts and provide our customers
100% continuous online computing power for series of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Filecoin,
Litecoin, Nervos CKB, Zcash, etc., subject to stable electricity supply. We offer our customers
various hash rate subscription plans, primarily under (i) “classic mode” and (ii) “accelerator mode”,
which enables customers to shorten investment costs recovery cycle. After a user subscribes to a
cloud hash rate plan, mining pool operators connect the cloud hash rate generated from our mining
machines to blockchain network for a period specified in the cloud hash rate plan subscribed to and
cryptocurrency rewards are delivered directly to the crypto wallet of the Cloud Hash Rate customer.
For plans under “classic mode”, we generate revenue from fees paid to subscribe the hash rate as well
as electricity, which maintains the mining machines that produce the subscribed hash rate. For hash
rate subscription plans under “accelerator mode”, while customers enjoy lower hash rate subscription
fees compared to “classic mode”, on top of the aforementioned hash rate and electricity subscription
fees, we are also entitled to sharing part of the mining rewards net of the electricity cost the customer
paid for once that customer’s investment cost is recovered, which is defined as the cumulative mining
reward received from the mining pool equals the amount of hash rate subscription fees paid upfront
and the electricity fee paid and used to date. This unique model of selling cloud hash rate allows us
to smooth the impact of Bitcoin price volatility as our income from hash rate sales are less directly
related to cryptocurrency price compared to proprietary mining. When Bitcoin price appreciates, we
can capture part of the benefits as the demand of hash rate will be driven up; when Bitcoin price
depreciates, we are still able to recover costs or generate revenue from hash rate sales. We use
standard agreement with our customer for Cloud Hash Rate. For the years ended December 31, 2019,
2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, we generated US$43.5
million, US$78.3 million, US$124.2 million US$62.0 million and US$74.9 million in revenue from Cloud
Hash Rate.
Hash Rate Marketplace. We connect supply of hash rate from mining machines owned by third parties,
such as miners or mining datacenter owners, with our user base with hash rate demands, allowing
such hash rate suppliers to access our large base of high-quality customers. With the newly rolled-
out Hash Rate Marketplace, we offer a marketplace that is able to utilize excessive hash rate in the
network and expand ways of monetization for third-party hash rate suppliers, accelerating their cash
pay-back to support future expansion. For transactions completed on Hash Rate Marketplace, the
third-party hash rate suppliers will be responsible for providing hash rate and post-sale services,
pursuant to the negotiated terms between these third-party hash rate suppliers and customers, with
which we have no involvement and we generate revenue by charging service fees. Revenue
generated from Hash Rate Marketplace was immaterial prior to June 30, 2022.
Hosting
We offer three types of hosting services, Cloud Hosting, General Hosting and Membership Hosting, to
meet customers’ diverse demands for professional hosting solutions and lower the prohibitive upfront
investment costs associated with mining datacenter construction, deployment and operation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Cloud Hosting. We provide retail miner customers with one-stop mining machine hosting solutions,
enabling them to gain access to stable supply of computing power from specified mining machines in
a capital-light manner. Through Cloud Hosting, users participate in a customer group, pay an upfront
fee for the computing power produced by the specified mining machines, and subscribe to the
hosting service for the same mining machines. As such, customers may enjoy the computing power
derived from specified mining machines over the life of such mining machines to generate
cryptocurrency rewards. Traditionally, a miner has to purchase and physically possess a mining
machine, deploy and operate it in a mining datacenter in order to gain access to all the computing
power generated from that specified mining machine. Cloud Hosting provides an innovative
alternative by providing hosting service for the specified mining machines that produce computing
power for the Cloud Hosting customers, saving the customers the need to pick up the mining
machine, construct one’s own mining datacenter, and operate and deploy the mining machine.
Specifically, we are responsible for the operation and maintenance of mining datacenter that hosts the
mining machines, as well as mining machine operation, maintenance and repair. As such, we
significantly lower the upfront investment and expertise threshold for retail miners, providing them
with the same opportunity of cryptocurrency returns as major and sophisticated miners. We also
provide complete set of cloud hosting technical solutions and resources to ensure operational
efficiency. Our first-of-its-kind “group-buying” model allows retail miners to purchase the computing
service from and maintenance service for as little as one mining machine, further lessening the
upfront investment burden. Similar to the Cloud Hash Rate “accelerator mode” subscription plans, in
2021, we launched the “accelerated payback mode” for Cloud Hosting, where customers can enjoy a
favorable rate for the upfront fee compared to “classic mode”  (i.e., the traditional arrangement). Under
the standard agreements with our customers for Cloud Hosting, we charge customers an upfront fee
so they can secure the procurement of computing power from the specified mining machines. We also
charge a maintenance fee for our electricity supply, daily maintenance and repair care. We are entitled
to a portion of the mining profit of an “accelerated payback mode” customer after the customer
recovers the investment cost, which is defined as the mining reward earned from the mining pool
equals the upfront fee paid and the maintenance fee and other fees incurred to date. For the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, the
revenue generated from Cloud Hosting was nil, US$2.9 million, US$7.6 million, US$6.0 million and
US$6.8 million, respectively. We did not generate any revenue from mining profit sharing from plans
under Cloud Hosting’s “accelerated payback mode” for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six
months ended June 30, 2022.
General Hosting. We offer hosting solutions to professional miner customers who send their mining
machines to our mining datacenters for hosting. Specifically, we provide server room, professional
support from technical and managerial personnel, supporting power, network and security monitoring
facilities, among others, and carry out routine maintenance, system configurations, troubleshooting
and daily reporting to ensure a smooth operation of the hosted mining machines. At the customers’
option, we also provide assistance for deployment, installation and removal of hosted mining
machines and repairment of mining machines. Under the standard agreements with General Hosting
customers, we charge monthly service fees, which include costs of operating and maintaining the
mining machines, costs of electricity and other costs mainly related to mining machine deployment
and repair. We generated no revenue prior to December 31, 2020 and revenue of US$18.3 million,
US$0.9 million and US$53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended
June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, from General Hosting.
Membership Hosting. We offer a membership program for large-scale miner customers who seek stable,
long-term supply of hosting capacity and send their mining machines to our mining datacenters for
hosting purpose. In addition to the hosting services we provide to customers under General Hosting
mentioned above, customers of this membership program enjoy program benefits, including, among
other things, (i) early, priority and exclusive access to the newly available hosting capacity that is
sufficient for large-scale miners, upon a new mining datacenter becomes available and (ii) favorable
pricing terms for our hosting services such as mining datacenter and mining machine operations and
maintenance as well as mining machine deployment. We charge membership fees, and service fees,
which include costs of operating and maintaining the mining machines, costs of electricity and other
costs mainly related to mining machine deployment and repair. For our Membership Hosting
contracts,
201 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
payment terms are individually negotiated and may differ among customers. Through this membership
program, we seek to facilitate risk control and stable hosting income from large-scale miner customers
by providing them reliable and long-term hosting capacity. We also intend to leverage our
Membership Hosting to facilitate the growth of Hash Rate Marketplace as we encourage some of the
Membership Hosting customers to become hash rate suppliers on our Hash Rate Marketplace. We
generated no revenue from Membership Hosting prior to June 30, 2022.
The major differences between Cloud Hosting and General Hosting are the source of mining machines,
the intended customer base and the business model that we generate revenue from. Cloud Hosting leverages
mining machines from existing mining fleets owned by us and serves retail miner customers under a “group-
buying” model, with an upfront fee charged at the commencement of the service and continuing maintenance
fees charged throughout the whole service process. General Hosting, just like other industry players, hosts
mining machines received from professional miner customers that look to expand their mining operation in
exchange for monthly hosting fees. We expect to continue offering existing Cloud Hosting plans but no
longer as our mainstream product. In the near future, we expect to focus on further expanding our General
Hosting services by allocating a greater portion of our growing mining datacenter capacity to General
Hosting. We believe that focusing on General Hosting will enable us to maximize assets utilization with
minimal capital expenditure for our growing mining datacenter capacity, maximize overall scale of hash rate
supported by our software platform Minerplus which may lead to future business opportunities, and improve
the operational efficiency by serving professional customers.
Minerplus is our self-developed integrated intelligent software platform that offers software support to
significantly reduce time needed for daily maintenance and mining machine upgrade and substantially
decrease operation and maintenance headcount. The functions of Minerplus mainly encompasses real-time
mining datacenter and hash rate monitoring as well as virus detection and removal. Minerplus enables
intelligent management of our proprietary mining business and enhances product and service quality of
Cloud Hash Rate and our hosting services. We also provide standalone Minerplus service to third-party
mining datacenters.
Measures to prevent unauthorized or impermissible customer access
We have established anti-money laundering (“AML”) processes, know your customer (“KYC”)
procedures and IP address geo-blocking measures, to prevent unauthorized and impermissible access to our
hash rate products by U.S. customers and customers from other jurisdictions where we have identified laws
or regulations that restrict the offering of our hash rate products. These measures generally encompass the
following key steps: 1) following IP address and customer identification, IP addresses located in regions
such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Crimea Area, will be blocked, and IP addresses in most other
areas, including the United States, will be asked to complete AML and KYC procedures prior to purchasing
our products and services; 2) following and based on the results of customer due diligence process,
customers from the United States or other applicable jurisdictions will be denied purchase of our hash rate
products; 3) transactions and the KYC status of the customers will be subject to our monitoring and periodic
review.
For a discussion of the risks relating to offering our hash rate products to U.S. customers and/or
customers from other jurisdictions where such offering may be restricted, see the section entitled “Risk
Factors - Risks Related to Bitdeer - Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Other Legal Matters - 
Bitdeer’s hash rate sharing business may be subject to U.S. jurisdiction if Bitdeer is not able to avoid
offering or selling its hash rate products to U.S. customers. Additionally, Bitdeer’s hash rate sharing
business may be deemed as securities offerings in other jurisdictions where it is offered.”

78.8%, 84.5%, 93.4% and 95.8% of our Cloud Hash Rate revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 were generated from hash rate plans subscribed for
Bitcoin mining. In the second half of 2021, we commenced mining operation on a proprietary basis for
Filecoin, which adopted PoST protocol, and also offered computing power sharing solutions regarding
Filecoin mining under our Cloud Hash Rate business. While we intend to enrich our product and service
portfolio by providing mining services covering new crypto protocols, including PoS, DPoS, PoST and PoC,
we have not determined the type of cryptocurrency to expand our operations.
Policies and Procedures Related to Our Cryptocurrencies
We obtain cryptocurrencies from proprietary mining and also generally accept cryptocurrencies as
payment for services available to customers, such as Cloud Hash Rate, Cloud Hosting, General Hosting
and Membership Hosting. We generally do not hold cryptocurrencies obtained through business operation,
including mining and otherwise, and promptly convert them into fiat currency. The cryptocurrencies held by
us as of December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and June 30, 2022 were US$1.1 million, US$9.6 million, US$6.2 million
and US$3.1 million, respectively and accounted for 1.2%, 5.2%, 1.6% and 1.7% of our total revenue in the
corresponding periods. The table below shows the type and amount of digital assets held as of the end of

We generally use service provided by Matrix Finance and Technologies Holding Group and its
subsidiaries (“Matrixport Group”) for cryptocurrencies custody purpose. Please see the section entitled “-
Our Cryptocurrencies Storage and Custodial Practices” below for more details on the related procedures in
this regard.
Prior to June 30, 2021, we did not leverage cryptocurrencies that we held, including Bitcoin, to generate
additional income, through lending, hedging or otherwise, nor did we convert our fiat currencies into
cryptocurrencies for the same purposes. In the second half of 2021, we explored new options, such as short-
term cryptocurrency lending and purchase of short-term wealth management products using
cryptocurrencies converted from our fiat currencies, in addition to direct deposits of fiat currencies at fixed
rates, in order to optimize our cash management cycle and generate a higher return on cash not otherwise
used in our operating activities. Specifically, during the second half of 2021, we lent 30 million USDC, which
we converted from our fiat currencies, to Matrixport Group at a fixed annual interest rate of 8.25% and
received approximately US$0.7 million interest income; we also converted our fiat currencies into 30 million
USDT and purchased a short-term wealth management product in the same amount from Matrixport Group.
The wealth management product was an unsecured USDT fund offered by Matrixport Group at variable rates
of return, and we received approximately US$0.7 million investment income from such product in the second
half of 2021. Both the loan and the wealth management product were fully redeemed and collected by the end
of 2021. In addition, because we generally do not hold cryptocurrencies, while the incomes we received were
initially in cryptocurrencies, they were promptly converted into fiat currencies following receipt. During the
six months ended June 30, 2022, we lent loans in a total amount of approximately US$50.0 million to
Matrixport Group and received approximately US$0.4 million interest income. We also purchased wealth
management products in a total amount of approximately US$150.0 million from Matrixport Group and
received approximately US$0.3 million in return. Both the loans and the wealth management products were
fully collected and redeemed as of June 30, 2022. To date, we have not experienced, either directly or
indirectly, prohibitions from redeeming or withdrawing crypto assets. All of our cryptocurrency loans and
cryptocurrency wealth management products had been fully redeemed by December 2022, and we do not
anticipate to actively participate in such activities in the foreseeable future.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we do not have any outstanding cryptocurrency
lending to Matrixport Group or any outstanding wealth management product purchased from Matrixport
Group or otherwise. All lending or wealth management products previously purchased from Matrixport Group
had been fully collected or redeemed by the end of December 2022. In light of recent concerns over the lack
of regulations with regards to digital asset based products in general, we do not anticipate entering into any
digital asset based lending or wealth management products with Matrixport Group or otherwise in the
foreseeable future.
We are open to more options to generate additional income by leveraging our cryptocurrencies and fiat
currencies in the future; however, we prioritize our operating activities in terms of cash usage and will ensure
that our cash, short-term investment and anticipated proceeds from disposal of cryptocurrencies in
connection with our principal business will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated working capital
requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 18 months from the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Therefore, we currently do not expect to actively expand our cryptocurrency lending
and investing activities, and may engage in fewer such activities depending on various factors, including
aforementioned cash reserve and anticipated working capital requirements. We monitor our investments
closely and limit our exposure to the investment risk by including in our operation strategy the requirements
to invest only in robust wealth management products and the investments need to be redeemed within the
same fiscal quarter.
We will evaluate each digital asset in our portfolio, or that we propose to hold or acquire in the future,
to determine whether it would likely be considered a security as defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities
Act and consequences thereof, in consultation with outside counsel, as applicable at the time. We will base
our analysis on relevant case law, applying the frameworks established by the U.S. Supreme Court and taking
into consideration relevant guidance by the SEC and its staff, including the SEC’s “Framework for
‘Investment Contract’ Analysis of Digital Assets” issued by the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial
Technology. Prior to holding or acquiring any digital assets, we would undertake customary due diligence
regarding the digital asset in order to gather facts necessary to make such a determination.
However, such framework adopted by us to determine whether certain digital assets are “securities”
involves risk-based judgements by us, is not based on a legal standard or determination binding on any
regulatory body, and therefore is inherently associated with a number of risks. As of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, with the exception of certain centrally issued digital assets that have received “no-
action” letters from the SEC staff, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only digital assets which senior officials at
the SEC have publicly stated are unlikely to be considered securities. However, such statements are not
official policy statements by the SEC and reflect only the speakers’ views, which are not binding on the SEC
or any other agency or court and cannot be generalized to any other digital asset. It is possible that a change
in the governing administration or the appointment of new SEC commissioners could substantially impact
the views of the SEC and its staff.
Thus a particular digital asset’s status as a “security” in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high
degree of uncertainty and if a regulator disagrees with our characterization of a digital asset, we may be
subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect our
business, operating results and financial condition. Current and future legislation and SEC-rulemaking and
other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the
manner in which Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are viewed or treated for classification and clearing
purposes. In particular, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may not be excluded from the definition of
“security” by SEC rulemaking or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions unless another
exemption is available, including transacting in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies among owners and
requiring registration of trading platforms as “exchanges.” It will then likely become difficult or impossible
for the digital asset to be traded, cleared or custodied in the United States through the same channels used
by non-security digital assets, which in addition to materially and adversely affecting the trading value of
the digital asset is likely to cause substantial volatility and significantly impact its liquidity and market
participants’ ability to convert the digital asset into U.S. dollars.
For a more comprehensive discussion of the relevant risks, please see the sections entitled “Risk
Factors - Risks Related to Bitdeer - Risks Related to Cryptocurrencies - There is no one unifying principle
governing the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies nor whether cryptocurrencies are securities in any
particular context. Regulatory changes or actions in one or more countries may alter the nature of an

investment in Bitdeer or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, such as cryptocurrencies, in a manner that
adversely affects Bitdeer’s business, prospects or operations” and “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Bitdeer -
Risks Related to Cryptocurrencies - If Bitdeer were deemed an ‘investment company’ under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for Bitdeer to continue its
business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer’s business.”
Our Cryptocurrencies Storage and Custodial Practices
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022,
substantially all of our cryptocurrencies were held in custody by Matrixport Group and our disposal of
cryptocurrencies, at spot price on the date of disposal, was primarily to Matrixport Group, a related party.
Following our separation from BitMain Technologies Holding Company, we entered into two custody
agreements with Matrixport Group on February 10, 2021 through our subsidiaries, pursuant to which we
appointed Matrixport Group to (i) establish a custody account for the deposit of cryptocurrencies to be held
by Matrixport Group on our behalf, and (ii) act as the custodian of the cryptocurrencies that are delivered to
the designated blockchain address under our custody accounts. For more information, please see the section
entitled “Risk Factors - Bitdeer may not have adequate sources of recovery if the cryptocurrencies held it us
are lost, stolen or destroyed due to third-party cryptocurrencies custodial services or if Bitdeer cannot
redeem or withdraw its cryptocurrencies invested in crypto lending or investing activities. Such incidents
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Our custody accounts in Matrixport Group are protected by username, password, and hardware tokens.
We are able to view the assets in the custody account and relevant transfers via Matrixport Group’s custody
system. We are able to receive, withdraw and dispose of cryptocurrencies with the custody account. Each
withdrawal request is subject to verification by a person designated by us, and if withdrawal is up to certain
limit, to additional verification procedure applied by Matrixport Group, including calling a separately
designated person or requesting additional written confirmation. We note that Matrixport Group offers a
robust security infrastructure designed to safeguard its custody clients from crypto fraud. The generation
and storage of, and the transaction signing by, the private keys are all under encryption in hardware security
modules (HSMs) that provide tamper evidence, tamper resistance and tamper responsiveness features to
safeguard the private keys and make sure no staff of Matrixport Group or anyone can have access to plain
text of private keys. In extreme cases, private keys can be recovered by Matrixport Group’s disaster recovery
measure. Private keys have been sharding into eight pieces that will be stored in an encrypted hard disk
which will then be kept in physical safe deposit boxes in different banks. These sharding pieces are
accessible only to certain qualified employees of Matrixport Group, who must obtain prior permission and
must follow “Segregation of Duty and Least Knowledge Principle” under which such employees have right
to recover the private keys but no right to trigger the withdrawal function from customers’ designated
accounts. All crypto transactions will be monitored by Matrixport Group’s central security system. If an
unusual transaction is identified, an alert will be issued to the relevant customer in real time for transaction
verification purposes.
All withdrawal and transfer of assets shall be permitted by applicable laws and regulations and
Matrixport Group’s internal policies and procedures. Matrixport Group is obligated to keep and maintain, or
cause to be kept, accurate books and records with respect to any custody account and assets in accordance
with applicable law. Statements of assets, along with a ledger of receipts and disbursements of assets is
available to us via Matrixport Group’s custody system. Under the custody agreements, we are obligated to
pay to Matrixport custody fees as a percentage of the value of the cryptocurrencies in U.S. Dollars under
custody, monthly management fees as negotiated, and withdrawal fees if applicable. We incurred
approximately US$0.3 million and US$0.08 million service fees, respectively, including primarily custody fees,
to Matrixport Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022, while the
service fees we paid to Matrixport Group for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 were immaterial.
Our Proprietary Mining Datacenters
We have built and currently operate three proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and two
in Norway with an aggregate electricity capacity of 522MW in use as of June 30, 2022. We have initiated the
expansion of our existing mining datacenters and had achieved access to a total electricity capacity of
775MW by the end of 2022 and 1,374MW thereafter. The locations of our mining datacenters in use, under
construction and “in the pipeline” are illustrated in the diagram below.

and Tydal municipality (Tydal mining datacenter), Norway became operational in December 2019 and
had 38MW electricity capacity in use as of June 30, 2022. We had added 26MW and 50MW of
electricity capacity to each of the two mining datacenters by the end of 2022 from the upgrade of the
two facilities. Additionally, we plan to add additional 400MW of electricity capacity from the
expansion of facilities of the mining datacenter in Tydal, Norway.
Tennessee Mining Datacenter. Our mining datacenter in Knoxville, Tennessee became operational in
May 2020 and we had 86MW electricity capacity in use as of June 30, 2022.
Washington Mining Datacenter. Our mining datacenter in Pangborn, Washington became operational in
May 2018 and we had 13MW electricity capacity in use as of June 30, 2022.
We have accumulated knowledge and expertise in the global landscape of electric power supply, which
enables us to select prime locations to construct mining datacenters. We are currently exploring other sites
for constructions of our mining datacenters with an initial focus on North American, North Europe, Central
Asia and Southeast Asia.
Agreements Related to Our Proprietary Mining Datacenters
Lease Agreement for the Mining Datacenter in Rockdale, Texas

TABLE OF CONTENTS
lease land, certain buildings and improvements on the land, a certain portion of Alcoa’s power delivery
network (“PUN”) and the non-exclusive right to use certain common areas in Rockdale Texas, for the
operation of a blockchain data processing software and hardware center (“Data Center”) as well as the office
use and a technology repair facility related to the Data Center. Alcoa sells and conveys to us a 100%
ownership interest in a certain PUN power circuit and the associated downstream components, subject to
certain power delivery restrictions. Upon termination of the Lease Agreement, our interest and ownership in
the PUN will revert to Alcoa. For the period from June 6, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we paid Alcoa a
lump sum rent of US$250,000. In 2019 and the six months ended June 30, 2020, we paid US$2,400,000 and
US$2,125,000 rent to Alcoa under the Lease Agreement. We have an option to extend the term of this lease
for two successive periods of five years (each such period an “Extension Term”). If applicable, on each
January 1 during the Extension Term, the annual fixed rent shall increase by the greater of 2.5% or the
percentage of the change in the CPI, not to exceed 5% in any single year between the first month and the
eleventh month during the previous year.
Land Lease Agreement for the Molde Mining Datacenter in Fræna Municipality, Norway
On November 15, 2019, we entered into a land lease agreement with Troll Housing AS through Norway
Hash Technologies AS, our subsidiary, as amended by three addenda (i.e., Addendum 1, Addendum 2 and
Addendum 3) we entered into on December 6, 2020, March 22, 2021 and March 22, 2021, respectively,
pursuant to which we lease land located at Klempertåsvegen 1, 6440 Elnesvågen, Norway to support our
Molde mining datacenter with 67MW capacity. For the existing 30MW specified in Addendum 1, land rent is
calculated based on the installed capacity of datacenter, with a unit price of NOK0.01 per kW prior to
January 1, 2021 and NOK0.02 per kW starting from January 1, 2021. For the subsequent expansion of 37MW
specified in Addendum 2 and the future potential expansions referred to in Addendum 3, the land rent is
invoiced monthly and comprises two components, Monthly Rent 1 and Monthly Rent 2. Monthly Rent 1 is
calculated based on datacenter capacity, with a fixed unit price of NOK0.0060 per kWh. Monthly Rent 2 is

Vacant Land Purchase and Sale Agreement for the Mining Datacenter in Pangborn, Washington
On August 3, 2017, we entered into a vacant land purchase and sale agreement with Blackhawk
Development Inc through Antcreek, LLC, our subsidiary, pursuant to which we purchased from Blackhawk
Development Inc a tract of land of 3 acres located at BLA of Parent Parcel 93700000002, East Wenatchee, WA
98802 for a consideration of US$400,000. We use the land to support the operation of our mining datacenter
in Pangborn, Washington.
Energy
We have built, and will continue to make significant investment in building strong partnerships with
local electricity experts and power enterprises. Through these partnerships, we successfully lowered the
average electricity cost of our proprietary mining datacenters to US$40/MWh for the year ended December
31, 2021, which was significantly below the estimated global average of US$49/MWh during the same period,
according to Frost & Sullivan. We entered into electric power supply agreements with electricity suppliers to
secure low electricity costs for our mining datacenters in Rockdale, Texas, and in Norway.
We consider environmental protection vitally important and have implemented measures in the
operation of our business, in particular mining datacenters, to ensure our compliance with all applicable laws
and regulations in the United States, Norway and other applicable jurisdictions. Our hash rate expansion
strategy is energy conscious. We constantly monitor the operation of our mining machines and replace old
mining machines models with new ones periodically to optimize energy efficiency. As a result, we
successfully lowered our average energy consumption from 47.3j/T as of December 31, 2020 to 39.2j/T as of
December 31, 2021 and further to 36j/T as of June 30, 2022. Through years of experience in and deep insight
into the global power supply market, we are able to discover outstanding mining construction resources that
are both cost-efficient and environmentally friendly.
We stick with high environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and constantly increase the
ratio of power supply generated from carbon-free energy. The ratio of our carbon-free power supply reached
approximately 53% as of June 30, 2022, and is expected to increase to approximately 64% upon completing
the construction of all mining datacenters “in the pipeline”. The ratio of our carbon-free power supply, as
used herein, represents the weighted average ratio of carbon-free power supply at our datacenters,
weighting in the respective electricity capacity at each datacenter. To be more specific, it is calculated by
dividing (x) the sum of ratio of carbon-free power supply multiple by electricity capacity at each of our
datacenters, by (y) the total electricity capacity contributed by all our datacenters.
According to the latest available statistics regarding energy structure of power supply from respective
local authorities or suppliers as of June 30, 2022, (i) the power supply in our mining datacenter in Pangborn,
Washington was 100% carbon-free, almost entirely supported by hydroelectric resources, (ii) the power
supply in our mining datacenters in Molde and Tydal, Norway was 100% carbon-free, primarily supported by
wind and hydroelectric resources, (iii) the power supply in our mining datacenter in Rockdale, Texas was
approximately 46% carbon-free, supported by clean energy resources such as wind, nuclear, solar and
hydroelectric, as well as traditional energy resources such as gas and coal, and (iv) the power supply in our
mining datacenter in Knoxville, Tennessee was approximately 60% carbon-free, supported by clean energy
resources, such as unclear, hydroelectric and solar, as well as traditional energy resources such as clean-
burning natural gas units. To further improve the ratio of our carbon-free power supply, we intend to engage
a carbon offset strategy consultant to formulate a carbon emissions offsetting plan for our mining
datacenters in Texas.
Sales and Marketing
Historically, we attracted and retained our customers by offering high-quality products and services,
without heavily relying on online or offline advertising campaigns to promote the sales of our products and
209 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
services. The quality of our products and services is demonstrated by the 100% continuous hash rate online
rate and minimum customer complaints.
Technologies
We stay at the forefront of technology development and have built prominent research and
development capabilities. We benefit from our continuous investment in research and development as well as
our strong and expanding research and development talent pool. Our core technical team has an average of
over eight years of experience in major market players in the cryptocurrency industry. We have obtained
patents to support key technologies underpinning our operations.
Our technology capabilities drive the differentiation of our business. In particular, the following
technologies enable us to constantly improve our proprietary mining efficiency, offer differentiated and
quality products and services, and minimize impacts to the environment.
Hash rate slicing. We supply our customers the subscribed amount of hash rate by first dividing hash
rate into “time slices,” each encompasses a certain number of calculations over a period of time.
Through hash rate slicing, hash rate is divided into “time slices” by algorithm instead of by manual
intervention and then submitted to multiple mining pool accounts to support multiple users. Our
ability to generate a minimum hash rate unit of 1TH/s enables us to adjust hash rate allocation
accurately and dynamically, and optimize operating metrics automatically in order to minimize
fluctuations in terms of quantum in hash rate supply under Cloud Hash Rate.
Hash rate scheduling. We are able to achieve redeployment of hash rate across different mining
machines through hash rate scheduling. When a single machine fails, hash rate from other mining
machines can be instantly dispatched to ensure timing stability of hash rate supply. As a result, we
are able to maintain a hash rate online rate of 100% under Cloud Hash Rate.
Real-time monitoring. Minerplus supports efficient and constant monitoring, automated operation and
maintenance as well as data analysis for mining machines of different models under different brands,
located in mining datacenters of different sizes in different locations. We have developed a highly
efficient monitoring model adopting a procedure of prediction - feature analysis - data processing - 
reverse operation, which is able to accurately identify and quickly scan the monitored objects, and
return operating data of the mining machine in real-time.
Clean energy. We have taken various measures to increase the ratio of clean energy in support of the
operations of our mining datacenters. As of June 30, 2022, our non-carbon energy supply ratio
reached approximately 53%. Our research and development team has started the feasibility
assessment of the use of solar power to support our mining datacenters. We have also spent
considerable efforts in minimizing the impact on the local environment. For example, instead of
building new plants from the ground, we renovated Panasonic’s abandoned plants and Alcoa’s
deserted aluminum smelter plants when constructing our mining datacenters in Tennessee and Texas.
See the section entitled ‘‘- Energy” above for more details.
Competition
For our proprietary mining business, we compete with mining operations throughout the world. We
compete to solve new blocks on the basis of our total number of mining machines, the degree of mining
difficulty and the efficiency of our mining. We also compete to acquire new mining machines, to obtain
access to facilities and prime location of mining operations, to electricity, to develop or acquire new
technologies and to raise capital.
For our hash rate sharing business line, we compete on both the quantity and the quality of our hash
rate supply, which depends on our mining datacenter resources, the total number of our mining machines,
our ability to involve third-party hash rate suppliers and our access to technologies to maintain hash rate
supply stability. We achieved a 37.4% market share as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate
sharing market, which is defined as a market where players sell part of their hash rate to customers, as of
June 30, 2022, according to Frost & Sullivan. While we face competition from hash rate suppliers like
FROGBT, we also seek cooperation with these third-party hash rate suppliers and build synergy-generating
relationships by
210 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
introducing them to our Hash Rate Marketplace and connecting them to our hash rate users. Together with
other market players, we make available diverse and quality hash rate products on our Hash Rate
Marketplace, facilitate the growth of our user base, and both third-party hash rate suppliers and ourselves
can enjoy the faster cash payback enabled by a thriving Hash Rate Marketplace.
For our hosting service, we compete with other hosting operations globally. Our competitiveness
depends on our ability to supply hosting space and power, our deployment, management and operation
capabilities, the value of our service offering to customers, the availability of mining equipment and
technologies, etc. Our innovative computing and hosting service “group-buying” model under Cloud
Hosting gives us a clear advantage. We also enjoy the first-mover advantage in mining datacenter
deployment and operation as well as mining machine management.
We operate in highly competitive industries for cryptocurrency mining and related services. Our
competitors include Argo Blockchain PLC, Bit Digital, Inc., Bitcoin Investment Trust, Bitfarms Technologies
Ltd., Blockchain Industries, Inc, Cipher Mining Inc., Coinbase, Inc., Core Scientific, Inc., Digihost
International, Inc., DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc., DPW Holdings, Inc., HashChain Technology, Inc., Hive
Blockchain Technologies Inc., Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc., Hut 8 Mining Corp., Layer1
Technologies, Inc., Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc., MGT Capital Investments, Inc., Northern Data AG,
Overstock.com Inc., Riot Blockchain, Inc. and TeraWulf Inc. Many of our competitors are well-known
worldwide players and we face competitors that are larger than us and have advantages over us in terms of
economies of scale and financial and other resources. Some of our competitors may also have stronger brand
names, greater access to capital, longer histories, longer relationships with their suppliers or customers and
more resources than we do. Furthermore, these competitors may be able to adapt to changes in the industry
more promptly and efficiently. As such, we expect that competition in our markets will continue to be intense.
Intellectual Property
As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we owned eight registered patents, 10 registered
copyrights, 114 registered trademarks and 171 registered domain names. We are also in the process of
applying for six registered patents. The protection of our intellectual property and all corresponding rights
throughout the world, including our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos, trade names, domain
names, goodwill, patents, copyrights, works of authorship (whether or not copyrightable), software and
trade secrets, know-how, and proprietary and other confidential information, together with all applications,
registrations, renewals, extensions, improvements and counterparts in connection with any of the foregoing,
is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by filing
applications in various patent, trademark and other government offices, and relying on applicable laws and
regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We have
routinely entered into confidentiality and invention disclosure and assignment agreements with our
employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with external parties with whom we conduct
business to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.
Employees
As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we had 160 full-time employees, and one part-time
employee. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining
agreement. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not
experienced any material disputes with our employees in our history.
Seasonality
Our hash rate level is typically slightly lower in summer as temperature affects mining machine
performance regarding hash rate generation.
Government Regulation
Due to the relatively short history of cryptocurrencies, and their emergence as a new asset class,
government regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with increased interest
expressed by U.S. and internal regulators. For example, the Cyber-Digital Task Force of the U.S. Department
211 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Justice published a report entitled “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework” in October 2020 that
detailed the Department’s view with respect to cryptocurrencies and the tools at the Department’s disposal
to deal with threats posed by cryptocurrencies. In March 2021, the nominee for Chair of the SEC expressed
the need for investor protection along with promotion of innovation in the cryptocurrency space.
Government regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is under active consideration by the United
States federal government via its agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as by similar entities in other
countries and transnational organizations, such as the European Union. State and local regulations also may
apply to our activities and other activities in which we may participate in the future. Other governmental or
semi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies
engaged in blockchain or cryptocurrency businesses. For instance, the SEC has taken an active role in
regulating the use of public offerings of proprietary coins (so-called “initial coin offerings”) and has made
statements and official promulgations as to the status of certain cryptocurrencies as “securities” subject to
regulation by the SEC.
The effect of any regulatory change, either by the Federal, state, local or foreign governments or any
self-regulatory agencies on us is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we are unaware
of significant adverse governmental or regulatory action adverse to Bitcoin or Ethereum mining in the United
States, there is no guarantee that future regulation or adverse action will not take place and interpretation of
existing regulations in a manner adverse to our business is possible.
In addition, various foreign jurisdictions either have adopted, or may adopt, laws, regulations or
directives that affect cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency networks, and their users and participants. Such laws,
regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States, may negatively impact the acceptance
of cryptocurrencies by users, merchants and service providers outside of the United States, and may
therefore impede the growth of cryptocurrencies. A number of Eastern European and Asian countries
currently have a more restrictive stance toward cryptocurrencies and, thereby, have reduced the rate of
expansion of cryptocurrency use, as well as cryptocurrency transaction processing, in each of those
countries. Presently, we do not believe any U.S. or State regulatory body has taken any action or position
adverse to our main cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, with respect to its production, sale, and use as a medium of
exchange; however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations may affect our
business in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability.
As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further
regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities.
Facilities
Our principal executive offices are located at #09-03/04, Aperia Tower 1, 8 Kallang Avenue, Singapore
339509, where we lease an approximately 440 square meters facility. This facility houses our administrative
headquarters and research and development center. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and
adequate to meet our current needs. If we need to add new facilities or expand existing facilities as we add
employees, we believe that suitable additional space will be available to accommodate any such expansion of
our operations.
Legal Proceedings
We are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. We have been, and may
from time to time in the future, be subject to various legal and administrative proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of our business. Such claims or legal actions, even if without merit, could result in the
expenditure of significant financial and management resources and potentially result in civil liability for
damages.

Employment Agreements and Indemnification Agreements
BTG has entered into employment agreements with each of BTG’s executive officers. Under these
agreements, each of BTG’s executive officers is employed for a specified time period. BTG may terminate
employment for cause, at any time, for certain acts of the executive officer, such as continued failure by the
executive officer to satisfactorily perform his/her duties, or the executive officer’s conviction or entry of a
guilty or nolo contendere plea of any felony or any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. BTG may also
terminate an executive officer’s employment without cause upon 60-day advance written notice. In such case
of termination by BTG, BTG will (i) continue to provide to the executive officer all compensation, base salary
and previously earned but unpaid incentive compensation, if any, and to allow the executive officer to
participate in any benefit plans in accordance with the terms of such plans during the notice period, and (ii)
pay to the executive officer, in lieu of benefits under any severance plan or policy of BTG, any such amount
as may be agreed between BTG and the executive officer.
Each executive officer has agreed to hold, both during and after the termination or expiry of his or her
employment agreement, in strict confidence and not to use, except as required in the performance of his or
her duties in connection with the employment or pursuant to applicable law, any of BTG’s confidential
information or trade secrets, any confidential information or trade secrets of BTG’s clients or prospective
clients, or the confidential or proprietary information of any third party received by BTG and for which BTG
has confidential obligations. The executive officers have also agreed to disclose in confidence to BTG all
inventions, designs and trade secrets which they conceive, develop or reduce to practice during the
executive officer’s employment with BTG and to assign all rights, title and interest in them to BTG, and assist
BTG in obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and other legal rights for these inventions, designs and
trade secrets.
In addition, each executive officer has agreed to be bound by non-competition and non-solicitation
restrictions during the term of his or her employment and typically for one year following the last date of
employment. Specifically, each executive officer has agreed not to (i) engage in, or otherwise directly or
indirectly being employed by or acting as a consultant or lender to, or being a director, officer, employee,
principal, agent, stockholder, member, owner or partner of, or permitting the executive officer’s name to be
used in connection with the activities of, any other business or organization which competes, directly or
indirectly, with BTG; (ii) solicit from any customer doing business with BTG during the term; or (iii) otherwise
interfere with the business or accounts of BTG.
BTG has also entered into indemnification agreements with each of BTG’s directors and executive
officers. Under these agreements, BTG agrees to indemnify BTG’s directors and executive officers against
certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by reason of their
being a director or officer of BTG.
Foreign Private Issuer Status
BTG is an exempted company limited by shares incorporated in 2021 under the laws of the Cayman
Islands. After the consummation of the Business Combination, BTG will report under the Exchange Act as a
non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status. Under Rule 405 of the Securities Act, the determination
218 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer’s most recently
completed second fiscal quarter and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to BTG on
June 30, 2022. For so long as BTG qualifies as a foreign private issuer, it will be exempt from certain
provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including:
the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current
reports on Form 8-K with the SEC;
the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in
respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;
the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and
trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and
the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation Fair
Disclosure, or Regulation FD, which regulates selective disclosure of material non-public information
by issuers.
BTG will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal
year. In addition, BTG intends to publish its results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed
pursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases relating to financial results and material
events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information BTG is required to file with
or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC
by U.S. domestic issuers. Accordingly, after the Business Combination, BTG shareholders will receive less or
different information about BTG than a shareholder of a U.S. domestic public company would receive.
BTG is a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status, and, after the consummation of the
Business Combination, will be listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq market rules permit a foreign private issuer like BTG
to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country. Certain corporate governance practices in
the Cayman Islands, which is BTG’s home country, may differ significantly from Nasdaq corporate
governance listing standards. Among other things, BTG is not required to have:
a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;
a compensation committee consisting of independent directors;
a nominating committee consisting of independent directors; or
regularly scheduled executive sessions with only independent directors each year.
Although not required and as may be changed from time to time, BTG intends to have, as of the
consummation of the Business Combination, a majority-independent board of directors, a majority-
independent compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to the foregoing, BTG intends to
rely on the exemptions listed above. As a result, you may not be provided with the benefits of certain
corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq applicable to U.S. domestic public companies.
Controlled Company Status
After the completion of the Business Combination, Mr. Jihan Wu will control a majority of the voting
power of BTG’s outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, BTG will be a “controlled company” within the
meaning of applicable Nasdaq listing rules. Under these corporate governance standards, a company of
which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a
“controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including
the requirements (1) that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) that its
board of directors have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a
written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and (3) that its board of directors
have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors
with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities. BTG expects to utilize these
“controlled company” exemptions for at least some period following the Business Combination, as it does
not expect its board of directors, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance
committee following the Business Combination to meet the afore-mentioned independence requirements.
Pending such determination, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies
that are subject
219 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to all of these corporate governance requirements. If BTG ceases to be a “controlled company” and its
shares continue to be listed on Nasdaq, BTG will be required to comply with these standards and, depending
on the board’s independence determination with respect to its then-current directors, BTG may be required
to add additional directors to its board in order to achieve such compliance within the applicable transition
periods.
Director Independence
As a result of Mr. Jihan Wu holding a majority of the voting power of BTG’s outstanding ordinary
shares, BTG will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq’s listing rules. Therefore, BTG will
not be required to comply with certain corporate governance rules that would otherwise apply to us as a
listed company on Nasdaq, including the requirement that compensation committee and nominating and
corporate governance committee be composed entirely of “independent” directors (as defined by Nasdaq’s
listing rules). As a “controlled company,” the board of directors of BTG will not be required to include a
majority of “independent” directors.
Nonetheless, we anticipate that BTG will have three “independent directors” as defined in the Nasdaq
listing standards and applicable SEC rules. In addition, we anticipate that Guang Yang, Sheldon Trainor-
DeGirolamo and Naphat Sirimongkolkasem will qualify as independent directors for the purpose of serving
on the audit committee of BTG under SEC rules.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
BTG has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to its directors, officers and
employees. BTG seeks to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. BTG’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets out the principles designed to guide BTG’s
business practices - compliance, integrity, respect and dedication. The code applies to all directors, officers,
employees and extended workforce, including the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Operating Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief People Officer. Relevant sections of the code
also apply to members of the BTG board of directors. BTG expects its suppliers, contractors, consultants,
and other business partners to follow the principles set forth in its code when providing goods and services
to BTG or acting on BTG’s behalf.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations together with the “Selected Historical Financial Information of Bitdeer” section of this
prospectus and our combined and consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing
elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set

statement/prospectus, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-
looking statements.
Overview
Bitdeer is a world-leading technology company for the cryptocurrency mining community. As of June
30, 2022, we were the world’s second largest holder of proprietary hash rate, which is defined as hash rate
generated from proprietary mining machines; by allocating part of our proprietary hash rate for sale, we were
the world’s largest supplier of hash rate, as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing
market, which is defined as a market where players sell part of their hash rate to customers, according to
Frost & Sullivan.
We mine cryptocurrencies for our own account and serve the cryptocurrency mining community by
providing innovative, reliable and easy-to-use cryptocurrency mining solutions. Headquartered in
Singapore, we currently operate five proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and Norway with an
aggregate electricity capacity of 522MW as of June 30, 2022, which we had increased to 775MW by the end
of 2022 by expanding our footprints to six mining datacenters globally. From these mining datacenters, we
generate managing hash rate which is categorized into proprietary and hosting hash rate. As of June 30,
2022, our proprietary hash rate reached 4.2 EH/s and accounted for 1.8% of the total Bitcoin network hash
rate, making us the second largest holder of proprietary hash rate across the globe, according to Frost &
Sullivan. Together with the 6.3 EH/s hosting hash rate generated from mining machines hosted in our mining
datacenters, we possessed a total of 10.5 EH/s of managing hash rate as of June 30, 2022, accounting for
approximately 4.6% of the total Bitcoin network hash rate.
To date, we primarily operate three business lines - “proprietary mining,” “hash rate sharing” and
“hosting.” Proprietary mining refers to cryptocurrency mining for our own account, which allows us to
directly capture the high appreciation potential of cryptocurrency. We offer two types of hash rate sharing
solutions, Cloud Hash Rate and Hash Rate Marketplace. Through Cloud Hash Rate, we sell our proprietary
hash rate to customers. We offer hash rate subscription plans at fixed price and share mining income with
them under certain arrangements. As of June 30, 2022, our Cloud Hash Rate business achieved a market
share of 37.4% as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing market, according to Frost &
Sullivan. Through Hash Rate Marketplace, we connect reliable third-party hash rate suppliers with hash rate
users to facilitate hash rate sales and generate revenue from charging service fees. Our hosting services
offer customers one-stop mining machine hosting solutions encompassing deployment, maintenance and
management services for efficient cryptocurrency mining. Among a wide selection of hosting services,
customers can either subscribe to our Cloud Hosting service for the specified mining machines from which
they derive computing power under a “group-buying” model, or send their mining machines to our mining
datacenters for hosting under the General Hosting option or the Membership Hosting option. Historically,
our hosting hash rate were generated from Cloud Hosting and General Hosting. All of our three business
lines are supported by Minerplus, our self-developed integrated intelligent software platform, which offers
software support to significantly reduce time needed for daily maintenance and mining machine upgrade and
substantially decrease operation and maintenance headcount. We source mining machines from a wide
variety of manufacturers and traders with whom we have built robust relationships over the years. We also
engage in the sales of mining machines from time to time.
221 TABLE OF CONTENTS
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022,
respectively, 42.2%, 47.5%, 48.6%, 50.7% and 22.8% of our revenue was generated from proprietary mining,
and 49.0%, 42.0%, 31.5%, 28.2% and 41.7% of our revenue was generated from Cloud Hash Rate. For the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, 1.6%, 1.9%, 2.7%
and 3.8% of our revenue was generated from Cloud Hosting, a new service launched in 2020. We also
launched General Hosting in 2021, which contributed 4.6%, 0.4% and 29.5% of our total revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022. We generated immaterial revenue
from Hash Rate Marketplace and no revenue from Membership Hosting prior to June 30, 2022. For the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, 8.5%,
8.5%, 11.6%, 17.2% and 0.2% of our revenue was generated from the sales of mining machines.
We have historically achieved significant growth in recent periods. Our revenue increased by 110.0%
from US$88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$186.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2020, and further increased by 111.7% to US$394.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the
first six months in 2022, we generated US$179.6 million in total net revenue, as compared to US$219.7 million
generated for the first six months in 2021. We had gross loss of US$10.1 million and US$23.2 million for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and generated gross profit of US$241.4 million,
US$142.8 million and US$69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June
30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We incurred net loss of US$27.9 million, US$55.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2020, respectively, generated net profit of US$113.8 million and US$82.6 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2021, and incurred net loss of US$25.2 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 195.2% from US$16.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and further
increased by 479.2% to US$281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the six months ended
June 30, 2022, our adjusted EBITDA was US$68.2 million, as compared to US$183.2 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2021. However, our recent growth trends may not continue and we may not be able to
maintain or increase our profitability over the long term.
Recent Developments
Recent events impacting our business are as follows:
Business Combination
On December 15, 2021, an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended
from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) was entered into by and among Bitdeer Technologies Group
(“BTG”), Bitdeer, Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (“BSGA”), Blue Safari Merge Limited, a British Virgin
Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“BSGA Merger Sub 1”), Blue Safari
Merge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“BSGA
Merger Sub 2”), Bitdeer Merge Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the
laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“Bitdeer Merger Sub”) and Blue Safari
Mini Corp. (“BSGA Sub”), amending and restating that agreement and plan of merger dated November 18,
2021, by and among Bitdeer, BSGA and BSGA Sub. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) BSGA
Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into BSGA with BSGA being the surviving entity (the “First SPAC
Merger”), (ii) following the First SPAC Merger, BSGA will merge with and into BSGA Merger Sub 2, with
BSGA Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity (the “Second SPAC Merger,” and together with the First
SPAC Merger, the “Initial Mergers”), and (iii) following the Initial Mergers, Bitdeer Merger Sub will merge
with and into Bitdeer (the “Acquisition Merger,” and together with the Initial Mergers, the “Mergers”), with
Bitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG.
On May 30, 2022, parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a First Amendment to Amended and
Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger to extend the termination date upon which either BSGA or Bitdeer
may terminate the Merger Agreement, from May 31, 2022 to September 1, 2022.
On December 2, 2022, parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a Second Amendment to Amended
and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger to further extend the termination date upon which either BSGA
222 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or Bitdeer may terminate the Merger Agreement, from September 1, 2022 to the earlier of (i) June 1, 2023 and
(ii) the then applicable deadline for BSGA to complete a business combination in accordance with BSGA’s
organizational documents.
On March 7, 2023, parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a Third Amendment to Amended and
Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger to revise the definition of “Per Share Equity Value” to the quotient
obtained by dividing (i) US$1,180,000,000 by (ii) Bitdeer Total Shares. The parties also agreed to remove the
previously contemplated American Depository Share structure and instead issue ordinary shares of BTG as
considerations to be paid.
The Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are collectively referred to
as the “Business Combination.” The consummation of the Business Combination remains subject to
customary closing conditions.
Reorganization
Separation from BitMain Technologies Holding Company
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the period from January 1, 2021 to January 26,
2021, the Cloud Hash Rate business, the proprietary mining business and the business of providing dynamic
hosting solutions (collectively, the “Bitdeer Business”), and the mining pool business, including the
ownership of and registration right to the domain name btc.com (the “BTC.com Pool Business” or “BTC”),
were operated through a number of entities controlled by BitMain Technologies Holding Company
(“Bitmain”). We were created for the purpose of separating the Bitdeer Business and the BTC.com Pool
Business following a corporate reorganization of Bitmain in order to effectuate the separation. The
separation from Bitmain resulted in the transfer of certain assets, liabilities and contracts related to the
Bitdeer Business and the BTC.com Pool Business at their historical book values from Bitmain to the
Company on January 26, 2021, when Bitmain distributed by way of dividend in kind the shares of the
Company to the then existing Bitmain shareholders. Immediately after the separation from Bitmain, the
Company and its subsidiaries began operating on a stand-alone basis.
Separation of the BTC.com Pool Business
In February 2021, we established Blockchain Alliance Technologies Holding Company (“Blockchain
Alliance”) for the purpose of separating the BTC.com Pool Business following our corporate reorganization.
The separation was consummated on April 15, 2021, when we distributed by way of dividend in kind the
shares of Blockchain Alliance to our then existing shareholders.
Basis of Preparation
The combined financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and the period from
January 1, 2021 to April 15, 2021 have been prepared to capture the stand-alone Bitdeer Business, which has
historically operated as part of Bitmain. The assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of the BTC.com Pool
Business were also excluded from these financial statements. There are limitations inherent in the preparation
of these financial statements since our business was previously part of a larger organization.
The combined statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss) for the years ended December
31, 2019 and 2020 and the period from January 1, 2021 to April 15, 2021 include all revenue and cost directly
attributable to the Bitdeer Business. These include certain common operating and administrative expense
incurred by the Bitdeer Business in conjunction with other business operations of Bitmain and BTC,
including financial, human resources, office administration and other support functions. These costs have
been allocated on a basis considered reasonable by management using either specific identification or
proportional allocations based on usage, headcount, or other reasonable methods of allocation.
The consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2021, the condensed consolidated
statement of financial position as of June 30, 2022, the consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive income of the Bitdeer Business for the period from April 16, 2021 to June 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2021 and the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the
223 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
six months ended June 30, 2022 are prepared on a consolidated basis. For further information on the basis of
presentation, please refer to Note 2(a) to the combined and consolidated financial statements as of December
31, 2020 and 2021 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and Note 2 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, which are
included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Key Performance Metrics
We regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics presented below, to evaluate our
business and performance.
Hash Rate
We believe hash rate is an important metric for assessing the strength of our business. “Hash rate” is a
measure of computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a PoW blockchain,
such as Bitcoin, representing the number of calculations per second that can be performed. Cryptocurrency
mining is a competitive process in that only the first miner who solves a particular mining puzzle through
numerous calculations can get the mining reward. Accordingly, the more hash rate we possess, as a
percentage of the entire network hash rate for a particular cryptocurrency, the higher possibility we have in
resolving a block on the network blockchain, and hence a greater chance of success in obtaining
cryptocurrency rewards. We calculate and report our hash rate in EH/s. One exahash equals one quintillion
hashes per second. As of June 30, 2022, we possessed proprietary hash rate of 4.2 EH/s, accounting for 1.8%
of the total Bitcoin network hash rate, according to Frost & Sullivan.
Electricity Capacity
Electricity capacity is another key metric to evaluate our business and operation given the energy
intensive nature of cryptocurrency mining. Cryptocurrency mining is conducted through intensive
computations, and the generation of the hash rate used in such computations requires large amounts of
electricity. As a result, the growth of our business, such as proprietary mining and hash rate sales through
Cloud Hash Rate, relies on a sustainable and increasing supply of a significant amount of electricity, which
is currently supported by our proprietary mining datacenters. As of June 30, 2022, our electricity capacity
was 522MW.
Electricity Cost
As our business operations consume a large amount of electricity and electricity cost in operating
mining machines accounts for a significant portion of our overall cost of revenue, we strive to maintain our
leadership position in the global electricity cost curve by building mining datacenters worldwide, where low
electricity cost supports stable operations. As such, we see electricity cost a key indicator of our business
performance. Our premier mining datacenters allowed us to successfully lower the average electricity cost of
our mining datacenters to US$40/MWh for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was significantly below
the estimated global average of US$49/MWh during the same period, according to Frost & Sullivan.
Non-IFRS Financial Measure
In evaluating our business, we consider and use a non-IFRS measure, adjusted EBITDA, as a
supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based
payment expenses under IFRS 2. We present this non-IFRS financial measure because they are used by our
management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. We also believe that the
use of this non-IFRS measure facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance. These
measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result,
you should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, our profit/(loss) for
the periods, as determined in accordance with IFRS.
We compensate for these limitations by reconciling these non-IFRS financial measures to the nearest
IFRS performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We
encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
The following factors are the principal factors that have affected and will continue to affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Price and volatility of Bitcoin
We derive, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of revenue from proprietary mining of
cryptocurrency, primarily Bitcoin. Hence, our ability to generate revenue from this business line is directly
affected by the market price of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price may also impact the use of our mining machines.
Our proprietary mining business breaks even so long as it is economically beneficial for us to continue to
operate our mining machines, and that is essentially when the mining machines contribute positive cash flow
(i.e., when the variable cost to mine one Bitcoin, namely the electricity cost, equals the market price of a
Bitcoin). Based on this overarching principle, our electricity cost to mine one Bitcoin is approximately
US$10,000. Such estimate is based on the following assumptions: (i) the Bitcoin network hash rate remains
239.4EH/s, which was the hash rate as of January 9, 2023, according to Frost & Sullivan; (ii) our average
mining machine energy consumption remains at 35.5j/T, which represents the average mining machine energy
consumption as of November 30, 2022; and (iii) electricity cost remains at US$0.047/ kWh, which represents
our average electricity price in November 2022. The estimate of approximately US$10,000 is essentially the
“shutdown Bitcoin price” for our proprietary mining business, indicating that as long as the Bitcoin price is
higher than US$10,000, we would continue to operate our mining machines and such operation would be
economically beneficial to us.
According to Frost & Sullivan, the Bitcoin price as of December 31, 2022 was US$16,576 per Bitcoin and
the average daily price of Bitcoin in 2022 was approximately US$28,254 per Bitcoin. Hence, we expect our
proprietary mining activities to continue to recoup cash unless the Bitcoin price experiences a drastic drop to
close to half of the current price. See the section entitled “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Bitdeer - Risks
Related to Bitdeer’s Business, Operations, Industry and Financial Condition - Bitdeer’s results of operations
have been and are expected to continue to be significantly impacted by Bitcoin price fluctuation.” In
addition, the depreciation and impairment potential of our mining machines may be affected by the volatility
of the market prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. See the section entitled “- Our ability to procure
mining machines at a lower cost” below. On the other hand, a drop in Bitcoin price may also create an
opportunity for us to add cheaper mining machines to our mining fleets. We also generate a large percentage
of revenue from Cloud Hash Rate, which offers hash rate to be utilized by third-party miners. As a result,
revenue from this business line is also correlated with Bitcoin price and volatility.
The appreciation potential of Bitcoin is high due to several factors. Bitcoins are inherently scarce, given
they are designed to have a finite supply of 21 million associated with a depreciating rewarding mechanism,
225 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
termed “halving,” under which the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is reduced in half every four years.
The growing recognition of Bitcoins also attracts large investment into the Bitcoin economy, as evidenced
by an increasing installed network hash rate of Bitcoin globally, and increasing adoption of Bitcoin as an
investment instrument and a payment method. Further, more countries are establishing clear and robust
regulations to create a more stable environment for Bitcoin mining and trading, which may facilitate the
demand for Bitcoins and Bitcoin price appreciation. The Bitcoin price has soared by 236% from the last peak
at US$20,089 on December 17, 2017 to US$67,562 on November 9, 2021, according to Frost & Sullivan.
However, there are a number of other factors that contribute to changes in Bitcoin price and volatility,
including, but not limited to, Bitcoin market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, utility of Bitcoin, and
idiosyncratic events such as exchange outages or social media. These factors have contributed to the
depreciation of Bitcoin. For example, recent industry-wide developments, including the continued industry-
wide fallout from the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of cryptocurrency exchanges FTX (including its
affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC), crypto hedge fund Three Arrows, crypto miners Compute
North and Core Scientific and crypto lenders Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and BlockFi, have led to a
drop in Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin price has dropped significantly from its last peak on November 9, 2021 to
US$15,986 on November 22, 2022, its lowest point since the last peak.
While we have seen clear growth in both of our proprietary mining and Cloud Hash Rate business, we
have limited ability to predict Bitcoin price and its volatility, which we expect to continue to affect our future
earnings and cash flows.

Our ability to maintain our leadership position in proprietary hash rate
A prevailing strategy to profit from proprietary hash rate is mining. The cryptocurrencies mined can be
sold at a profit when their market value is high enough to cover the cost of mining machines, electricity fees
and other mining-related expenses. Bitcoins are intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult
to mine, rendering hash rate critical in the mining industry. Possessing a higher share of network hash rate
translates to a higher likelihood of generating mining awards.
We strive to maintain our leadership position in proprietary hash rate. In particular, we have established
a business model that allows us to constantly reinforce our market-leading position and outpace our
competitors in terms of scaling up our proprietary hash rate. We strategically allocate a significant amount of
proprietary hash rate to hash rate sales through our Cloud Hash Rate business, to enable instant cash pay-
back upon customers’ subscription to our hash rate plans. We generally generate proceeds from hash rate
sales under long-term hash rate subscription plans that approximate the purchase cost of mining machines.
We are able to achieve such a premium against mining machine purchase cost as our hash rate subscription
plans save hash rate buyers the efforts from complex mining operation and maintenance and have built brand
recognition among customers. Therefore, we are able to continuously grow our proprietary hash rate by
funding the purchase of additional mining fleets with the instant cash collected from hash rate sales using
our existing mining fleets, significantly reducing our pay-back period to one month, compared to the long
pay-back period
226 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
associated with cryptocurrency mining activities, which is typically from 6 to 18 months, according to Frost
& Sullivan. We intend to continuously scale up our infrastructure and proprietary hash rate in this efficient
manner in order to maintain and reinforce our leading position in proprietary hash rate. However, whether we
can achieve a premium through this model depends on various factors, such as the supply and demand in
both mining machines and global mining datacenters, whether miners prefer conducting mining operations
on their own and technology advancements. Short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations is another contributing
factor as quickly adjusting the pricing of our hash rate subscriptions plans to reflect such price change is
difficult, if not impossible. Whether this approach will remain effective will affect our ability to add more
mining fleets to support the scale-up of our infrastructure and hash rate.
Our ability to procure mining machines at a lower cost
Depreciation of mining machines remained one of the few largest costs we incurred in our business
operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and
2022. Depreciation of mining machines is directly affected by the purchase price of these machines.
Along with the increase in market value of cryptocurrencies, the demand for the most recent and
efficient mining machines has also increased, leading to scarcity in the supply of and thereby an increase in
the price of mining machines. As a result, the cost of new machines can be unpredictable, and could also be
significantly higher than our historical cost for new mining machines. Based on our well-established network
with upstream mining machine suppliers and traders, we believe that we are able to secure spot machines for
the most recent and most commonly used models at a relatively low price for a majority of our mining
machines and thereby lowering depreciation of mining machines. On the other hand, a decrease in market
value of cryptocurrencies may present opportunities for us to procure cheaper mining machines. For
example, in light of the recent decrease and volatility of Bitcoin price, we are in the process of establishing a
fund to purchase mining machines from financially distressed miners, if the value and quality of such mining
machines are satisfactory to us.
However, whether we are able to successfully procure mining machines at a low price is subject to a
number of factors, including our brand strength, our mining machine purchase channels, and supply and
demand of mining machines, some of which may not be entirely within our control. Even if we are able to
procure mining machines at a lower cost, the depreciation and impairment potential of our mining machines
may nevertheless be affected by the volatility of the market prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We
may need to reconsider the appropriateness of the current useful life, the residual value and the depreciation
method of our mining machines based on the change in cryptocurrency prices on a yearly or more frequently
basis. In addition to the reassessment of depreciation, we may also need to assess whether any indications
are present which will result in impairments of our mining machines. For example, impairments may be
necessary if the expected operating profits from the mining machines show a significant decline from
previous forecasts, which may be caused if the market price of Bitcoin drops below the mining machine shut-
down price.
Our ability to effectively maintain our leadership position in the global electricity cost curve
Electricity cost was the other largest cost, besides depreciation of mining machines, that we incurred in
our business operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended
June 30, 2021 and 2022.
Our ability to secure ample power supply with low electricity cost is underpinned by our top-notch
global mining datacenters deployment and operation experience and capabilities. We pioneer in deploying
and operating mining datacenters globally. Our dedicated global team for mining datacenter construction
understands the critical needs of mining as well as the complex and continuously evolving global landscape
of electricity supply. They also have extensive connections with local electricity experts and power
enterprises around the world, giving us a clear advantage in mining datacenter construction, and hence in
electricity capacity and electricity costs among our competitors. We were able to optimize our electricity cost
structure and successfully lowered the average electricity cost of our proprietary mining datacenters to
US$40/MWh for the year ended 2021, which was significantly below the estimated global average of
US$49/MWh during the same period, according to Frost & Sullivan. Whether our current cost-saving efforts
or our forward strategy in this regard is effective for maintaining our leadership position in the global
electricity cost curve will affect our ability to control our costs.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Our business judgments regarding pricing strategy and resource allocation
Our business operations involve constant and important decision-making regarding the pricing of our
products and services as well as allocation of mining resources. Our pricing strategy is based on our
estimates of market trends. As we operate three business lines, we have to decide the allocation of
proprietary hash rate between “proprietary mining” and “hash rate sharing” as well as the allocation of
mining datacenter capacity among “proprietary mining”, “hash rate sharing” and “hosting”. While allocating
more mining resources to “hash rate sharing” and “hosting” services may facilitate cash payback and mining
datacenter expansion, we have to forgo Bitcoin’s huge appreciation potential to some extent as we could
earn more Bitcoins by allocating the same mining resources to “proprietary mining”, and vice versa. We
spend great efforts in making decisions in the Company’s best interest, taking into account Bitcoin price,
network hash rate, the amount of cash we need and our view on the market opportunities for acquiring
mining machines or expanding mining datacenters at low cost, etc. However, we cannot guarantee that our
decisions could bring the Company the best results every time, and we anticipate our business judgments
will continue to affect the results of our operations.
Our ability to upgrade and expand our offerings
Crypto-economy is characterized by continuous fluctuations and frequent innovations. Therefore, our
future success is dependent on our ability to diversify our income structure to reduce exposure to
fluctuations of the price of Bitcoin, the most significant type of cryptocurrency involved in our business
operation, and maintain our market-leading position by upgrading and expanding our offerings. We launched
Minerplus in January 2021 to improve operational efficiency for our proprietary mining business and miner
customers. We expect to further expand our hosting service and generate more revenue from the service. We
are in the process of building an efficient hash rate trading marketplace connecting third-party hash rate
suppliers and hash rate buyers. We intend to enrich our product and service portfolio by providing mining
services covering new crypto protocols, including Proof-of-Stake (“PoS”), Delegated Proof-of-Stake
(“DPoS”), Proof-of-Spacetime (“PoSt”) and Proof-of-Capacity (“PoC”), and steadily increase the weight of
new business to diversify revenue streams and attract new customers who are users of these new crypto
protocols.
Although we have accumulated extensive expertise and know-how in the cryptocurrency industry, we
are only at an earlier stage of executing our offering expansion plan. Upgrading existing offerings and
commencing new businesses may incur significant costs and experience a prolonged ramp-up period.
Although we expect these investments to benefit our business over the long term, we also expect our total
operating expenses will increase for the foreseeable future. If any adverse development in such new
businesses arises, we may not be able to develop those new businesses as successfully as contemplated, or
at all, and our results of operations and prospects may be significantly and negatively affected as a result.
Regulatory environment
We are a leading cryptocurrency mining service provider with a strong global presence. As of June 30,
2022, we operate five prime mining datacenters in the United States and Norway and have served users
across over 100 countries and regions around the globe, and may continue to expand our operations to more
countries and regions. Each of our business line is subject to government regulation in each jurisdiction in
which we operate and various jurisdictions may from time to time adopt laws, regulations or directives that
affect our businesses. We are subject to regulatory risks with regards to mining, holding, using, or
transferring cryptocurrencies, etc., and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment and our ability to
anticipate and respond to potential changes in government policies and regulations will have a significant
impact on our business operations in countries we operate in and our overall results of operations.
Regulations have impacted or could impact, among others, the nature of and scope of offerings we are able
to make available, the pricing of offerings on our platform, our relationship with, and incentives, fees and
commissions provided to or charged from our business partners, our ability to operate in certain segments of
our business. We expect that our ability to manage our relationships with regulators in each of our markets,
as well as existing and evolving regulations will continue to impact our results in the future.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020,
and the subsequent restrictive measures including social distancing, quarantine imposed by the
governments
228 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
around the world, and related travel and trade restrictions have caused disruption to businesses and resulted
in significant global economic impacts. COVID-19 has also impacted the payment efficiency of certain of our
customers. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, these impacts have not had a significant effect
on our financial results or operations and liquidity. At present, we are generally conducting business and
operations as usual.
The global impact of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the
situation and the effects on our business and operations closely. We do not yet know the full extent of
potential impacts on our business or operations or on the global economy as a whole, particularly if the
COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time. Given the uncertainty, we cannot
reasonably estimate the impact on our future results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. See the
section entitled “Risk Factors - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a significantly negative impact on the
global economy, industry and market conditions. The ongoing development and the global control on the
pandemic are unclear, which may increase the instability of Bitdeer’s development, materially and adversely
affecting Bitdeer’s results of operations.” for further details.
Key Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate revenue from (i) proprietary mining, (ii) hash rate sales through Cloud Hash Rate, (iii)
Cloud Hosting, (iv) General Hosting, (v) sales of mining machines and (vi) others, which mainly consist of
the provision of management services and the sale of mining machine peripherals. Historically, we only
accepted cryptocurrency for Cloud Hosting. For our other products and services available to customers, we
accept both fiat currency and cryptocurrencies as payment.
Proprietary Mining
We enter into contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power generated from our
own mining machines to the mining pools. The contracts with mining pool operators are terminable at any
time by either party. In exchange for providing computing power to the mining pool, we are entitled to
cryptocurrency rewards from the mining pool operators, which is a variable consideration calculated based
on a predetermined formula agreed by us and the mining pool operator as a part of the arrangement. The
variable consideration is constrained until we can reasonably estimate the amount of mining rewards by the
end of a given day based on the actual amount of computing power provided to the mining pool operators.
By then, we consider it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenues will not occur
and includes such variable consideration in the transaction price. Providing computing power is an output of
our ordinary activities and the only performance obligation in our contracts with mining pool operators. We
recognize the revenue when the variable consideration is no longer constrained and the performance
obligation of providing computing power has been satisfied. As a result, we do not present disaggregated
revenue information on block rewards and transaction verification fees.
Cloud Hash Rate
Through Cloud Hash Rate, customers can subscribe to a specified amount of computing power derived
from the mining machines held by us for a period of time through a wide selection of hash rate subscription
plans offered by us, differentiated by plan duration and the type of cryptocurrency to be mined. By
subscribing to the hash rate subscription plan, the customers are able to direct the computing power
provided by us to be connected to a customer-designated mining pool for a period of time. As a result of
directing the connection of such computing power to the mining pools, the customers are entitled to the
mining rewards, which are directly transferred from mining pools to the customer-designated cryptocurrency
wallets. Customers pay a fixed amount for the subscribed hash rate at the commencement of the plans. The
revenue related to hash rate subscriptions is amortized ratably throughout the duration of the plan. The
customer also needs to separately pay for electricity subscriptions to maintain the mining machines that
produce the subscribed hash rate. The revenue related to electricity subscriptions is recognized ratably
throughout the duration of each respective electricity subscription. The price of electricity subscription is
fixed at the commencement of each electricity subscription. The hash rate subscription plans are offered
under two modes. Under the classic mode, the
229 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
customer receives all of the mining rewards from the mining pool. Under the accelerator mode, the customer
pays a relatively lower computing power subscription fee. In exchange, we are entitled to additional
consideration once the customer’s cost is recovered. The additional consideration is determined as a
percentage of a customer’s mining profit derived from the subscribed computing power. We accept both
cryptocurrency and fiat currency as payments under the Cloud Hash Rate arrangements.
Cloud Hosting
Through Cloud Hosting, we provide our customers one-stop mining machines hosting solution that
integrates the provision of computing power generated from the specified second-hand mining machines and
the provision of maintenance service, which primarily includes electricity supply and daily maintenance and
repair care. We charge our customers an upfront amount at the commencement of the Cloud Hosting
arrangements so the customers can secure the procurement of the computing power from the specified
mining machines and the corresponding revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service, which
approximates to the life of the specified mining machines and is estimated to be two years, and maintenance
service fee, based on the consumption of resources, such as electricity, and the corresponding revenue is
recognized across each service cycle. The estimated life of these mining machines is reviewed at least at each
financial year-end and adjusted if the expectation of the realization of economic benefits from the specified
mining machines is different from the previous estimate. The Cloud Hosting arrangements are offered under
two modes. Under the classic mode, the customer receives all of the mining rewards from the mining pool.
Under the accelerator mode, the customer is charged with a lower upfront amount and enjoys a quicker
recovery of the costs. In exchange, we are entitled to additional consideration once a customer’s cost is
recovered. The additional consideration is determined as a percentage of a customer’s mining profit derived
from the computing power of the specified mining machines. No revenue was generated from the additional
consideration from Cloud Hosting arrangements offered under the accelerator mode for all the periods
presented. The additional transaction price is determined as a percentage of a customer’s mining profit
derived from the hash rate of the specified mining machines. We did not generate any revenue from the
additional consideration from Cloud Hosting arrangements offered under the “accelerated payback mode”
for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022. We
historically only accept cryptocurrency as payments for services under the Cloud Hosting arrangements.
Under the Cloud Hosting arrangements, our customers’ ability to direct the use of, and to obtain
substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the mining machines is limited while the mining machines are
in our possession. We have determined that we still retain control over the mining machines and
consequently, the mining machines under the Cloud Hosting arrangements were not derecognized from our
book.
General Hosting
We provide General Hosting services that enable our customers to run blockchain computing
operations. The service fee is charged to our customers monthly on a consumption basis, such as the
amount of electricity used in a period, based on the customer’s use of such resources. Revenue from the
General Hosting service is recognized across each service cycle. We accept both cryptocurrency and fiat
currency as payments for the provision of custody and maintenance service.
Sales of Mining Machines
We engage in the sales of mining machines on hand from time to time. We sell mining machines on hand
when, based on our judgement, selling machines of older models can (i) facilitate cash payback while
maintaining a reasonable profit range compared to utilizing them for our own operations and (ii) optimize the
efficiency of our mining fleets. Factors we considered include market conditions, capacity availability in our
mining datacenters and the availability of new-generation mining machines that are more efficient. We
recognize revenue from sales of mining machines to customers at the point in time when control of the
mining machines is transferred to our customers, which generally occurs upon shipment of the mining
machines as defined in the contract. We accept both cryptocurrency and fiat currency as payments for
mining machine purchase.
Others
We also generate immaterial revenue for all periods under discussion from other operations, which
mainly include the provision of management services and the sale of mining machine peripherals.
230 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Cost of Revenue
Our cost of revenue consists primarily of (i) electricity expenses incurred for operating our mining
machines in the revenue-generating activities, (ii) depreciation expense from the mining machines and the
mining datacenters hosting those mining machines, (iii) compensation expenses incurred by mining
datacenter personnel and (iv) cost of mining machines sold to customers.
Electricity Cost in Operating Mining Machines
We incur electricity costs when (i) operating proprietary mining machines for cryptocurrency mining, (ii)
generating hash rate for sales under Cloud Hash Rate, (iii) operating specified mining machines for
customers under Cloud Hosting and (iv) operating customer-owned mining machines during the provision of
General Hosting services.
Depreciation of Mining Machines and Mining Datacenters
Depreciation on our mining machines is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost up to
residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We estimate the useful life of mining machines
primarily based on the historical measures of (i) the period when each mining machine is able to deliver
expected performance and (ii) the frequency of technological advancement, which leads to new generation of
mining machines. We also estimate the residual value of the mining machines at the expected time of
disposal, taking into consideration factors such as make and model. The depreciation method, useful life and
residual value of the mining machines are reviewed at least at each financial year-end and adjusted, if
appropriate. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we estimated the useful lives of the mining
machines to be one year. The useful life for mining machines was changed from one year to one to two years
since the year ended December 31, 2021 for the mining machines of newer models that were purchased in
2021 as a result of the review conducted in July 2021.
Depreciation of mining datacenters is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful lives of the assets comprised thereof, such as buildings, machinery, electronic equipment and
leasehold improvement, and is recorded under depreciation of property, plant, and equipment. The
depreciation method, useful life and residual value of these asset are reviewed at least at each financial year-
end and adjusted if appropriate.
Compensation Expenses Incurred by Mining Datacenter Personnel
The compensation expenses incurred by mining datacenter personnel consists primarily of (i) share-
based payment expenses related to mining datacenter personnel as a result of the grant of options under the
2021 Share Incentive Plan and (ii) staff costs, including salaries, wages and other benefits in relation to
mining datacenter personnel.
Cost of Mining Machines Sold
The cost of mining machines sold is incurred when we sell our mining machines that have been used for
our business operations. It is recognized at the net book value of the associated mining machines.
Gross Profit/(Loss)
Our gross profit or loss is primarily affected by (i) Bitcoin prices, which have a significant and direct
effect on the amount of revenue we recognized from our operations, (ii) depreciation of mining machines,
which is directly related to the mining machine purchases we made, (iii) electricity costs, (iv) staff cost,
including salaries, wages and other benefits, (v) cost of mining machines sold and (vi) share-based payment
expenses.
Operating Expenses/(Income)

Comparison of Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 and 2022
Revenue
Our revenue decreased by 18.2% from US$219.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to
US$179.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Revenue generated from our proprietary mining business decreased by 63.2% from US$111.3 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to US$41.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The
change was mainly driven by (i) the price drop of Bitcoin, the most significant type of cryptocurrency
involved in our business operation and (ii) a decrease in the comparative number of Bitcoin mined
from proprietary mining, resulting from a decrease in the amount of hash rate allocated to our
proprietary mining business as a percentage of the total network hash rate. The average price of
Bitcoin for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $36,978.8 compared to $45,847.9 for the six months
ended June 30, 2021, representing a decrease of 19.3%, according to Frost & Sullivan. The network
hash rate, calculated on a six-month monthly average basis, increased by 48.4% from 140.5EH/s for
the six months ended June 30, 2021 to 208.5EH/s for the six months ended June 30, 2022, according to
Frost & Sullivan. The hash rate used for proprietary mining, calculated on a six-month monthly
average basis, was approximately 2.0EH/s for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was slightly
decreased compared to 2.2EH/s for the six months ended June 30, 2021 . We expect to remain flexible
in allocating hash rate between proprietary mining and hash rate sales through Cloud Hash Rate,
depending on the market condition.
Revenue generated from Cloud Hash Rate increased by 20.8% from US$62.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 to US$74.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was mainly
attributable to an increase in (i) revenue from hash rate subscription and (ii) revenue from electricity
subscription, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from additional consideration from acceleration
plan arrangements. Sales price of hash rate subscription is primarily priced with reference to Bitcoin
price and overall network hash rate at the time of sales and revenue generated from the subscription
is recognized evenly over the duration of the subscription. As a result, revenue from hash rate
subscription for the six months ended June 30, 2022 did not only consist of new sales during the six
months ended June 30, 2022 but also the amortized revenue from sales before 2022 and that captured
the Bitcoin price appreciation during 2021. According to Frost & Sullivan, the average Bitcoin price
for 2020, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 was US$11,057.0, US$47,385.2 and US$36,978.8,
respectively. The network hash rate for 2020 and 2021, calculated on a twelve-month monthly average
basis, and for the six months ended June 30, 2022, calculated on a six-month monthly average basis,
was 123.0EH/s, 140.2EH/s and 208.5EH/s, respectively, according to Frost & Sullivan. We have also
slightly increased hash rate allocated to Cloud Hash Rate, calculated on a six-month monthly average
basis, from 2.0EH/s for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to 2.2EH/s for the six months ended June
30, 2022. The increase in electricity subscription was as a result of a slight increase in electricity price
for existing customers of Cloud Hash Rate. The decrease in revenue from additional consideration
from Cloud Hash Rate arrangements offered under accelerator mode was due to the expiration of our
existing revenue sharing arrangements subscribed in the prior year and a delay in reaching the
condition for revenue sharing due to generally longer subscription periods and lower-than-expected
mining rewards.
Revenue generated from sales of mining machines decreased by 98.8% from US$37.8 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2021 to US$0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was
mainly attributable to a decrease in the number of mining machines we sold for the six months ended
June 30, 2022 as we had sold most of our mining machines of older models for the six months ended
June 30, 2021.
Revenue generated from Cloud Hosting increased by 13.0% from US$6.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 to US$6.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was mainly
attributable to a slight increase in electricity price for the existing customers of Cloud Hosting.
Revenue generated from General Hosting increased significantly from US$0.9 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2021 to US$53.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily
driven by an increase in the mining site capacity as a result of the expansion of our mining datacenter
operations in North America.
Cost of Revenue
Our cost of revenue increased by 43.9% from US$76.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to
US$110.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by an increase in (i) electricity cost
in operating mining machines, (ii) share-based payment expenses, (iii) salaries, wages and other benefits and

(iv) depreciation of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a decrease in (i) depreciation of mining
machines and (ii) cost of mining machines sold and accessories sold.
Depreciation of mining machines decreased by 55.9% from US$34.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2021 to US$15.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily because (i) a
significant number of the mining machines procured prior to 2021 as a result of our expanded hash
rate capacity are fully depreciated by the first half of 2021, and (ii) we changed the useful life for
mining machines from one year to two years for the mining machines of newer models that were
purchased starting from July 2021, which leads to lower depreciation afterwards.
Electricity cost in operating mining machines increased by 130.5% from US$25.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2021 to US$59.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was
attributed to the increased overall energy consumption related to the expansion of our mining
datacenter operations in North America.
Cost of mining machines sold and accessories sold decreased by 87.5% from US$4.6 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2021 to US$0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven
by the decrease in the number of mining machines we sold for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as
we had sold most of our mining machines of older models for the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Share-based payment expenses attributed to cost of revenue increased from nil for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 to US$5.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was due to the
grant of options to attract and retain quality employees for the Group under the 2021 Share Incentive
Plan approved in July 2021.
Salaries, wages and other benefits attributed to cost of revenue increased by 136.4% from US$2.7
million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to US$6.5 million for the six months ended June
30,2022, which was due to the increase in salaries, wages and other benefits to attract and retain
quality employees as a result of the expansion of our mining datacenter operations in North America.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment attributed to cost of revenue increased by 78.7% from
US$6.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to US$11.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2022, primarily as a result of the expansion of our mining facilities.
Selling Expenses
Our selling expenses increased significantly from US$0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021
to US$6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to (i) the US$4.5 million increase in
share based payment expenses as a result of the grant of options to sales personnel under the 2021 Share
Incentive Plan approved in July 2021, and (ii) the US$0.6 million increase in staff costs, including salaries,
wages and benefits to sales personnel.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses increased by 374.1% from US$11.1 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 to US$52.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to (i) the
US$29.3 million increase in share-based payment expenses as a result of the grant of option to administrative
personnel under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan approved in July 2021, and (ii) the US$7.1 million increase in
staff costs, including salaries, wages and benefits to general and administrative personnel.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses increased by 484.1% from US$3.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 to US$19.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to (i) the
US$14.9 million increase in share-based payment expenses as a result of the grant of option to research and
development personnel under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan approved in July 2021, and (ii) the US$1.5 million
increase in staff costs, including salaries, wages and benefits to research and development personnel.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Other Operating Income /(Expenses)
We generated other operating income of US$14.3 million and incurred other operating expenses of
US$2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. This change was primarily
because we recorded US$16.4 million gain on disposal of cryptocurrencies for the six months ended June 30,
2021, compared to US$2.2 million loss on disposal of cryptocurrencies for the six months ended June 30,
2022, which is associated with Bitcoin price drop prior to such disposal given we typically sell Bitcoins
earned from our principal business lines within the next few days.
Other Net Gain/(Loss)
We recorded other net gain of US$1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which primarily
included (i) net gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment of US$0.6 million and (ii) others of US$0.6
million, which mainly included return of wealth management product and other minor gains from operation.
We recorded other net loss of US$1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, which primarily included
a one-off impairment loss of approximately US$2.0 million resulting from a pre-mature investment.
Profit/(Loss) from Operations
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a loss from operations of US$11.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 and a profit from operations of US$140.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Income Tax Benefit/(Expenses)
We recorded income tax expenses of US$26.6 million and US$8.0 million for the six months ended June
30, 2021 and 2022.
Net Profit/(Loss)
As a result of the foregoing, we incurred a net loss of US$25.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2022 and a net profit of US$113.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2021
Revenue
Our revenue increased by 111.7% from US$186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to
US$394.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Revenue generated from our proprietary mining business increased by 116.6% from US$88.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020 to US$191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The
change was mainly driven by price appreciation of Bitcoin, the most significant type of
cryptocurrency involved in our business operation, partially offset by a decrease in the number of
Bitcoin mined, primarily resulting from the Bitcoin halving event on May 11, 2020 and a slight
decrease in the hash rate allocated to proprietary mining. The average price of Bitcoin for the year
ended December 31, 2021 was US$47,385 compared to US$11,057 for the year ended December 31,
2020, representing an increase of 328.5%, according to Frost & Sullivan. The hash rate used for
proprietary mining, calculated on a twelve-month monthly average basis, was approximately 2.2EH/s
for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was slightly decreased compared to 2.3EH/s for the year
ended December 31, 2020.
Revenue generated from Cloud Hash Rate increased by 58.7% from US$78.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 to US$124.2 million for year ended December 31, 2021, which was mainly
attributable to the increase in (i) revenue from additional consideration from acceleration plan
arrangements and (ii) revenue from hash rate subscription, partially offset by a decrease in electricity
charges as a result of lower hash rate allocated to Cloud Hash Rate in 2021. The increase in revenue
generated from additional consideration from acceleration plan arrangements was due to the launch of
subscription plans under “accelerator mode” in 2020, an increase in the number of customers who
237

TABLE OF CONTENTS
recovered their investment costs in 2021 as well as Bitcoin price appreciation. The increase in revenue
from hash rate subscription was mainly driven by the higher sales price of hash rate subscription and
the higher demand for Cloud Hash Rate, both of which were primarily attributable to (i) Bitcoin price
appreciation, and (ii) our increased brand recognition as a result of our expanding scale of operations
as well as diverse hash rate subscription plans and high-quality hash rate. The hash rate allocated to
Cloud Hash Rate, calculated on a twelve-month monthly average basis, was approximately 2.0EH/s
for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was slightly decreased compared to 2.1EH/s for the year
ended December 31, 2020.
Revenue generated from sales of mining machines increased by 188.4% from US$15.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 to US$45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was
mainly attributable to the higher sales price of mining machines driven by Bitcoin price appreciation,
offset by the decrease in the number of mining machines we sold in 2021.
Revenue generated from Cloud Hosting increased by 158.4% from US$2.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to US$7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was mainly
attributable to an increase in the customer base of Cloud Hosting following the launch of Cloud
Hosting service in 2020.
Revenue generated from General Hosting increased from nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 to
US$18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by (i) professional miners’
higher demand for hosting services in 2021, (ii) the increase in mining site capacity as a result of the
expansion of our mining datacenter operations and (iii) our efforts to attract more hosting customers
to diversify our revenue stream.
Cost of Revenue
Our cost of revenue decreased by 26.9% from US$209.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to
US$153.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by decrease in (i) depreciation of
mining machines, (ii) the electricity cost in operating mining machines and (iii) cost of mining machine sold,
partially offset by an increase in share-based payment expenses attributed to cost of revenue, increase in
salaries, wages, and other benefits attributed to cost of revenue and increase in depreciation of property,
plant and equipment attributed to cost of revenue.
Depreciation of mining machines decreased by 55.3% from US$98.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to US$43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily because (i) the
mining machines procured at the beginning of 2020 as a result of our expanded hash rate capacity
contributed large depreciation amount for the year ended December 31, 2020, and are fully depreciated
by the first half of 2021 as those mining machines were depreciated in one year on a straight-line
basis, and (ii) we changed the useful life for mining machines from one year to one to two years for
the mining machines of newer models that were purchased in 2021 starting from July 2021, which
leads to lower depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Electricity cost in operating mining machines decreased by 18.9% from US$72.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 to US$58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by
the lowered overall energy consumption of 39.2 j/T as of December 31, 2021, compared to 48 j/T as of
December 31, 2020 for our mining machines, partially offset by the increase in managing hash rate
calculated on a twelve-month average basis from approximately 4.6EH/s for the year ended December
31, 2020 to approximately 5.7EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Cost of mining machines sold decreased by 65.9% from US$17.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to US$6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by (i) the lower
carrying book value of the mining machines sold in 2021 as the mining machines sold in 2021 were
used for a longer period with most of their costs depreciated compared to the ones sold in 2020 and
(ii) decrease in the number of mining machines sold in 2021.
Share-based payment expenses attributed to cost of revenue increased from nil for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to US$10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was due to the
grant of options under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan to mining datacenter personnel in the second
half of 2021.

Salaries, wages and other benefits attributed to cost of revenue increased by 99.4% from US$4.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to US$9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021,
which was due to the increase in salaries, wages and other benefits to mining datacenter personnel as
a result of the expansion of our mining datacenter operations.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment attributed to cost of revenue increased by 47.0% from
US$9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to US$14.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2021, primarily attributable to our expansion of the mining datacenter.
Selling Expenses
Our selling expenses increased by 51.8% from US$5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to
US$8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the US$5.2 million increase in share-
based payment expenses attributed to selling expense as a result of the grant of options to sales personnel
under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan in the second half of 2021, partially offset by US$1.4 million decrease in
staff costs, including salaries, wages and benefits to sales personnel and the US$1.3 million decrease in
advertising expenses, as we conducted fewer marketing activities. As a result of price appreciation of
Bitcoin, the most significant cryptocurrency involved in our business operation, and wider market
recognition of our brand name, we are able to achieve satisfying sales performance without engaging in
proactive marketing activities.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses increased by 342.7% from US$20.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to US$89.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to (i) US$54.5
million increase in share-based payment expenses attributed to general and administrative expenses as a
result of the grant of option to administrative personnel under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan in the second
half of 2021, (ii) US$7.5 million increase in consulting service fees attributed to general and administrative
expenses charged by professional parties due to our efforts in capital market activities.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses increased by 201.3% from US$9.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to US$29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to (i)
US$18.2 million increase in share-based payment expenses attributed to research and development expenses
of as a result of the grant of options to research and development personnel under the 2021 Share Incentive
Plan in the second half of 2021 and (ii) US$1.3 million increase in research and development technical service
fees.
Other Operating Income /(Expenses)
We incurred other operating expenses of US$2.0 million and generated other operating income of
US$14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. This change was primarily
attributable to (i) US$16.0 million increase in net gain on disposal of cryptocurrencies for the year ended
December 31, 2021, which is associated with Bitcoin price change prior to such disposal given we typically
sell Bitcoins earned from our principal business lines within the next few days, (ii) US$3.7 million losses from
change in fair value of cryptocurrencies lent, (iii) US$2.9 million decrease in net loss on disposal of mining
machine at scrap value, as a result of fewer mining machines disposals in 2021 because the new mining
machines we purchased in 2021 were of more recent models and in a more stable condition and (iv) US$2.0
million write-off of receivables from related parties for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to nil for
the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other Net Gain/(Loss)
We recorded other net gain of US$2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to other
net loss of US$2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to (i) the net
gain on settlement of balances between Bitmain of US$4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) an impairment of property, plant and

equipment of US$2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to nil for the year ended
December 31, 2021, partially offset by the impairment loss of a pre-matured investment of US$2.0 million
associated with a forfeited investment project of US$2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, while
we did not conduct similar transaction or incur such cost for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Profit/(Loss) from Operations
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a loss from operations of US$63.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and a profit from operations of US$130.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Income Tax Benefit/(Expenses)
We recorded an income tax benefit of US$8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and an
income tax expenses of US$48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily because we achieved
profit before taxation of US$130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to loss before
taxation of US$63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Profit/(Loss)
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of US$55.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 and a net profit of US$82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2020
Revenue
Our revenue increased by 110.0% from US$88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to
US$186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by revenue growth in two of our
three major business lines as follows.
Revenue generated from proprietary mining increased by 136.2% from US$37.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to US$88.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was mainly
attributable to increase in our proprietary hash rate and the price appreciation of Bitcoin, the most
significant type of cryptocurrency involved in our business operation, partially offset by decrease in
the number of Bitcoins mined, primarily resulting from the Bitcoin halving event on May 11, 2020. The
hash rate allocated to proprietary mining, calculated on a twelve-month average basis, increased from
approximately 0.5EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately 2.3EH/s for the year
ended December 31, 2020. The average price of Bitcoin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was
US$11,057.0 compared to US$7,358.3 for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase
of 50.3%, according to Frost & Sullivan.
Revenue generated from Cloud Hash Rate increased by 80.0% from US$43.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to US$78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was
primarily driven by increase in our hash rate capacity, Bitcoin price appreciation and expansion of our
customer base. The hash rate allocated to Cloud Hash Rate, calculated on a twelve-month average
basis, increased from approximately 0.8EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately
2.1EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth in customer base was primarily driven by
our increased brand recognition as a result of our expanding scale of operations as well as diverse
hash rate subscription plans and high quality hash rate.
Cost of Revenue
Our cost of revenue increased by 112.0% from US$98.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to
US$209.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increase in (i) the depreciation of
mining machines, (ii) electricity cost in operating mining machines and (iii) cost of mining machines sold for
the year ended December 31, 2020.
Depreciation of mining machines increased by 147.6% from US$39.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 to US$98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Electricity cost in operating
240 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
mining machines increased by 91.2% from US$37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$72.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of mining machines sold increased by 225.2% from US$5.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
increases in both depreciation of mining machines and electricity cost in operating mining machines are
primarily attributable to the expansion of our hash rate capacity, calculated on a twelve-month average basis,
from 51MW on average in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 136MW on average in the year ended
December 31, 2020. The increase in cost of mining machines sold was primarily attributable to the increased
sales of mining machines.
Selling Expenses
Our selling expenses increased by 77.5% from US$3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to
US$5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to (i) the one-off payroll expense to sales
personnel as a result of our separation from Bitmain in 2020 and (ii) the increase in promotional expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses increased by 168.5% from US$7.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to US$20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to one-off payroll
expense to administrative personnel as a result of our separation from Bitmain.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses increased by 106.3% from US$4.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to US$9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to one-off payroll
expense as a result of our separation from Bitmain.
Other Operating Expenses
Our other operating expenses decreased by 66.1% from US$6.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to US$2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in net gain
on disposal of cryptocurrencies, which is associated with change of price of Bitcoin, the most significant
type of cryptocurrency involved in our business operation, prior to such disposal given we typically sell
Bitcoins earned from proprietary mining within the next few days.
Other Net Gain/(Loss)
We recorded other net gain of US$0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and other net loss of
US$2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to an increase in
impairment of property, plant and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2020 as we decided to
discontinue our construction of a mining datacenter in Washington, United States.
Loss from Operations
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded loss from operations of US$31.3 million and US$63.4 million for
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Income Tax Benefit
Our income tax benefit increased from US$2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$8.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily because our loss before taxation increased from
US$30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$63.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2020.
Net Loss
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of US$27.9 million and US$55.8 million for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our separation from Bitmain, we have financed our operations primarily with cash flow from
disposal of cryptocurrencies earned from principal business operations. Our net cash and cash equivalents
decreased from US$59.8 million as of December 31, 2019 to US$44.8 million as of December 31, 2020, primarily
as a result of our active hash rate expansion in 2020. Our net cash and cash equivalents increased to
US$372.1 million as of December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to the increase in adjusted EBITDA, which is
a non-IFRS financial measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
further adjusted to exclude share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2. A reconciliation of profit/(loss), the
most comparable IFRS measure, to adjusted EBITDA is set forth in “- Non-IFRS Financial Measure” above.
Our net cash and cash equivalents decreased to US$330.8 million as of June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to
our active construction of mining datacenters in North America.
To date, we have not seen a material impact on our liquidity from events related to the COVID-19
pandemic. We believe that our cash, short-term investment and anticipated proceeds from disposal of
cryptocurrencies in connection with our principal business will be sufficient to meet our current and
anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 18 months from the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Our material cash requirements as of June 30, 2022 and any subsequent interim period primarily include
our purchase of plant, property and equipment, lease obligations, and borrowings. Other than those as
discussed below, we did not have any significant capital and other commitments, long-term obligations or
guarantees as of June 30, 2022.
Purchase of property, plant and equipment. Purchase of property, plant and equipment primarily
consist of the purchase of machinery, equipments and other expenditure associated with mining datacenter
construction and operations. The total cash outflow for the purchase of property, plant and equipment were
US$11.5 million, US$19.8 million, US$62.4 million and US$49.7 million for the years ended 2019, 2020 and 2021
and the six months ended June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, we had commitments that are scheduled to be
paid within 12 months for the construction of mining datacenters of approximately US$18.4 million.
Lease obligations.  We occupy most of our office premises and certain mining datacenter under lease
arrangements, which generally have an initial lease term between one and a half to seven years. Lease
contracts are typically made for fixed periods but may have extension options. Any extension options in
these leases have not been included in the lease liabilities unless we are reasonably certain to exercise the
extension option. Periods after termination options are only included in the lease term if the lease is
reasonably certain not to be terminated. The total cash outflow for leases, including the capital element of
lease rentals paid and interests paid on leases for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the
six months ended June 30, 2022 was approximately US$3.9 million, US$5.4 million, US$5.4 million and US$2.8
million, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, lease liabilities mature based on contractual undiscounted
payments within 12 months and over 12 months were US$5.8 million and US$72.8 million, respectively.
Borrowings.  Our borrowings as of June 30, 2022 represented a commitment of US$29.6 million relating
to the principal amount and interests in connection with the issuance of the Bitdeer Convertible Note, a
US$30 million convertible note, on July 23, 2021, bearing an annual interest rate of 8%, which will mature on
July 23, 2023.
We intend to fund our existing and future material cash requirements primarily with our cash, short-term
investment and anticipated proceeds from disposal of cryptocurrencies in connection with our principal
business, which is classified as an investing activity. However, our future capital requirements will depend
on many factors, including market acceptance of cryptocurrency, our growth, our ability to scale up our
infrastructure and hash rate, our ability to effectively control costs, our ability to attract and retain
customers, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, expansion of sales and marketing activities
and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are
insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional
equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders.
The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing
such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. In the
event that additional
242 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
financing is required from outside sources, there is a possibility we may not be able to raise it on term
acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment
obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our
shares and classified as shareholder’s equity or that are not reflected in our financial statements.
Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated
entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable
interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or
engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us.
Other than as discussed above, we did not have any significant capital and other commitments, long-
term obligations or guarantees as of June 30, 2022.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Financial Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of
loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our
financial risk exposure is primarily the result of cryptocurrency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk, credit
risk and liquidity risk.
Cryptocurrency Risk
We are exposed to cryptocurrency risk as we yield cryptocurrencies from certain revenue arrangements.
We recognize revenue based on the spot fair value of cryptocurrencies on the day they are earned, but the
value of the cryptocurrencies is subject to change on the date they are disposed for fiat currency.
Cryptocurrency prices are affected by various forces including global supply and demand, interest
rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation and the global political and economic conditions. Our profitability
is highly correlated to the current and future market price of cryptocurrencies and a decline in the market
prices for cryptocurrencies could negatively impact our future operations. In addition, we may not be able to
liquidate our holdings of cryptocurrencies at our desired price if required, or, in extreme market conditions,
we may not be able to liquidate our holdings of cryptocurrencies at all.
Cryptocurrencies have a limited history and the fair value historically has been very volatile. Historical
performance of cryptocurrencies is not indicative of their future price performance. Our cryptocurrencies
currently primarily consist of Bitcoin. We currently do not use any derivative contracts to hedge its exposure
to cryptocurrency risk, but management closely monitors the impact of the mainstream cryptocurrency
exchange market on the change of exchange rates from cryptocurrency to fiat currency. We limit our exposure
to the cryptocurrency risk by including in its operation strategy to dispose the cryptocurrencies for fiat
currency shortly after they are earned.
Fluctuations in the market price of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies may have a more linear and
quantifiable impact on some of our businesses than others. A 10% increase or decrease in the average market
price of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies over 2019, 2020, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022,
245 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
without considering other factors, would have had the following impact on our revenue: (i) an increase or
decrease in our revenue from proprietary mining by 10%; (ii) an increase or decrease in our revenue from
Cloud Hash Rate in general, as the price of Bitcoin is a key factor in determining the hash rate subscription
fee, provided however, the precise impact is subject to other factors, such as the expected mining rewards at
the time of subscription, contract terms, allocation of hash rate between classic and accelerator mode, and
electricity price; and (iii) an increase or decrease in revenue from Cloud Hosting, provided that the overall
impact is less linear as compared to in the case of proprietary mining. The impact on the revenue from sales
of mining machines depends on market sentiments towards Bitcoin at the relevant point in time, in addition
to the actual price of Bitcoin. A change in the market price of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies would
not have had a material effect on our revenue from other sources.
In addition, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies accounted for 0.3%, 1.1%, 1.0% and 0.5% of our total
assets as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021, and June 30, 2022, respectively. Since
we dispose cryptocurrencies in a relatively short period of time, a 10% increase or decrease in the market
price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021
and June 30, 2022, respectively, would not have had a material effect on our total assets at these dates.
Interest Rate Risk
Our interest rate risk is primarily attributable to bank deposits, restricted cash and borrowings. Bank
deposits, restricted cash and borrowings at variable rates and at fixed rates expose us to cash flow interest
rate risk and fair value interest rate risk respectively. Management closely monitors the fluctuation of such
rates periodically. If the interest rates had been higher or lower by 1% with all other variables including tax
rate being held constant, the profit/(loss) before tax would have been higher or lower by US$0.6 million,
US$0.5 million, US$3.5 million and US$3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and the
six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.
Investment Risk
We are exposed to investment risk from investment transactions such as the purchase of
cryptocurrency- denoted wealth management products. These investments are not principal-guaranteed, and
we may suffer material loss from such investments. We monitor our investments closely and limit our
exposure to the investment risk by including in our operation strategy the requirements to invest only in
robust wealth management products and the investments need to be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter.
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to foreign currency risk as we conduct transactions which give rise to payables and
cash balances that are denominated in foreign currencies and the fair value or future cash flows of our
financial instrument may fluctuate due to movement in foreign exchange rates of these foreign currencies.
The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we are not able to accurately forecast. Our
management is closely monitoring our exposure to currency risk and seeks to minimize its exposure to such
risk. We were not exposed to material foreign currency risk during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020
and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022.
Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a
financial loss to us. Credit risk arises mainly from cash deposited in the banks and cryptocurrencies
deposited in custody, cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management
product purchases.
To manage risk arising from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, we only transact with reputable
financial institutions, which have no recent history of default. As such, we are not subject to material credit
risk arising from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
Substantially all of our cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets held in the custody by Matrix Finance and
Technologies Holding Company (“Matrixport Group”), a related party. To limit exposure to credit risk
246 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
relating to cryptocurrencies under custody, we evaluate the system security design of the custody service
provider and regularly reviews the exposure of cryptocurrencies held in custody. We have further
implemented internal controls to ensure the appropriate access to the cryptocurrencies under custody and
adopted the operating strategy of disposing of the cryptocurrency for fiat currency shortly after they are
earned. We expect that there is no significant credit risk from non-performance by Matrixport Group.
However, Bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been, and may in the future be,
subject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities. A security breach or cyberattack
could result in a partial or total loss of our cryptocurrencies and such a loss could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We also have credit exposure to cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-denoted
wealth management product purchases. We assess such credit risk both at contract inception and each
quarter or in shorter interval by considering the past collection experience and any indications that the
corresponding amount may not be fully collected. To manage such exposure, we continuously monitor the
relevant factors, such as the liquidity of the underlying cryptocurrencies, negative report related to the
counterparty, and only transact with creditworthy counterparties and include in our operation strategy that
the lending needs to be collected, and the wealth management products need to be redeemed within the same
fiscal quarter. Currently, we only conduct such transactions with the Matrixport Group. We had never
experienced credit losses and have no existing exposures to such credit risk as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Consequently, credit exposure to these transactions is not considered material.
Liquidity Risk
Our liquidity risk is minimal. We currently have sufficient reserve of cash. We recorded US$330.7 million
cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022, and our net cash used in operating activities during the six
months ended June 30, 2022 were US$151.8 million. We believe that our cash, short-term investment and
anticipated proceeds from disposal of cryptocurrencies in connection with our principal business will be
sufficient to meet our current and anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at
least the next 18 months from the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. We manage our liquidity risk by
monitoring cash flow generated from operations, available borrowing capacity, and by managing the maturity
profiles of our long-term loans. We expect to continue our low-leverage strategy and plan to lower our
liquidity risk by expanding our capital expenditure-light businesses such as Hash Rate Marketplace.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We adopted the following recently issued or amended standards in the period between January 1, 2022

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
We prepare our combined and consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2020 and 2021 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). We prepare our interim financial information for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34 ‘Interim
Financial Reporting’ issued by the IASB.
In preparing the financial statements and the interim financial information, our management has made
judgments and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, profit and loss. Estimates and judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. We make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The
resulting accounting estimates may not be equal to the related actual results.
We believe the accounting policies related to the depreciation of mining machines, cryptocurrency
accounting, revenue from the proprietary mining business, income taxes and share-based payments for the
years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 involve significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and interim financial
information. Our use of judgements and estimates is disclosed in the Note 3 and the related accounting
policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this proxy statement/​prospectus. When reviewing our financial statements and interim financial information,
you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, our significant judgments and other
uncertainties affecting our applications of those policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes of
such policies, judgments and uncertainties. You should read the descriptions of these significant judgments
and estimates in conjunction with other disclosures included in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of
reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS
Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. The JOBS Act
also exempts us from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting
under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).
Holding Company Structure
Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company is a limited liability company incorporated in the Cayman
Islands on November 18, 2020 with no material operations of its own. We currently conduct our operations
primarily through our subsidiaries. As a result, Bitdeer’s ability to pay dividends primarily depends upon
dividends paid by our subsidiaries. If our existing subsidiaries or any newly formed ones incur debt on their
own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to
us.

interest by August 31, 2022 pursuant to the amended Promissory Note issued on May 30, 2022. On August
31, 2022, BSGA issued an extension notice the Sponsor, to extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note

US$50.0 million to Matrixport Group and received approximately US$0.4 million interest income. Bitdeer also
purchased wealth management products in a total amount of approximately US$150.0 million from Matrixport
Group and received approximately US$0.3 million in return. Both the loans and the wealth management
products were fully collected and redeemed as of June 30, 2022.
As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we do not have any outstanding cryptocurrency
lending to Matrixport Group or any outstanding wealth management product purchased from Matrixport
Group or otherwise. All lending or wealth management products previously purchased from Matrixport Group
had been fully collected or redeemed by the end of December 2022.
Related Person Transaction Policy
Related Person Transaction Policy of Bitdeer
Bitdeer has adopted a related person transaction policy that sets forth the policies procedures for the
identification, review, and approval or ratification of related person transactions. Related person transaction
is any transaction involving any “related person”, as defined in the policy, and the Company or its
subsidiaries. The policy sets forth policies and procedures designed to minimize potential conflicts of
interest arising from any dealings it may have with its affiliates and provides appropriate procedures for the
disclosure of any real or potential conflicts of interest that may exist from time to time. Specifically, the audit
committee is responsible for keeping and updating a list of related persons and the principals of different
departments are responsible for identifying and monitoring related party transactions. The policy details the
authority of the board of directors and shareholders to review and approve different related party
transactions. For any related person transaction with a transactional value no less than US$5 million and
accounting for more than 1% of the total audited assets or market value of the most recent audited period,
the same committee shall review and submit a written report to the board of directors for review and the
transaction shall be approved in shareholding meetings. Directors are required to disclose interests in the
related party transaction and only disinterested directors can vote for a related person transaction in a board
meeting. The price terms of all related party transactions shall be fair, taking into account prices in the
comparable independent third-party market, price terms of non-related party transactions, and relevant cost
and revenue. In addition, no loan shall be made to the Company’s directors, officers or supervisors directly
or indirectly.
Related Person Transaction Policy of BSGA
BSGA has adopted a code of ethics requiring it to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests,
except under guidelines or resolutions approved by BSGA Board (or the appropriate committee of BSGA
Board) or as disclosed in its public filings with the SEC. Under its code of ethics, conflict of interest
situations includes any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or
guarantee of indebtedness) involving the company.
In addition, BSGA audit committee, pursuant to a written charter that it adopted, is responsible for
reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that it enters into such transactions. An
affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at which a quorum
is present is required in order to approve a related party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire
audit committee constitutes a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of the
members of the audit committee is required to approve a related party transaction. BSGA also requires each
director and executive officer to complete a directors’ and officers’ questionnaire that elicits information
about related party transactions.
These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the
independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
To further minimize conflicts of interest, BSGA has agreed not to consummate an initial business
combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of BSGA’s Sponsor, officers or directors unless BSGA,
or a committee of independent directors, has obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company BSGA is
seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm, that the initial business combination is fair to BSGA
from a financial point of view. Furthermore, no finder’s fees, reimbursements or cash payments will be made
to BSGA Sponsor, officers or directors, or BSGA’s or their affiliates, for services rendered to BSGA prior to or
in connection with the completion of BSGA’s initial business combination. However, the following payments
will be made to BSGA’s Sponsor, officers or directors, or BSGA’s or their affiliates:
Repayment of up to an aggregate of up to US$200,000 in loans made to BSGA by its Sponsor to cover
offering-related and organizational expenses;
Payment to an affiliate of BSGA’s Sponsor of US$10,000 per month, for up to 12 months (or up to 18
months from the closing of this offering if BSGA extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination by the full amount of time), for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
support;
Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing
an initial business combination; and
Repayment of loans which may be made by BSGA’s Sponsor or an affiliate of BSGA’s Sponsor or
certain of BSGA’s officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended
initial business combination, the terms of which have not been determined nor have any written
agreements been executed with respect thereto. Up to US$1,150,000 of such loans may be convertible
into units, at a price of US$10.00 per unit at the option of the lender.
BSGA’s audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to BSGA Sponsor,
officers or directors, or BSGA’s or their affiliates.
Related Person Transaction Policy of BTG upon Consummation of the Business Combination
Effective upon the consummation of the Business Combination, BTG expects to adopt a related person
transaction policy that sets forth its procedures for the identification, review, consideration and approval or
ratification of related person transactions. The policy will become effective upon the consummation of the
Business Combination. For purposes of BTG’s policy only, a related person transaction is a transaction,
arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which
BTG and any related person are, were or will be participants in which the amount involved exceeds the lesser
of US$120,000 or one percent of the average of the company’s total assets at year end for the last two
completed fiscal years. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to BTG as an employee
or director are not covered by this policy. A related person is any executive officer, director or beneficial
owner of more than 5% of any class of BTG’s voting securities and any of their respective immediate family
members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons.
Under the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related person transaction, including any
transaction that was not a related person transaction when originally consummated or any transaction that
was not initially identified as a related person transaction prior to consummation, BTG’s management must
present information regarding the related person transaction to BTG’s audit committee, or, if audit committee
approval would be inappropriate, to another independent body of BTG’s Board of Directors, for review,
consideration and approval or ratification. The presentation must include a description of, among other
things, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related persons, the benefits to BTG of the
transaction and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as
the case may be, an unrelated third party or to or from employees generally. Under the policy, BTG will
collect information that BTG deems reasonably necessary from each director, executive officer and, to the
extent feasible, significant shareholder to enable BTG to identify any existing or potential related-person
transactions and to effectuate the terms of the policy. In addition, under BTG’s Code of Conduct that BTG
expects to adopt prior to the closing of this Business Combination, BTG’s employees and directors will have
an affirmative responsibility to disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to
give rise to a conflict of interest. In considering related person transactions, BTG’s audit committee, or other
256

TABLE OF CONTENTS
independent body of BTG’s Board of Directors, will take into account the relevant available facts and
circumstances including, but not limited to:
the risks, costs and benefits to BTG;
the impact on a director’s independence in the event that the related person is a director, immediate
family member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated;
the availability of other sources for comparable services or products; and
the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from employees
generally.
The policy requires that, in determining whether to approve, ratify or reject a related person transaction,
BTG’s audit committee, or other independent body of BTG’s Board of Directors, must consider, in light of
known circumstances, whether the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, BTG’s best interests and
those of BTG’s shareholders, as BTG’s audit committee, or other independent body of BTG’s Board of
Directors, determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.

A summary of the material provisions governing BTG’s share capital immediately following
consummation of the Business Combination is described below. This summary is not complete and should be
read together with the Amended BTG Articles, a copy of which is appended to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex B.
BTG is a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability and immediately following
consummation of the Business Combination its affairs will be governed by the Amended BTG Articles, the
Cayman Islands Companies Act, and the common law of the Cayman Islands.
BTG’s authorized share capital consists of 500,000,000,000 shares of a par value of US$0.0000001 each,
consisting of 499,600,000,000 BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, 200,000,000 BTG Class V Ordinary Shares and
200,000,000 undesignated shares. All BTG Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding at the consummation of
the Business Combination will be fully paid and non-assessable.
The Amended BTG Articles will become effective upon consummation of the Business Combination.
The following are summaries of material provisions of the Amended BTG Articles and the Cayman Islands
Companies Act insofar as they relate to the material terms of the BTG Ordinary Shares.
Ordinary Shares
General. Holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares and BTG Class V Ordinary Shares will generally have
the same rights except for voting and conversion rights. BTG will maintain a register of its shareholders.
Every shareholder whose name is entered in such register may, without payment and upon written request,
request a share certificate within two calendar months after allotment or lodgement of transfer.
Immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, Mr. Jihan Wu will control the
voting power of all of the outstanding BTG Class V Ordinary Shares. Upon any transfer of BTG Class V
Ordinary Shares by a holder thereof to any person which is not a Founder Entity, those shares will
automatically convert into BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.
Dividends. The holders of BTG Ordinary Shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by
BTG board of directors. In addition, BTG shareholders may declare dividends by ordinary resolution, but no
dividend may exceed the amount recommended by BTG directors. Amended BTG Articles provide that the
directors may, before recommending or declaring any dividend, set aside out of the funds legally available
for distribution such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, in the absolute
discretion of the directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies or for equalizing dividends or for any
other purpose to which those funds may be properly applied. Under the laws of the Cayman Islands, BTG
may pay a dividend out of either profit or the credit standing in BTG’s share premium account, provided that
in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in BTG being unable to pay its debts as they
fall due in the ordinary course of business immediately following the date on which the distribution or
dividend is paid.
Voting Rights. Holders of BTG Ordinary Shares have the right to receive notice of, attend, speak and
vote at general meetings of BTG. Holders of BTG Ordinary Shares shall, at all times, vote together as one
class on all matters submitted to a vote by the members at any such general meeting, provided that Class A
Ordinary Shares and Class V Ordinary Shares shall each vote as a separate class on any proposed variation
of rights affecting Class A Ordinary Shares only or Class V Ordinary Shares only (as the case may be). On all
matters subject to a vote at general meetings of BTG, (1) on a show of hands and/or (2) on a poll, each BTG
shareholder shall be entitled to one vote for each BTG Class A Ordinary Share and ten (10) votes for each
BTG Class V Ordinary Share of which such shareholder is the holder. Voting at any shareholders’ meeting is
by show of hands unless a poll is demanded (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of
hands). A poll may be demanded by the chairman of such meeting or any BTG shareholder holding not less
than 10% of the votes attaching to the total ordinary shares which are present in person or by proxy at the
meeting.
An ordinary resolution to be passed at a meeting by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a
simple majority of the votes of the ordinary shares which are cast by those BTG shareholders who are
entitled to do so attend and vote at the meeting, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of no
less than two-thirds of the votes of ordinary shares which cast by those BTG shareholders who are entitled
to do so

TABLE OF CONTENTS
attend and vote at the meeting. Under the Companies Act, a special resolution will be required in order for
BTG to effect certain important matters as stipulated in the Companies Act, such as a change of name or
making changes to Amended BTG Articles. Holders of the BTG Ordinary Shares may, among other things,
divide or combine their shares by ordinary resolution.
General Meetings of Shareholders. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, BTG is not obliged by the
Companies Act to call shareholders’ annual general meetings. Amended BTG Articles provide that BTG may
(but are not obliged to) in each year hold a general meeting as BTG’s annual general meeting in which case
BTG shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it, and the annual general meeting shall be held
at such time and place as may be determined by BTG directors.
Shareholders’ general meetings may be convened by the chairman of the BTG board of directors or by a
majority of BTG board of directors. Advance notice of at least ten (10) calendar days is required for the
convening of BTG’s annual general shareholders’ meeting (if any) and any other general meeting of BTG
shareholders. A quorum required for any general meeting of shareholders consists of at least one
shareholder present or by proxy, who alone or together hold not less than 50% of all votes attaching to all of
BTG Shares in issue and entitled to vote.
The Companies Act provides BTG shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting,
and does not provide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However,
these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Amended BTG Articles provide that
upon the requisition of any one or more of BTG shareholders who together hold shares which carry in
aggregate not less than one-third of the total number of votes attaching to all issued and outstanding shares
of BTG entitled to vote at general meetings, BTG board will be required to convene an Extraordinary General
Meeting and put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting. However, Amended BTG Articles
do not provide BTG shareholders with any right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or
Extraordinary General Meetings not called by such shareholders.
Transfer of Ordinary Shares. Subject to the restrictions set out below, any of BTG shareholders may
transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or
any other form approved by BTG board of directors.
BTG board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary
share which is not fully paid up or on which we have a lien. BTG board of directors may also decline to
register any transfer of any ordinary share unless:
the instrument of transfer is lodged with BTG, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares
to which it relates and such other evidence as BTG board of directors may reasonably require to show
the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of ordinary shares;
the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required;
in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the ordinary share is to
be transferred does not exceed four; and
a fee of such maximum sum as The Nasdaq Global Market may determine to be payable or such lesser
sum as BTG directors may from time to time require is paid to BTG in respect thereof.
If BTG directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within three calendar months after the date on
which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such
refusal.
The registration of transfers may, after compliance with any notice required of The Nasdaq Global
Market, be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as BTG board of directors
may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended
nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.
Liquidation. On the winding up of BTG, if the assets available for distribution amongst BTG
shareholders shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the share capital at the commencement of
the
259 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
winding up, the surplus shall be distributed amongst BTG shareholders in proportion to the par value of the
shares held by them at the commencement of the winding up, subject to a deduction from those shares in
respect of which there are monies due, of all monies payable to BTG for unpaid calls or otherwise. If BTG’s
assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay the whole of the share capital, the assets will be
distributed so that the losses are borne by BTG shareholders in proportion to the par value of the shares
held by them.
Calls on Shares and Forfeiture of Shares. BTG’s board of directors may from time to time make calls
upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least
14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain
unpaid are subject to forfeiture.
Redemption, Repurchase and Surrender of Shares. BTG may issue shares on terms that such shares are
subject to redemption, at BTG’s option or at the option of the holders of these shares, on such terms and in
such manner as may be determined by BTG board of directors and we may also repurchase any of BTG
shares on such terms and in such manner as have been approved by BTG board of directors or by an
ordinary resolution of BTG shareholders. Under the Companies Act, the redemption or repurchase of any
share may be paid out of BTG’s profits or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purpose
of such redemption or repurchase, or out of capital (including share premium account and capital redemption
reserve) if BTG can, immediately following such payment, pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary
course of business. In addition, BTG may accept the surrender of any fully paid share for no consideration.
Variations of Rights of Shares. If at any time BTG’s share capital is divided into different classes of
shares, the rights attached to any class of shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the
shares of that class), whether or not BTG is being wound-up, may be varied with the consent in writing of
the holders of two-thirds of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution
passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class. The rights conferred upon the holders
of the shares of any class issued shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the
shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu
with or subsequent to such existing class of shares, or the redemption or purchase of any shares of any
class by BTG. The rights of the holders of shares shall not be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of
shares with preferred or other rights including, without limitation, the creation of shares with enhanced or
weighted voting rights.
Issuance of Additional Shares. Amended BTG Articles authorizes BTG board of directors to issue
additional ordinary shares from time to time as BTG board of directors shall determine, to the extent of
available authorized but unissued shares.
Amended BTG Articles also authorizes BTG board of directors to establish from time to time one or more
series of preferred shares and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and
rights of that series, including:
the designation of the series;
the number of shares of the series;
the dividend rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights;
the rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences; and
any other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights.
BTG board of directors may issue preferred shares without action by BTG shareholders to the extent
authorized but unissued. Issuance of these shares may dilute the voting power of holders of ordinary shares.
Inspection of Books and Records. Holders of BTG ordinary shares will have no general right under
Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of BTG’s corporate records (other than BTG’s memorandum
and articles of association, special resolutions, and BTG’s register of mortgages and charges). However, we
will provide BTG shareholders with annual audited financial statements. See “Where You Can Find
Additional Information.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Anti-Takeover Provisions. Some provisions of Amended BTG Articles may discourage, delay or prevent
a change of control of BTG or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions
that:
authorize BTG board of directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to designate the
price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preferred shares without any further vote
or action by BTG shareholders; and
limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders.
However, under Cayman Islands law, BTG directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to
them under Amended BTG Articles for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the
best interests of BTG.
Exempted Company. BTG is an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Act. The
Companies Act distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company
that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may
apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially
the same as for an ordinary company except that an exempted company:
does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies;
is not required to open its register of members for inspection;
does not have to hold an annual general meeting;
may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value;
may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are
usually given for 20 years in the first instance);
may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman
Islands;
may register as a limited duration company; and
may register as a segregated portfolio company.
“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the
shareholder on the shares of the company (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the
establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other circumstances in which a
court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).

This section describes the material differences between the rights of BSGA Shareholders before the
consummation of the Business Combination, and the rights of BTG shareholders after the Business
Combination. These differences in shareholder rights result from the differences between the respective
governing documents of BSGA and BTG.
This section does not include a complete description of all differences among such rights, nor does it
include a complete description of such rights. Furthermore, the identification of some of the differences of
these rights as material is not intended to indicate that other differences that may be equally important do
not exist. BSGA Shareholders are urged to carefully read the relevant provisions of the Amended BTG
Articles that will be in effect as of consummation of the Business Combination (which form is included as
Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus). References in this section to the Amended BTG Articles are
references thereto as they will be in effect upon consummation of the Business Combination. However, the
Amended BTG Articles may be amended at any time prior to consummation of the Business Combination by
mutual agreement of BSGA and Bitdeer or after the consummation of the Business Combination by
amendment in accordance with their terms. If the Amended BTG Articles are amended, the below summary
may cease to accurately reflect the Amended BTG Articles as so amended.

costs, charges, expenses, losses, damages or
liabilities incurred or sustained by such Indemnified
Person, other than by reason of such Indemnified
Person’s own dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in
or about the conduct of BTG’s business or affairs
(including as a result of any mistake of judgment) or

authorities or discretions, including without
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any
costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred by such
Indemnified Person in defending (whether
successfully or otherwise) any civil proceedings
concerning BTG or its affairs in any court whether in
the Cayman Islands or elsewhere.
Dividends
Subject to the Business Combination Articles (as
defined in the Existing BSGA Articles), the directors
may, by Resolution of Directors, authorize a
distribution at a time and of an amount they think fit
if they are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that,
immediately after the distribution, the value of
BSGA’s assets will exceed its liabilities and BSGA
will be able to pay its debts as and when they fall
due.
Dividends may be paid in money, shares, or other
property.
BSGA may, by Resolution of Directors, from time to
time pay to the shareholders such interim dividends
as appear to the directors to be justified by the
profits of BSGA, provided always that they are
satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that, immediately
after the distribution, the value of BSGA’s assets
will exceed its liabilities and BSGA will be able to
pay its debts as and when they fall due.
Subject to any rights and restrictions for the time
being attached to any shares, the directors may from
time to time declare dividends (including interim
dividends) and other distributions on shares in issue
and authorize payment of the same out of the funds
of BTG lawfully available therefor. Subject to any
rights and restrictions for the time being attached to
any shares, BTG by ordinary resolution may declare
dividends, but no dividend shall exceed the amount
recommended by the directors. Any dividend
payable in cash to the holder of shares may be paid
in any manner determined by the directors.
Winding up
BSGA may by a Resolution of Members or by a
Resolution of Directors appoint a voluntary
liquidator.
If BTG shall be wound up the liquidator may, with
the sanction of a special resolution and any other
sanction required by the Companies Act, divide
amongst the members in specie or in kind the whole
or any part of the assets of BTG (whether they shall
consist of property of the same kind or not) and may
for that purpose value any assets and determine how
the division shall be carried out as between the
members or different classes of members. The
liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole
or any part of such assets in trustees upon such
trusts for the benefit of the members as the
liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but
so that no member shall be compelled to accept any
asset upon which there is a liability.
If BTG shall be wound up, and the assets available
for
265 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BSGA
BTG
distribution amongst the members shall be
insufficient to repay the whole of the share capital,
such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as
may be, the losses shall be borne by the members in
proportion to the par value of the shares held by
them. If in a winding up the assets available for
distribution amongst the members shall be more than
sufficient to repay the whole of the share capital at
the commencement of the winding up, the surplus
shall be distributed amongst the members in
proportion to the par value of the shares held by
them at the commencement of the winding up
subject to a deduction from those shares in respect
of which there are monies due, of all monies payable
to BTG for unpaid calls or otherwise.
Supermajority Voting Provisions
None.
A special resolution, requiring the affirmative vote of
a majority of at least two-thirds of such members as,
being entitled to do so, vote in person or, where
proxies are allowed, by proxy at a general meeting of
which notice specifying the intention to propose the
resolution as a special resolution has been duly
given, is required to:
(a) alter or amend the Amended BTG Articles;
(b) fix and determine the variations in the relative
rights (including, without limitation, voting, dividend
and redemption rights), restrictions, preferences,
privileges and payment obligations as between the
different classes;
(c) modify the rights attached to any such class
whenever the capital of BTG is divided into different
classes;
(d) change BTG’s registration to a jurisdiction
outside the Cayman Islands;
(e) reduce BTG’s share capital and any capital
redemption reserve; and
(f) in a winding up, direct the liquidator to divide
amongst the shareholders the assets of BTG, value
the assets for that purpose and determine how the
division will be carried out between the shareholders
or different classes of shareholders.
Anti-Takeover Provisions
Without prejudice to any special rights previously
conferred on the holders of any existing Preferred
Shares, any Preferred Shares may be issued with
such preferred, deferred or other special rights or
such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend,
voting or otherwise as the directors may from time
to time determine subject to Regulation 24.7 of the
Existing BSGA Articles.
The provision of the Amended BTG Articles
authorizes the board of directors to issue and set the
voting and other rights of preferred shares from time
to time in their absolute discretion and without
approval of the members.

Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, BTG will have, based on the assumptions set out
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, up to 112,869,011 BTG Ordinary Shares issued and
outstanding, consisting of 64,434,457 BTG Class A Ordinary Shares and 48,434,554 BTG Class V Ordinary
Shares. All of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares issued to the BSGA Shareholders in connection with the
Business Combination will be freely transferable by persons other than by Sponsor or BSGA’s, BTG’s or
Bitdeer’s affiliates without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. Additionally, the
Bitdeer shareholders will receive 60,324,319 BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, approximately 54.3% of which will
be freely transferable immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination. Sales of substantial
amounts of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market
prices of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. Prior to the Business Combination, there has been no public
market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. BTG has applied for listing of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares on
Nasdaq, but there can be no assurance that a regular trading market will develop in the BTG Class A
Ordinary Shares.
Lock-up Agreements
Bitdeer has agreed to cause substantial shareholders of Bitdeer to enter into a lock-up agreement for a
period of 180 days after the consummation of the Business Combination, not to offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the lock-up shares, enter into a transaction that
would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in
part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such lock-up securities, whether any of these
transactions are to be settled by delivery of any such lock-up shares, in cash or otherwise, publicly disclose
the intention to make any offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to enter into any transaction, swap, hedge or
other arrangement, or engage in any short sales with respect to any security of BTG. The lock-up agreement
shall contain an early release mechanism where 5% of the lock-up shares shall be released prior to the
expiration of the 180-day period if certain conditions are met.
Rule 144
Pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”), a person who has beneficially owned
restricted BTG Ordinary Shares for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities; provided that
(i) such person is not deemed to have been one of BTG’s affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the
three months preceding, a sale and (ii) BTG is subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements
for at least three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act during the 12 months (or such shorter period as it was required to file reports) preceding the
sale.
Persons who have beneficially owned restricted BTG Ordinary Shares for at least six months but who
are BTG’s affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject
to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only
a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of:
one percent (1%) of the total number of BTG Ordinary Shares then issued and outstanding; or
the average weekly reported trading volume of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares during the four
calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.
Sales by BTG’s affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice
requirements and to the availability of current public information about BTG.
Restrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies
Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than
business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell
company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following
conditions are met:
the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;

the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as
applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file
such reports and materials); and
at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed Form 20-F type information with the
SEC, which is expected to be filed promptly after consummation of the Business Combination,
reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual covenants set forth herein, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Definitions. Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, all capitalized terms used but not defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the A&R Merger Agreement.
2. Amendments.
2.1. Outside Closing Date. Section 13.1(b) of the A&R Merger Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the following:
“(b) by either SPAC or the Company if the Acquisition Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the earlier of (i) June 1, 2023 and (ii) the then applicable deadline for SPAC to complete a
Business Combination (as such term is defined in SPAC’s Organizational Documents) in
accordance with its Organizational Documents (the “Outside Closing Date”); provided that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13.1(b) shall not be available to any
party whose breach of or failure to perform any provision of this Agreement has been the primary
cause of the failure of the Acquisition Closing to be consummated before the Outside Closing
Date;”
2.2. Covenant of All Parties Hereto. The following shall be added as Section 10.7 of the A&R
Merger Agreement:
“10.7 Additional Loans. The Company agrees to make to SPAC, and SPAC agrees to borrow
from the Company, certain tranches of loans in such principal amount as set forth in Schedule II-A
(collectively, the “Additional Loans”). The Company shall, on each applicable disbursement date
as
A-3-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
set forth in Schedule II-A, pay such principal amount by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to a bank account designated by SPAC, provided that if the applicable disbursement date
would fall on the Initial Closing Date, the applicable disbursement date will be modified to occur
one (1) Business Day prior to the Initial Closing Date. Each of the Additional Loans shall be non-
interest bearing and only become repayable upon the Acquisition Closing, it being understood and
agreed that if the Acquisition Closing does not occur, SPAC will not repay such Additional Loans.
Without prejudice to the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Additional
Loans are intended to, among other things, fund the SPAC’s working capital and any and all costs
and expenses incurred by the SPAC Parties under SPAC’s Organizational Documents and the
Investment Management Trust Agreement or otherwise due to the extension of the period of time
available for SPAC to consummate a Business Combination (as such term is defined in SPAC’s
Organizational Documents) for up to twelve (12) months following the date of December 14, 2022.
For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, SPAC
shall have the right to take all necessary actions to extend the period of time available for SPAC to
consummate a Business Combination (as such term is defined in SPAC’s Organizational
Documents).”
2.3. Third Party Beneficiaries. Section 14.13 of the A&R Merger Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the following:
“Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer
upon or give any Person, other than the parties hereto, any right or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing (a) in the event the
Acquisition Closing occurs, the present and former officers and directors of the SPAC Parties (and
their respective successors, heirs and representatives) and each of their respective Affiliates are
intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, Section 8.7; (b) the past, present and future
directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners, stockholders, Affiliates, agents,
attorneys, advisors and representatives any party, and any Affiliate of any of the foregoing (and

enforce, Section 14.16 and Section 14.17; and (c) Sponsor is an intended third-party beneficiary of,
and may enforce, Section 10.6 and Section 10.7.”

A&R Merger Agreement.
3. No Other Amendments. The parties hereto agree that all other provisions of the A&R Merger
Agreement shall, subject to the amendments expressly set forth in Section 2 of this Amendment, continue
unmodified, in full force and effect and constitute legal and binding obligations of the parties in accordance
with their terms. This Amendment is limited precisely as written and shall not be deemed to be an amendment
to any other term or condition of the A&R Merger Agreement or any of the documents referred to therein.
This Amendment forms an integral and inseparable part of the A&R Merger Agreement.
4. References. Each reference to “this Agreement,” “hereof,” “herein,” “hereunder,” “hereby” and each
other similar reference contained in the A&R Merger Agreement shall, effective from the date of this
Amendment, refer to the A&R Merger Agreement as amended by this Amendment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, references to the date of the A&R Merger Agreement and references in the A&R Merger
Agreement, as amended hereby, to “the date hereof,” “the date of this Agreement” and other similar
references shall in all instances continue to refer to December 15, 2021 or May 30, 2022, as the case may be,
and references to the date of this Amendment and “as of the date of this Amendment” shall refer to
December 2, 2022.
5. Effect of Amendment. This Amendment shall form a part of the A&R Merger Agreement for all
purposes, and each party thereto and hereto shall be bound hereby. From and after the execution of this
Amendment by the parties hereto, any reference to the A&R Merger Agreement shall be deemed a reference
to the A&R Merger Agreement as amended hereby. This Amendment shall be deemed to be in full force and
effect from and after the execution of this Amendment by the parties hereto.

A COMPANY LIMITED BY SHARES
Amended and Restated on [•]
REGISTERED SHARES
Every Shareholder is entitled to a certificate signed by a Director or officer of the Company, or any
other person authorised by Resolution of Directors, or under the Seal specifying the number of Shares
held by him and the signature of the Directors, officer or authorised person and the Seal may be
facsimiles.
Any Shareholder receiving a certificate shall indemnify and hold the Company and its Directors and
officers harmless from any loss or liability which it or they may incur by reason of any wrongful or
fraudulent use or representation made by any person by virtue of the possession thereof. If a
certificate for Shares is worn out or lost it may be renewed on production of the worn out certificate or
on satisfactory proof of its loss together with such indemnity as may be required by Resolution of
Directors.
If several Eligible Persons are registered as joint holders of any Shares, any one of such Eligible
Persons may give an effectual receipt for any Distribution.
SHARES
Shares and other Securities may be issued at such times, to such Eligible Persons, for such
consideration and on such terms as the Directors may by Resolution of Directors determine.
Section 46 of the Act (Pre-emptive rights) does not apply to the Company.
A Share may be issued for consideration in any form, including money, a promissory note, or other
written obligation to contribute money or property, real property, personal property (including goodwill
and know-how), services rendered or a contract for future services. Bonus Shares are issued for no
consideration and are considered fully paid for on issue.
The consideration for a Share with par value shall not be less than the par value of the Share. If a Share
with par value is issued for consideration less than the par value, the person to whom the Share is
issued is liable to pay to the Company an amount equal to the difference between the issue price and
the par value.
No Shares or part thereof may be issued for a consideration other than money, unless a Resolution of
Directors has been passed stating:
the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares;
the determination of the Directors of the reasonable present cash value of the non-money
consideration for the issue; and
that, in the opinion of the Directors, the present cash value of the non-money consideration
for the issue is not less than the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares.
The consideration paid for any Share, whether a par value Share or a no par value Share, shall not be
treated as a liability or debt of the Company for the purposes of
the solvency test in Regulations 3 and 18; and

sections 197 and 209 of the Act.
The Company shall keep a register (the “register of members”) containing:
the names and addresses of the persons who hold Shares;
the number of each class and series of Shares held by each Shareholder;
the date on which the name of each Shareholder was entered in the register of members; and
the date on which any Eligible Person ceased to be a Shareholder.
except if the Company becomes listed on a recognized exchange the register of members may keep such
other information as shall be approved by a Resolution of Shareholders.
The register of members may be in any such form as the Directors may approve, but if it is in magnetic,
electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence of its
contents. Until the Directors otherwise determine, the magnetic, electronic or other data storage form
shall be the original register of members.
A Share is deemed to be issued when the name of the Shareholder is entered in the register of members.
REDEMPTION OF SHARES AND TREASURY SHARES
The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its own Shares save that the
Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own Shares without the consent of
Shareholders whose Shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired unless the Company
is permitted by the Act or any other provision in the Memorandum or Articles to purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire the Shares without their consent.
The Company may acquire its own fully paid shares for no consideration if the shares are surrendered
to the Company in writing by the shareholder to whom the shares are registered.
The Company may only offer to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Shares if the Resolution of
Directors authorising the purchase, redemption or other acquisition contains a statement that the
Directors are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the acquisition the value of the
Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall
due.
Sections 60 (Process for acquisition of own Shares), 61 (Offer to one or more shareholders) and 62
(Shares redeemed otherwise than at the option of company) of the Act shall not apply to the
Company.
Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires pursuant to this Regulation may be
cancelled or held as Treasury Shares except to the extent that such Shares are in excess of 50 percent
of the issued Shares in which case they shall be cancelled but they shall be available for reissue.
All rights and obligations attaching to a Treasury Share are suspended and shall not be exercised by
the Company while it holds the Share as a Treasury Share.
Treasury Shares may be transferred by the Company on such terms and conditions (not otherwise
inconsistent with the Memorandum and the Articles) as the Company may by Resolution of Directors
determine.
Where Shares are held by another body corporate of which the Company holds, directly or indirectly,
Shares having more than 50 percent of the votes in the election of Directors of the other body
corporate, all rights and obligations attaching to the Shares held by the other body corporate are
suspended and shall not be exercised by the other body corporate.

with the written consent of the named mortgagee or chargee or anyone authorised to act on
his behalf; or
upon evidence satisfactory to the Directors of the discharge of the liability secured by the
mortgage or charge and the issue of such indemnities as the Directors shall consider
necessary or desirable.
Whilst particulars of a mortgage or charge over Shares are entered in the register of members pursuant
to this Regulation:
no transfer of any Share the subject of those particulars shall be effected;
the Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such Share; and
no replacement certificate shall be issued in respect of such Shares,
without the written consent of the named mortgagee or chargee.
FORFEITURE
Shares that are not fully paid on issue are subject to the forfeiture provisions set forth in this
Regulation and for this purpose Shares issued for a promissory note, other written obligation to
contribute money or property or a contract for future services are deemed to be not fully paid.
A written notice of call specifying the date for payment to be made shall be served on the Shareholder
who defaults in making payment in respect of the Shares.
The written notice of call referred to in Sub-Regulation 5.2 shall name a further date not earlier than the
expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice on or before which the payment required by
the notice is to be made and shall contain a statement that in the event of non-payment at or before the
time named in the notice the Shares, or any of them, in respect of which payment is not made will be
liable to be forfeited.
Where a written notice of call has been issued pursuant to Sub-Regulation 5.3 and the requirements of
the notice have not been complied with, the Directors may, at any time before tender of payment, forfeit
and cancel the Shares to which the notice relates.
The Company is under no obligation to refund any moneys to the Shareholder whose Shares have
been cancelled pursuant to Sub-Regulation 5.4 and that Shareholder shall be discharged from any
further obligation to the Company.
TRANSFER OF SHARES
Subject to the Memorandum, except for shares which are listed on a recognized exchange, Shares may
be transferred by a written instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and containing the name and
address of the transferee, which shall be sent to the Company for registration. Shares of the Company
which are listed on a recognized exchange shall be transferred in accordance with the laws, rules,
procedures and other requirements applicable to registered shares on the recognized exchange and
Listed Companies and Funds Regulations.
The transfer of a Share is effective when the name of the transferee is entered on the register of
members.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If the Directors of the Company are satisfied that an instrument of transfer relating to Shares has been
signed but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, they may resolve by Resolution of
Directors:
to accept such evidence of the transfer of Shares as they consider appropriate; and
that the transferee’s name should be entered in the register of members notwithstanding the
absence of the instrument of transfer.
Subject to the Memorandum, the personal representative of a deceased Shareholder may transfer a
Share even though the personal representative is not a Shareholder at the time of the transfer.
MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS
The Directors may convene meetings of the Shareholders at such times and in such manner and places
within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Directors consider desirable, however, the failure to
satisfy this Regulation does not invalidate the meeting.
Upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to exercise 30 percent or more of the voting rights in
respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested the Directors shall convene a meeting of
Shareholders.
The Directors convening a meeting shall give not less than 7 days’ notice of a meeting of Shareholders
to:
those Shareholders whose names on the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in the
register of members of the Company and are entitled to vote at the meeting; and
the other Directors.
The Directors convening a meeting of Shareholders may fix as the record date for determining those
Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the meeting the date of notice is given of the meeting, or such
other date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the notice.
A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if
Shareholders holding at least 90 percent of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at
the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a Shareholder at
the meeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares which that Shareholder holds.
The inadvertent failure of the Directors to give notice of a meeting to a Shareholder, or the fact that a
Shareholder has not received notice, does not invalidate the meeting.
A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak and vote on

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following applies where Shares are jointly owned:
if two or more persons hold Shares jointly each of them may be present in person or by proxy
at a meeting of Shareholders and may speak as a Shareholder;
if only one of the joint owners is present in person or by proxy he may vote on behalf of all
joint owners; and
if two or more of the joint owners are present in person or by proxy they must vote as one.
A Shareholder shall be deemed to be present at a meeting of Shareholders if he participates by
telephone or other electronic means and all Shareholders participating in the meeting are able to hear
each other.
A meeting of Shareholders is duly constituted if, at the commencement of the meeting, there are
present in person or by proxy not less than 50 percent of the votes of the Shares entitled to vote on
Resolutions of Shareholders to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single
Shareholder or proxy and then such person may pass a Resolution of Shareholders and a certificate
signed by such person accompanied where such person be a proxy by a copy of the proxy instrument
shall constitute a valid Resolution of Shareholders.
If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if
convened upon the requisition of Shareholders, shall be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand
adjourned to the next business day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting was to have been held at
the same time and place or to such other time and place as the Directors may determine, and if at the
adjourned meeting there are present within one hour from the time appointed for the meeting in person
or by proxy not less than one third of the votes of the Shares or each class or series of Shares entitled
to vote on the matters to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but
otherwise the meeting shall be dissolved.
At every meeting of Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman of the meeting.
If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present at the meeting, the
Shareholders present shall choose one of their numbers to be the chairman. If the Shareholders are
unable to choose a chairman for any reason, then the person representing the greatest number of
voting Shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting shall preside as chairman failing which the
oldest individual Shareholder or representative of a Shareholder present shall take the chair.
The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time, and from
place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business
left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.
At any meeting of the Shareholders the chairman is responsible for deciding in such manner as he
considers appropriate whether any resolution proposed has been carried or not and the result of his
decision shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the meeting. If the chairman
has any doubt as to the outcome of the vote on a proposed resolution, he shall cause a poll to be taken
of all votes cast upon such resolution. If the chairman fails to take a poll then any Shareholder present
in person or by proxy who disputes the announcement by the chairman of the result of any vote may
immediately following such announcement demand that a poll be taken and the chairman shall cause a
poll to be taken. If a poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced to the meeting and
recorded in the minutes of the meeting.
Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Regulation for the appointment of representatives
of Eligible Persons other than individuals the right of any individual to speak for or represent a
Shareholder shall be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by the documents by which,
the Eligible Person is constituted or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the Directors may in good
faith seek legal advice from any qualified person and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction
shall otherwise rule, the Directors may rely and act upon such advice without incurring any liability to
any Shareholder or the Company.
Any Eligible Person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its Directors

or other governing body authorise such individual as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any
meeting of Shareholders or of any class of Shareholders, and the individual so authorised shall be
entitled to exercise the same rights on behalf of the Shareholder which he represents as that
Shareholder could exercise if it were an individual.
The chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any Eligible Person other
than an individual may call for a notarially certified copy of such proxy or authority which shall be
produced within 7 days of being so requested or the votes cast by such proxy or on behalf of such
Eligible Person shall be disregarded.
Directors of the Company may attend and speak at any meeting of Shareholders and at any separate
meeting of the holders of any class or series of Shares.
An action that may be taken by the Shareholders at a meeting may also be taken by a resolution
consented to in writing, without the need for any notice, but if any Resolution of Shareholders is
adopted otherwise than by the unanimous written consent of all Shareholders, a copy of such
resolution shall forthwith be sent to all Shareholders not consenting to such resolution. The consent
may be in the form of counterparts, each counterpart being signed by one or more Shareholders. If the
consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution
shall take effect on the earliest date upon which Shareholders holding a sufficient number of votes of
Shares to constitute a Resolution of Shareholders have consented to the resolution by signed
counterparts.
If the Company shall have only one Shareholder, the provisions herein contained for meetings of the
Shareholders shall not apply and in lieu of minutes of a meeting shall record in writing and sign a note
or memorandum of all matters requiring a Resolution of Shareholders. Such a note or memorandum shall
constitute sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

individual ceases to exist or otherwise ceases to hold office prior to the expiration of his term of office.
Where the Company only has one Shareholder who is an individual and that Shareholder is also the
sole Director of the Company, the sole Shareholder/Director may, by instrument in writing, nominate a
person who is not disqualified from being a Director of the Company as a reserve Director of the
Company to act in the place of the sole Director in the event of his death.
The nomination of a person as a reserve Director of the Company ceases to have effect if:

other legal means or not used for more than 10 years) and residential addresses of the persons
who are Directors of the Company or who have been nominated as reserve Directors of the

of its contents. Until a Resolution of Directors determining otherwise is passed, the magnetic,
electronic or other data storage shall be the original register of Directors.

managing, and for directing and supervising, the business and affairs of the Company. The Directors
may pay all expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the incorporation of the Company
and may exercise all such powers of the Company as are not by the Act or by the Memorandum or the
Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders.
Each Director shall exercise his powers for a proper purpose and shall not act or agree to the Company
acting in a manner that contravenes the Memorandum, the Articles or the Act. Each Director, in
exercising his powers or performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith in what the
Directors believes to be the best interests of the Company.
If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company, a Director of the Company may,
when exercising powers or performing duties as a Director, act in a manner which he believes is in the
best interests of the holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.
Any Director which is a body corporate may appoint any individual as its duly authorised
representative for the purpose of representing it at meetings of the Directors, with respect to the
signing of consents or otherwise.
The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.
The Directors may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company to incur
indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to secure indebtedness, liabilities or obligations whether of
the Company or of any third party.
All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all
receipts for moneys paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise
executed, as the case may be, in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by Resolution of
Directors.
For the purposes of Section 175 (Disposition of assets) of the Act, the Directors may by Resolution of
Directors determine that any sale, transfer, lease, exchange or other disposition is in the usual or
regular course of the business carried on by the Company and such determination is, in the absence of
fraud, conclusive.
PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS
Any one Director of the Company may call a meeting of the Directors by sending a written notice to
each other Director.
The Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner
and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Directors may determine to be necessary
or desirable.
A Director is deemed to be present at a meeting of Directors if he participates by telephone or other
electronic means and all Directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.
A Director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of Directors, but a meeting of
Directors held without 3 days’ notice having been given to all Directors shall be valid if all the
Directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and for this
purpose the presence of a Director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that Director. The
inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to a Director, or the fact that a Director has not received
the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.
A Director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a Director and the
alternate shall be entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the Directors who appointed him and to
vote in place of the Directors until the appointment lapses or is terminated. Appointment and
termination of an alternate shall not be effective until the instrument appointing and terminating the
alternate director has been given to the Company.
A meeting of Directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting there
are present in person or by alternate not less than one-half of the total number of Directors, unless
there are only 2 Directors in which case the quorum is 2.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If the Company has only one Director the provisions herein contained for meetings of Directors do not
apply and such sole Director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as are
not by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders. In lieu of
minutes of a meeting the sole Director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all
matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient
evidence of such resolution for all purposes.
At meetings of Directors at which the Chairman of the Board is present, he shall preside as chairman of
the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present, the
Directors present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.
An action that may be taken by the Directors or a committee of Directors at a meeting may also be
taken by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of Directors consented to in writing
by all Directors or by all members of the committee, as the case may be, without the need for any
notice. The consent may be in the form of counterparts each counterpart being signed by one or more
Directors. If the consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then
the resolution shall take effect on the date upon which the last Director has consented to the
resolution by signed counterparts.
COMMITTEES
The Directors may, by Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of
one or more Directors, and delegate one or more of their powers, including the power to affix the Seal,
to the committee.

to amend the Memorandum or the Articles;
to designate committees of Directors;
to delegate powers to a committee of Directors;
to appoint or remove Directors;
to appoint or remove an agent;
to approve a plan of merger, consolidation or arrangement;
to make a declaration of solvency or to approve a liquidation plan; or
to make a determination that immediately after a proposed Distribution the value of the
Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the Company will be able to pay its debts as
they fall due.
Sub-Regulation 11.2(b) and (c) do not prevent a committee of Directors, where authorised by the
Resolution of Directors appointing such committee or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors, from
appointing a sub-committee and delegating powers exercisable by the committee to the sub-committee.
The meetings and proceedings of each committee of Directors consisting of 2 or more Directors shall
be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles regulating the proceedings of
Directors so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the Resolution of Directors
establishing the committee.
Where the Directors delegate their powers to a committee of Directors they remain responsible for the
exercise of that power by the committee, unless they believed on reasonable grounds at all times before
the exercise of the power that the committee would exercise the power in conformity with the duties
imposed on Directors of the Company under the Act.

CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
A Director shall forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered
into or to be entered into by the Company, disclose the interest to the Board bringing it to the attention
of every Director on the Board. Where a Director’s interest in a transaction is not disclosed in
accordance with this Regulation the transaction is voidable by the Company.
For the purposes of Sub-Regulation 13.1, a disclosure to all other Directors to the effect that a Director
is a member, Director or officer of another named entity or has a fiduciary relationship with respect to
the entity or a named individual and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction which may, after
the date of the entry into the transaction or disclosure of the interest, be entered into with that entity
or individual, is a sufficient disclosure of interest in relation to that transaction.
Notwithstanding Regulation 13.1, a transaction entered into by the Company is not voidable by the
Company if:
the material facts of the interest of the Directors in the transaction are known by the
Shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting of Shareholders and the transaction is approved or
ratified by a Resolution of Shareholders; or
the Company received fair value for the transaction, and such determination of fair value is
made on the basis of the information known to the Company and the interested Director at the
time that the transaction was entered into.
A Director of the Company who is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the
Company may:
vote on a matter relating to the transaction;
attend a meeting of Directors at which a matter relating to the transaction arises and be
included among the Directors present at the meeting for the purposes of a quorum; and
sign a document on behalf of the Company, or do any other thing in his capacity as a Director,
that relates to the transaction.
INDEMNIFICATION
Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company shall indemnify against all expenses,
including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably
incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings any person who:
is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
the person is or was a Director of the Company; or
is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a Director of, or in any other capacity is or
was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.
The indemnity in Sub-Regulation 14.1 only applies if the person acted honestly and in good faith with
a view to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had
no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.
For the purposes of Sub-Regulation 14.2, a Director acts in the best interests of the Company if he
acts in the best interests of
the Company’s holding company; or
a Shareholder or Shareholders of the Company;
in either case, in the circumstances specified in Sub-Regulation 9.3 or the Act, as the case may be.

to the best interests of the Company and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe
that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the Articles,
unless a question of law is involved.
The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of
a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in
good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had reasonable
cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a Director in defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Directors to repay the amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that the Directors is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company in
accordance with Sub-Regulation 14.1.
Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a former Director in defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the former Director to repay the
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the former Director is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Company in accordance with Sub-Regulation 14.1 and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as
the Company deems appropriate.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section is
not exclusive of any other rights to which the person seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any agreement, Resolution of Shareholders, resolution of
disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as acting in the person’s official capacity and as to acting
in another capacity while serving as a Director of the Company.
If a person referred to in Sub-Regulation 14.1 has been successful in defence of any proceedings
referred to in Sub-Regulation 14.1, the person is entitled to be indemnified against all expenses,
including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably
incurred by the person in connection with the proceedings.
The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person who is or was a
Director, officer or liquidator of the Company, or who at the request of the Company is or was serving
as a Director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another company or
a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against the person
and incurred by the person in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had the
power to indemnify the person against the liability as provided in the Articles.

The Company shall keep the following documents at the office of its registered agent:
the Memorandum and the Articles;
the register of members, or a copy of the register of members;

Shares. Such commissions may be satisfied by the payment of cash or the lodgment of fully or partly
paid-up Shares or partly in one way and partly in the other. The Company may also pay such brokerage
as may be lawful on any issue of Shares.
The Directors may refuse to accept any application for Shares, and may accept any application in
whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason.
CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES AND CLASS V ORDINARY SHARES
Subject to Article 18, holders of Class A Ordinary Shares and Class V Ordinary Shares shall at all times
vote together as one class on all resolutions submitted to a vote by the Members. Each Class A
Ordinary Share shall entitle the holder thereof to one (1) vote on all matters subject to vote at general
meetings or class meetings of the Company, and each Class V Ordinary Share shall entitle the holder
thereof to ten (10) votes on all matters subject to vote at general meetings or class meetings of the
Company.
Class V Ordinary Shares shall only be held by Founder Entities; provided, however, the Class V
Ordinary Shares are deemed to be “held by Founder Entities” if the Depositary holds Class V Ordinary
Shares and issues RADSs to Founder Entities representing such Class V Ordinary Shares. Each Class V
Ordinary Share shall automatically convert into one (1) Class A Ordinary Share in accordance with
these Articles (as adjusted for share splits, share combinations and similar transactions) on any
transfer by a Founder Entity to a Person (that is not a Founder Entity) of any Beneficial Ownership of,
or economic interest in, such Class V Ordinary Share or the control over the voting rights attached to
such Class V Ordinary Share (through any contracts, voting proxies or otherwise); provided, however,
that on the grant by a Founder Entity of any lien, charge, mortgage or other encumbrance (a “Security
Interest”) over the Class V Ordinary Shares held by it, unless and until the legal ownership of such
shares is transferred pursuant to such Security Interest (including any enforcement or foreclosure in
connection therewith).
Each Class V Ordinary Share is convertible into one (1) Class A Ordinary Share (as adjusted for share
splits, share combinations and similar transactions) at any time at the option of the holder thereof.
Each Class V Ordinary Share held by a Founder Entity shall automatically convert into one (1) Class A
Ordinary Share in accordance with these Articles (as adjusted for share splits, share combinations and
similar transactions) upon the death or Incapacity of the Founder.
Any conversion of Class V Ordinary Shares into Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to these Articles
shall be effected by means of the re-designation of each relevant Class V Ordinary Share as a Class A
Ordinary Share. Such conversion shall become effective forthwith upon entries being made in the
Register to record the re-designation of the relevant Class V Ordinary Shares as Class A Ordinary
Shares.
Save and except for voting rights and conversion rights as set out in Articles 12 to 15 (inclusive), the
Class A Ordinary Shares and the Class V Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu with one another and
shall have the same rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions.
MODIFICATION OF RIGHTS
Whenever the capital of the Company is divided into different Classes, the rights attached to any such
Class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that Class), whether or not the
Company is being wound-up, may be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of two-thirds of
the issued Shares of that Class or with the sanction of a Special Resolution passed at a separate
meeting of the holders of the Shares of that Class. To every such separate meeting all the provisions of
these Articles relating to general meetings of the Company or to the proceedings thereat shall, mutatis
mutandis, apply, except that the necessary quorum shall be one or more Persons holding or
representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal or par value amount of the issued Shares of the
relevant Class (but so that if at any adjourned meeting of such holders a quorum as above defined is
not present, those Shareholders who are present shall form a quorum) and that, subject to any rights or
restrictions for the

25. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
time being attached to the Shares of that Class, every Shareholder of the Class shall on a poll have one
vote for each Share of the Class held by him. For the purposes of this Article the Directors may treat all
the Classes or any two or more Classes as forming one Class if they consider that all such Classes
would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration, but in any other case shall
treat them as separate Classes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 18, if holders
of Class A Ordinary Shares and Class V Ordinary Shares vote as one class, each Class A Ordinary
Share shall entitle the holder thereof to one (1) vote and each Class V Ordinary Share shall entitle the
holder thereof to ten (10) votes on all matters subject to vote at meetings of the holders of Shares of
the relevant Class(es).
The rights conferred upon the holders of the Shares of any Class issued with preferred or other rights
shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issuance of the Shares of that Class, be
deemed to be varied by, inter alia, the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu with or
subsequent to such existing Class of Shares, or the redemption or purchase of any Shares of any Class
by the Company. The rights of the holders of Shares shall not be deemed to be varied by the creation
or issue of Shares with preferred or other rights including, without limitation, the creation of Shares
with enhanced or weighted voting rights.
CERTIFICATES
Every Person whose name is entered as a Member in the Register may, without payment and upon its
written request, request a certificate within two calendar months after allotment or lodgement of
transfer (or within such other period as the conditions of issue shall provide) in the form determined by
the Directors. All certificates shall specify the Share or Shares held by that Person, provided that in
respect of a Share or Shares held jointly by several Persons the Company shall not be bound to issue
more than one certificate, and delivery of a certificate for a Share to one of several joint holders shall be
sufficient delivery to all. All certificates for Shares shall be delivered personally or sent through the
post addressed to the Member entitled thereto at the Member’s registered address as appearing in the
Register.
Every share certificate of the Company shall bear legends required under the applicable laws, including
the Securities Act.
Any two or more certificates representing Shares of any one Class held by any Member may at the
Member’s request be cancelled and a single new certificate for such Shares issued in lieu on payment
(if the Directors shall so require) of one U.S. dollar (US$1.00) or such smaller sum as the Directors shall
determine.
If a share certificate shall be damaged or defaced or alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, a
new certificate representing the same Shares may be issued to the relevant Member upon request,
subject to delivery up of the old certificate or (if alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed)
compliance with such conditions as to evidence and indemnity and the payment of out-of-pocket
expenses of the Company in connection with the request as the Directors may think fit.
In the event that Shares are held jointly by several Persons, any request may be made by any one of
the joint holders and if so made shall be binding on all of the joint holders.
FRACTIONAL SHARES
The Directors may issue fractions of a Share and, if so issued, a fraction of a Share shall be subject to
and carry the corresponding fraction of liabilities (whether with respect to nominal or par value,
premium, contributions, calls or otherwise), limitations, preferences, privileges, qualifications,
restrictions, rights (including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, voting and
participation rights) and other attributes of a whole Share. If more than one fraction of a Share of the
same Class is issued to or acquired by the same Shareholder such fractions shall be accumulated.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
LIEN
The Company has a first and paramount lien on every Share (whether or not fully paid) for all amounts
(whether presently payable or not) payable at a fixed time or called in respect of that Share. The
Company also has a first and paramount lien on every Share registered in the name of a Person
indebted or under liability to the Company (whether he is the sole registered holder of a Share or one of
two or more joint holders) for all amounts owing by him or his estate to the Company (whether or not
presently payable). The Directors may at any time declare a Share to be wholly or in part exempt from
the provisions of this Article. The Company’s lien on a Share extends to any amount payable in respect
of it, including but not limited to dividends.
The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors in their absolute discretion think fit, any Share
on which the Company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless an amount in respect of which the
lien exists is presently payable nor until the expiration of fourteen calendar days after a notice in
writing, demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is
presently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the Share, or the
Persons entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy.
For giving effect to any such sale the Directors may authorize a Person to transfer the Shares sold to
the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Shares comprised in any
such transfer and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his
title to the Shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the
sale.
The proceeds of the sale after deduction of expenses, fees and commissions incurred by the Company
shall be received by the Company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of
which the lien exists as is presently payable, and the residue shall (subject to a like lien for sums not
presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the Person entitled to the
Shares immediately prior to the sale.
CALLS ON SHARES
Subject to the terms of the allotment, the Directors may from time to time make calls upon the
Shareholders in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares, and each Shareholder shall (subject to
receiving at least fourteen calendar days’ notice specifying the time or times of payment) pay to the
Company at the time or times so specified the amount called on such Shares. A call shall be deemed to
have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorizing such call was passed.
The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof.
If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the
Person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest upon the sum at the rate of eight percent per
annum from the day appointed for the payment thereof to the time of the actual payment, but the
Directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of that interest wholly or in part.
The provisions of these Articles as to the liability of joint holders and as to payment of interest shall
apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable
at a fixed time, whether on account of the amount of the Share, or by way of premium, as if the same
had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.
The Directors may make arrangements with respect to the issue of partly paid Shares for a difference
between the Shareholders, or the particular Shares, in the amount of calls to be paid and in the times of
payment.
The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Shareholder willing to advance the same all or any
part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any partly paid Shares held by him, and upon all or any
of the moneys so advanced may (until the same would, but for such advance, become presently
payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding without the sanction of an Ordinary Resolution, eight
percent per annum) as may be agreed upon between the Shareholder paying the sum in advance and
the Directors. No such sum paid in advance of calls shall entitle the Member paying such sum to any
portion

of a dividend declared in respect of any period prior to the date upon which such sum would, but for
such payment, become presently payable.
FORFEITURE OF SHARES
If a Shareholder fails to pay any call or instalment of a call in respect of partly paid Shares on the day
appointed for payment, the Directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of such
call or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or
instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued.
The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of fourteen calendar days from the
date of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state
that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the Shares in respect of which the call
was made will be liable to be forfeited.
If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with, any Share in respect of
which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment required by notice has
been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect.
A forfeited Share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the
Directors think fit, and at any time before a sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such
terms as the Directors think fit.
A Person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Shareholder in respect of the forfeited
Shares, but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of
forfeiture were payable by him to the Company in respect of the Shares forfeited, but his liability shall
cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of the amount unpaid on the Shares forfeited.
A certificate in writing under the hand of a Director that a Share has been duly forfeited on a date
stated in the certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the facts in the declaration as against all
Persons claiming to be entitled to the Share.
The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for a Share on any sale or disposition
thereof pursuant to the provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture and may execute a transfer of the
Share in favor of the Person to whom the Share is sold or disposed of and that Person shall be
registered as the holder of the Share and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase
money, if any, nor shall his title to the Shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the
proceedings in reference to the disposition or sale.
The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum
which by the terms of issue of a Share becomes due and payable, whether on account of the amount of
the Share, or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and
notified.
TRANSFER OF SHARES
The instrument of transfer of any Share shall be in writing and in any usual or common form or such
other form as the Directors may, in their absolute discretion, approve and be executed by or on behalf
of the transferor and if in respect of a nil or partly paid up Share, or if so required by the Directors,
shall also be executed on behalf of the transferee and shall be accompanied by the certificate (if any) of
the Shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show
the right of the transferor to make the transfer. The transferor shall be deemed to remain a Shareholder
until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register in respect of the relevant Shares.

The Directors may in their absolute discretion decline to register any transfer of Shares which is
not fully paid up or on which the Company has a lien.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Directors may also decline to register any transfer of any Share unless:
the instrument of transfer is lodged with the Company, accompanied by the certificate for
the Shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require
to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one Class of Shares;
the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required;
in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the Share is
to be transferred does not exceed four; and
a fee of such maximum sum as the Designated Stock Exchange may determine to be
payable, or such lesser sum as the Board of Directors may from time to time require, is paid
to the Company in respect thereof.
The registration of transfers may, on ten calendar days’ notice being given by advertisement in such
one or more newspapers, by electronic means or by any other means in accordance with the
Designated Stock Exchange Rules, be suspended and the Register closed at such times and for such
periods as the Directors may, in their absolute discretion, from time to time determine, provided always
that such registration of transfer shall not be suspended nor the Register closed for more than thirty
calendar days in any calendar year.
All instruments of transfer that are registered shall be retained by the Company. If the Directors refuse
to register a transfer of any Shares, they shall within three calendar months after the date on which the
transfer was lodged with the Company send notice of the refusal to each of the transferor and the
transferee.
TRANSMISSION OF SHARES
The legal personal representative of a deceased sole holder of a Share shall be the only Person
recognized by the Company as having any title to the Share. In the case of a Share registered in the
name of two or more holders, the survivors or survivor, or the legal personal representatives of the
deceased survivor, shall be the only Person recognized by the Company as having any title to the
Share.
Any Person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Shareholder
shall, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the Directors, have
the right either to be registered as a Shareholder in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered
himself, to make such transfer of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Person could have made; but
the Directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would
have had in the case of a transfer of the Share by the deceased or bankrupt Person before the death or
bankruptcy.
A Person becoming entitled to a Share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of a Shareholder shall be
entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the
registered Shareholder, except that he shall not, before being registered as a Shareholder in respect of
the Share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to
meetings of the Company, provided however, that the Directors may at any time give notice requiring
any such Person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the Share, and if the notice is not
complied with within ninety calendar days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all
dividends, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the Share until the requirements of the notice
have been complied with.
REGISTRATION OF EMPOWERING INSTRUMENTS
The Company shall be entitled to charge a fee not exceeding one U.S. dollar (US$1.00) on the
registration of every probate, letters of administration, certificate of death or marriage, power of
attorney, notice in lieu of distringas, or other instrument.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL
The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase the share capital by such sum, to
be divided into Shares of such Classes and amount, as the resolution shall prescribe.
The Company may by Ordinary Resolution:
increase its share capital by new Shares of such amount as it thinks expedient;
consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of a larger amount than its
existing Shares;
subdivide its Shares, or any of them, into Shares of an amount smaller than that fixed by the
Memorandum, provided that in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the
amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced Share shall be the same as it was in case of the Share
from which the reduced Share is derived; and
cancel any Shares that, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or
agreed to be taken by any Person and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of
the Shares so cancelled.
The Company may by Special Resolution reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve in
any manner authorized by law.
REDEMPTION, PURCHASE AND SURRENDER OF SHARES
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act and these Articles, the Company may:
issue Shares that are to be redeemed or are liable to be redeemed at the option of the Shareholder
or the Company. The redemption of Shares shall be effected in such manner and upon such terms
as may be determined, before the issue of such Shares, by either the Board or by the
Shareholders by Special Resolution;
purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) on such terms and in such manner
and terms as have been approved by the Board or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution, or
are otherwise authorized by these Articles; and
make a payment in respect of the redemption or purchase of its own Shares in any manner
permitted by the Companies Act, including out of capital.
The purchase of any Share shall not oblige the Company to purchase any other Share other than as
may be required pursuant to applicable law and any other contractual obligations of the Company.
The holder of the Shares being purchased shall be bound to deliver up to the Company the
certificate(s) (if any) thereof for cancellation and thereupon the Company shall pay to him the purchase
or redemption monies or consideration in respect thereof.
The Directors may accept the surrender for no consideration of any fully paid Share.
TREASURY SHARES
The Directors may, prior to the purchase, redemption or surrender of any Share, determine that such
Share shall be held as a Treasury Share.
The Directors may determine to cancel a Treasury Share or transfer a Treasury Share on such terms as
they think proper (including, without limitation, for nil consideration).
GENERAL MEETINGS
All general meetings other than annual general meetings shall be called extraordinary general meetings.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
62. 
(a) 
The Company may (but shall not be obliged to) in each calendar year hold a general meeting as
its annual general meeting and shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it. The
annual general meeting shall be held at such time and place as may be determined by the
Directors.
At these meetings the report of the Directors (if any) shall be presented.
63. 
(a) 
The Chairman or a majority of the Directors may call general meetings, and they shall on a
Shareholders’ requisition forthwith proceed to convene an extraordinary general meeting of the
Company.
A Shareholders’ requisition is a requisition of Members holding at the date of deposit of the
requisition Shares which carry in aggregate not less than one-third (1/3) of all votes attaching to
all issued and outstanding Shares of the Company that as at the date of the deposit carry the
right to vote at general meetings of the Company.
The requisition must state the objects of the meeting and must be signed by the requisition’s and
deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form each
signed by one or more requisition’s.
If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Shareholders’ requisition, or if the
Directors do not within twenty-one calendar days from the date of the deposit of the requisition
duly proceed to convene a general meeting to be held within a further twenty-one calendar days,
the requisition’s, may themselves convene a general meeting, but any meeting so convened shall
not be held after the expiration of three calendar months after the expiration of the said twenty-
one calendar days.
A general meeting convened as aforesaid by requisition’s shall be convened in the same manner
as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by Directors.
NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS
At least ten (10) calendar days’ notice shall be given for any general meeting. Every notice shall be
exclusive of the day on which it is given or deemed to be given and of the day for which it is given and
shall specify the place (except in the case of a Virtual Meeting), the day and the hour of the meeting
and the general nature of the business and shall be given in the manner hereinafter mentioned or in
such other manner if any as may be prescribed by the Company, provided that a general meeting of the
Company shall, whether or not the notice specified in this Article has been given and whether or not
the provisions of these Articles regarding general meetings have been complied with, be deemed to
have been duly convened if it is so agreed:
in the case of an annual general meeting, by all the Shareholders (or their proxies) entitled to
attend and vote thereat; and
in the case of an extraordinary general meeting, by two-thirds (2/3rd) of the Shareholders having
a right to attend and vote at the meeting, Present at the meeting.
The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by
any Shareholder shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting.
PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS
No business except for the appointment of a chairman for the meeting shall be transacted at any
general meeting unless a quorum of Shareholders is Present at the time when the meeting proceeds to
business. One or more Shareholders holding Shares which carry in aggregate (or representing by
proxy) not less than fifty percent (50%) of all votes attaching to all Shares in issue and entitled to vote
at such general meeting, Present at the meeting, shall be a quorum for all purposes.
If within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not Present, the meeting shall
be dissolved.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If the Directors so determine in respect of a specific general meeting or all general meetings of the
Company, Presence at the relevant general meeting may be by means of Communications Facilities. The
Directors may determine that any general meeting may be held as a Virtual Meeting. The notice of any
general meeting at which Communications Facilities may be utilized (including any Virtual Meeting)
must disclose the Communications Facilities that will be used, including the procedures to be followed
by any Shareholder or other participant of the general meeting utilizing such Communications
Facilities.
The Chairman, if any, shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company.
If there is no such Chairman, or if at any general meeting he is not Present within fifteen minutes after
the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman of the meeting, any
Director or Person nominated by the Directors shall preside as chairman of that meeting, failing which
the Shareholders Present shall choose any Person Present to be chairman of that meeting.
The chairman of any general meeting shall be entitled to participate at any such general meeting by
Communication Facilities, and to act as the chairman of such general meeting, in which event the
following provisions shall apply:
the chairman shall be deemed to be Present at the general meeting; and
if the Communication Facilities fail to enable the chairman of the general meeting to hear and be
heard by other Persons participating in the meeting, then the other Directors Present at the
general meeting shall choose another Director Present to act as chairman of the general meeting
for (or for the remainder of) the general meeting; provided that if no other Director is Present at
the general meeting, or if all the Directors Present decline to take the chair, then the general
meeting shall be automatically adjourned to the same day in the next week and at such time and
place as shall be decided by the Directors.
The chairman of any general meeting at which a quorum is Present may with the consent of the meeting
(and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place,
but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished
at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting, or adjourned meeting, is
adjourned for fourteen calendar days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the
case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an
adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting.
The Directors may cancel or postpone any duly convened general meeting at any time prior to such
meeting, except for general meetings requisitioned by the Shareholders in accordance with these
Articles, for any reason or for no reason, upon notice in writing to Shareholders. A postponement may
be for a stated period of any length or indefinitely as the Directors may determine.
At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of
hands, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) demanded by
the chairman of the meeting or any Shareholder holding not less than ten per cent (10%) of the votes
attaching to the Shares Present at the meeting, and unless a poll is so demanded, a declaration by the
chairman of the meeting that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried, or carried
unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect in the book of the
proceedings of the Company, shall be conclusive evidence of the fact, without proof of the number or
proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution.
If a poll is duly demanded it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman of the meeting directs, and
the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was
demanded.
All questions submitted to a meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution except where a
greater majority is required by these Articles or by the Companies Act. In the case of an equality of
votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of
hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall be entitled to a second or casting vote.

A poll demanded on the election of a chairman of the meeting or on a question of adjournment shall be
taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken at such time as the chairman of
the meeting directs.
VOTES OF SHAREHOLDERS
Subject to any rights and restrictions for the time being attached to any Share, at a general meeting of
the Company, (i) on a show of hands and/or (ii) on a poll, every Shareholder Present at the meeting
shall have one (1) vote for each Class A Ordinary Share and ten (10) votes for each Class V Ordinary
Share of which such Shareholder is the holder, as provided in Article 12.
In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior who tenders a vote whether in person or by proxy (or,
if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative or proxy) shall be
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and for this purpose seniority shall be
determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register.
Shares carrying the right to vote that are held by a Shareholder of unsound mind, or in respect of
whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may be voted, whether on a
show of hands or on a poll, by his committee, or other Person in the nature of a committee appointed
by that court, and any such committee or other Person may vote in respect of such Shares by proxy.
No Shareholder shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting of the Company unless all calls, if any,
or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares carrying the right to vote held by him have
been paid.
On a poll votes may be given either personally or by proxy.
Each Shareholder, other than a recognized clearing house (or its nominee(s)) or depositary (or its
nominee(s)), may only appoint one proxy on a show of hand. The instrument appointing a proxy shall
be in writing under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly authorized in writing or, if the
appointor is a corporation, either under Seal or under the hand of an officer or attorney duly
authorized. A proxy need not be a Shareholder.
An instrument appointing a proxy may be in any usual or common form or such other form as the

Any corporation which is a Shareholder or a Director may by resolution of its directors or other
governing body authorize such Person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the

Company or of any Class of Shareholders provided that, if more than one Person is so authorized, the
authorization shall specify the number and Class of Shares in respect of which each such Person is so
authorized. A Person so authorized pursuant to this Article shall be entitled to exercise the same
powers on behalf of the recognized clearing house (or its nominee(s)) or depositary (or its nominee(s))

follows:
The Company may by Ordinary Resolution appoint any person to be a Director.
The Board may, by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the Directors present and voting at
a Board meeting, appoint any person as a Director, to fill a casual vacancy on the Board or as an
addition to the existing Board.
An appointment of a Director may be on terms that the Director shall automatically retire from
office (unless he has sooner vacated office) at the next or a subsequent annual general meeting
or upon any specified event or after any specified period in a written agreement between the
Company and the Director, if any; but no such term shall be implied in the absence of express
provision. Each Director whose term of office expires shall be eligible for re-election at a meeting
of the Shareholders or re-appointment by the Board.
A Director may be removed from office by Ordinary Resolution, notwithstanding anything in
these Articles or in any agreement between the Company and such Director (but without
prejudice to any claim for damages under such agreement). A vacancy on the Board created by
the removal of a Director under the previous sentence may be filled by Ordinary Resolution or by
the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the remaining Directors present and voting at a Board
meeting.
The Board of Directors may elect and appoint a Chairman by a majority of the Directors then in office.

meetings.
The remuneration of the Directors may be determined by the Directors or by Ordinary Resolution.
The Directors shall be entitled to be paid their travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by
them in going to, attending and returning from meetings of the Directors, or any committee of the
Directors, or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the
Company, or to receive such fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors
from time to time, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other.
ALTERNATE DIRECTOR OR PROXY
Any Director may in writing appoint another Person to be his alternate and, save to the extent provided
otherwise in the form of appointment, such alternate shall have authority to sign written resolutions on
behalf of the appointing Director, but shall not be required to sign such written resolutions where they
have been signed by the appointing director, and to act in such Director’s place at any meeting of the
Directors at which the appointing Director is unable to be present. Every such alternate shall be
entitled to attend and vote at meetings of the Directors as a Director when the Director appointing him
is not personally present and where he is a Director to have a separate vote on behalf of the Director
he is representing in addition to his own vote. A Director may at any time in writing revoke the
appointment of an alternate appointed by him. Such alternate shall be deemed for all purposes to be a
Director and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The remuneration of
such alternate shall be payable out of the remuneration of the Director appointing him and the
proportion thereof shall be agreed between them.
Any Director may appoint any Person, whether or not a Director, to be the proxy of that Director to
attend and vote on his behalf, in accordance with instructions given by that Director, or in the absence
of such instructions at the discretion of the proxy, at a meeting or meetings of the Directors which that
Director is unable to attend personally. The instrument appointing the proxy shall be in writing under
the hand of the appointing Director and shall be in any usual or common form or such other form as the
Directors may approve, and must be lodged with the chairman of the meeting of the Directors at which
such proxy is to be used, or first used, prior to the commencement of the meeting.

provisions for the protection and convenience of Persons dealing with any such Attorney or
Authorized Signatory as the Directors may think fit, and may also authorize any such Attorney or
Authorized Signatory to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretion vested in him.
The Directors may from time to time provide for the management of the affairs of the Company in such
manner as they shall think fit and the provisions contained in the three next following Articles shall not

TABLE OF CONTENTS
A Director who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in a contract or transaction or
proposed contract or transaction with the Company shall declare the nature of his interest at a meeting
of the Directors. A general notice given to the Directors by any Director to the effect that he is a
member of any specified company or firm and is to be regarded as interested in any contract or
transaction which may thereafter be made with that company or firm shall be deemed a sufficient
declaration of interest in regard to any contract so made or transaction so consummated. A Director
may vote in respect of any contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction notwithstanding
that he may be interested therein and if he does so his vote shall be counted and he may be counted in
the quorum at any meeting of the Directors at which any such contract or transaction or proposed
contract or transaction shall come before the meeting for consideration.
A Director may hold any other office or place of profit under the Company (other than the office of
auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and on such terms (as to
remuneration and otherwise) as the Directors may determine and no Director or intending Director shall
be disqualified by his office from contracting with the Company either with regard to his tenure of any
such other office or place of profit or as vendor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or
arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director is in any way
interested be liable to be avoided, nor shall any Director so contracting or being so interested be liable
to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or arrangement by reason of
such Director holding that office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established. A Director,
notwithstanding his interest, may be counted in the quorum present at any meeting of the Directors
whereat he or any other Director is appointed to hold any such office or place of profit under the
Company or whereat the terms of any such appointment are arranged and he may vote on any such
appointment or arrangement.
Any Director may act by himself or through his firm in a professional capacity for the Company, and he
or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director;
provided that nothing herein contained shall authorize a Director or his firm to act as auditor to the
Company.
The Directors shall cause minutes to be made for the purpose of recording:
all appointments of officers made by the Directors;
the names of the Directors present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the
Directors; and
all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Company, and of the Directors and of
committees of Directors.
When the chairman of a meeting of the Directors signs the minutes of such meeting the same shall be
deemed to have been duly held notwithstanding that all the Directors have not actually come together
or that there may have been a technical defect in the proceedings.
A resolution in writing signed by all the Directors or all the members of a committee of Directors
entitled to receive notice of a meeting of Directors or committee of Directors, as the case may be (an
alternate Director, subject as provided otherwise in the terms of appointment of the alternate Director,
being entitled to sign such a resolution on behalf of his appointer), shall be as valid and effectual as if
it had been passed at a duly called and constituted meeting of Directors or committee of Directors, as
the case may be. When signed a resolution may consist of several documents each signed by one or
more of the Directors or his duly appointed alternate.
The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body but if and for so long as
their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these Articles as the necessary
quorum of Directors, the continuing Directors may act for the purpose of increasing the number, or of
summoning a general meeting of the Company, but for no other purpose.
Subject to any regulations imposed on it by the Directors, a committee appointed by the Directors may
elect a chairman of its meetings. If no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not
present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the committee members
present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

A committee appointed by the Directors may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Subject to any
regulations imposed on it by the Directors, questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a
majority of votes of the committee members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman
shall have a second or casting vote.
All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any Person acting
as a Director, shall notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the
appointment of any such Director or Person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were
disqualified, be as valid as if every such Person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a
Director.
PRESUMPTION OF ASSENT
A Director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which an action on any Company
matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his dissent shall be
entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent from such action with
the person acting as the chairman or secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall
forward such dissent by registered post to such person immediately after the adjournment of the
meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to a Director who voted in favor of such action.
DIVIDENDS
Subject to any rights and restrictions for the time being attached to any Shares, the Directors may from
time to time declare dividends (including interim dividends) and other distributions on Shares in issue
and authorize payment of the same out of the funds of the Company lawfully available therefor.
Subject to any rights and restrictions for the time being attached to any Shares, the Company by
Ordinary Resolution may declare dividends, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by
the Directors.
The Directors may, before recommending or declaring any dividend, set aside out of the funds legally
available for distribution such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, in the
absolute discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies or for equalizing
dividends or for any other purpose to which those funds may be properly applied, and pending such
application may in the absolute discretion of the Directors, either be employed in the business of the
Company or be invested in such investments (other than Shares of the Company) as the Directors may
from time to time think fit.
Any dividend payable in cash to the holder of Shares may be paid in any manner determined by the
Directors. If paid by cheque it will be sent by mail addressed to the holder at his address in the
Register, or addressed to such person and at such addresses as the holder may direct. Every such
cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders otherwise direct, be made payable to the
order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first on
the Register in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque
or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company.
The Directors may determine that a dividend shall be paid wholly or partly by the distribution of
specific assets (which may consist of the shares or securities of any other company) and may settle all
questions concerning such distribution. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Directors
may fix the value of such specific assets, may determine that cash payment shall be made to some
Shareholders in lieu of specific assets and may vest any such specific assets in trustees on such terms
as the Directors think fit.
Subject to any rights and restrictions for the time being attached to any Shares, all dividends shall be
declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the Shares, but if and for so long as nothing is
paid up on any of the Shares dividends may be declared and paid according to the par value of the
Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the
purposes of this Article as paid on the Share.

If several Persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effective receipts
for any dividend or other moneys payable on or in respect of the Share.
No dividend shall bear interest against the Company.
Any dividend unclaimed after a period of six calendar years from the date of declaration of such
dividend may be forfeited by the Board of Directors and, if so forfeited, shall revert to the Company.
ACCOUNTS, AUDIT AND ANNUAL RETURN AND DECLARATION
The books of account relating to the Company’s affairs shall be kept in such manner as may be
determined from time to time by the Directors.
The books of account shall be kept at the Registered Office, or at such other place or places as the
Directors think fit, and shall always be open to the inspection of the Directors.
The Directors may from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places
and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall
be open to the inspection of Shareholders not being Directors, and no Shareholder (not being a
Director) shall have any right to inspect any account or book or document of the Company except as
conferred by law or authorized by the Directors or by Ordinary Resolution.
The accounts relating to the Company’s affairs shall be audited in such manner and with such financial
year end as may be determined from time to time by the Directors or failing any determination as
aforesaid shall not be audited.
The Directors may appoint an auditor of the Company who shall hold office until removed from office
by a resolution of the Directors and may fix his or their remuneration.
Every auditor of the Company shall have a right of access at all times to the books and accounts and
vouchers of the Company and shall be entitled to require from the Directors and officers of the
Company such information and explanation as may be necessary for the performance of the duties of
the auditors.
The auditors shall, if so required by the Directors, make a report on the accounts of the Company
during their tenure of office at the next annual general meeting following their appointment, and at any
time during their term of office, upon request of the Directors or any general meeting of the Members.
The Directors in each calendar year shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, an annual return and
declaration setting forth the particulars required by the Companies Act and deliver a copy thereof to
the Registrar of Companies in the Cayman Islands.
CAPITALISATION OF RESERVES
Subject to the Companies Act, the Directors may:
resolve to capitalize an amount standing to the credit of reserves (including a Share Premium
Account, capital redemption reserve and profit and loss account), which is available for
distribution;
appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalized to the Shareholders in proportion to the nominal
amount of Shares (whether or not fully paid) held by them respectively and apply that sum on
their behalf in or towards:
paying up the amounts (if any) for the time being unpaid on Shares held by them
respectively, or
paying up in full unissued Shares or debentures of a nominal amount equal to that sum,

and allot the Shares or debentures, credited as fully paid, to the Shareholders (or as they may direct) in
those proportions, or partly in one way and partly in the other, but the Share Premium Account, the
capital redemption reserve and profits which are not available for distribution may, for the purposes of
this Article, only be applied in paying up unissued Shares to be allotted to Shareholders credited as
fully paid;
make any arrangements they think fit to resolve a difficulty arising in the distribution of a
capitalized reserve and in particular, without limitation, where Shares or debentures become
distributable in fractions the Directors may deal with the fractions as they think fit;
authorize a Person to enter (on behalf of all the Shareholders concerned) into an agreement with
the Company providing for either:
the allotment to the Shareholders respectively, credited as fully paid, of Shares or
debentures to which they may be entitled on the capitalization, or
the payment by the Company on behalf of the Shareholders (by the application of their
respective proportions of the reserves resolved to be capitalized) of the amounts or part of
the amounts remaining unpaid on their existing Shares,
and any such agreement made under this authority being effective and binding on all those
Shareholders; and
generally do all acts and things required to give effect to the resolution.
Notwithstanding any provisions in these Articles, the Directors may resolve to capitalize an amount
standing to the credit of reserves (including the share premium account, capital redemption reserve and
profit and loss account) or otherwise available for distribution by applying such sum in paying up in
full unissued Shares to be allotted and issued to:

companies upon exercise or vesting of any options or awards granted under any share incentive
scheme or employee benefit scheme or other arrangement which relates to such persons that has
been adopted or approved by the Directors or the Members;

under any share incentive scheme or employee benefit scheme or other arrangement which
relates to such persons that has been adopted or approved by the Directors or the Members.

premium paid on the issue of any Share.
There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the
difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided
always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company

Every Director (including for the purposes of this Article any alternate Director appointed pursuant to
the provisions of these Articles), Secretary, assistant Secretary, or other officer for the time being and

representatives of the same (each an “Indemnified Person”) shall be indemnified and secured harmless

NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS
No Person shall be recognized by the Company as holding any Share upon any trust and the Company
shall not, unless required by law, be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognize (even when
having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share or (except only
as otherwise provided by these Articles or as the Companies Act requires) any other right in respect of
any Share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in each Shareholder registered in the
Register.
WINDING UP
If the Company shall be wound up the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and
any other sanction required by the Companies Act, divide amongst the Members in specie or in kind
the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same
kind or not) and may for that purpose value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried
out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like
sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the
Members as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be
compelled to accept any asset upon which there is a liability.
If the Company shall be wound up, and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall
be insufficient to repay the whole of the share capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as
nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the par value of the
Shares held by them. If in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall
be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the share capital at the commencement of the winding up,
the surplus shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the par value of the Shares held
by them at the commencement of the winding up subject to a deduction from those Shares in respect of
which there are monies due, of all monies payable to the Company for unpaid calls or otherwise. This
Article is without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and
conditions.
AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
Subject to the Companies Act, the Company may at any time and from time to time by Special
Resolution alter or amend these Articles in whole or in part.
CLOSING OF REGISTER OR FIXING RECORD DATE
For the purpose of determining those Shareholders that are entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote
at any meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or those Shareholders that are entitled to
receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination as to who is a Shareholder for any
other purpose, the Directors may provide that the Register shall be closed for transfers for a stated
period which shall not exceed in any case thirty calendar days in any calendar year.
In lieu of or apart from closing the Register, the Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date
for any such determination of those Shareholders that are entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote
at a meeting of the Shareholders and for the purpose of determining those Shareholders that are
entitled to receive payment of any dividend the Directors may, at or within ninety calendar days prior
to the date of declaration of such dividend, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such
determination.
If the Register is not so closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of those Shareholders
entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at a meeting of Shareholders or those Shareholders that are
entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is posted or the date
on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall
be the record date for such determination of Shareholders. When a determination of those
Shareholders that are entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at a meeting of Shareholders has been
made as provided in this Article, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

incorporated, registered or existing. In furtherance of a resolution adopted pursuant to this Article, the
Directors may cause an application to be made to the Registrar of Companies to deregister the

provider of the Company) specifically authorized by the Directors, shall be entitled to disclose to any
regulatory or judicial authority any information regarding the affairs of the Company including without
limitation information contained in the Register and books of the Company.
EXCLUSIVE FORUM
Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent
permitted by relevant law, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum
for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act,
regardless of whether such legal suit, action, or proceeding also involves parties other than the
Company.
Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the courts of the
Cayman Islands shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear, settle and/or determine any dispute,
controversy or claim (including any non-contractual dispute, controversy or claim) whether arising out
of or in connection with these Articles or otherwise, including any questions regarding their existence,
validity, formation or termination. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the jurisdiction of

of the Law or these Articles including but not limited to any purchase or acquisition of Shares,
securities or guarantee provided in consideration thereof, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against
the Company which if brought in the United States would be a claim arising under the internal affairs
doctrine (as such concept is recognized under the laws of the United States from time to time). This
Article 165 shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created
by the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim based on
securities laws for which claim the federal district courts of the United States have exclusive
jurisdiction.
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any Share or other securities in the Company,
or purchasing or otherwise acquiring ADSs issued pursuant to relevant deposit agreements, whether
such acquisition be by transfer, sale, operation of law or otherwise, shall be deemed to have notice of,
irrevocably agreed and consented to the provisions of this Article and Articles 166 and 167 above.
Without prejudice to the foregoing, if any part of this Article, Article 166 and/or Article 167 are held to
be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the legality, validity or enforceability of the
rest of these Articles shall not be affected nor be impaired and this Article, Article 166 and/or Article
167 shall be interpreted and construed to the maximum extent possible to apply in the relevant
jurisdiction with whatever modification or deletion as may be necessary so as best to give effect to the
intention of the Company.

SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
3.1 Number of Shares.
(a) Subject to the provisions of Article 9 and Section 3.1(b), the maximum aggregate number of
Shares which may be issued pursuant to all Awards (including Incentive Share Options) shall initially be
21,893,567  ordinary shares of the Company (the “Share Limit”).
(b) To the extent that an Award terminates, expires, or lapses for any reason, any Shares subject to
the Award shall again be available for the grant of an Award pursuant to the Plan. To the extent
permitted by Applicable Laws, Shares issued in assumption of, or in substitution for, any outstanding
awards of any entity acquired in any form or combination by the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary
of the Company shall not be counted against Shares available for grant pursuant to the Plan. Shares
delivered by the Participant or withheld by the Company upon the exercise of any Award under the Plan,
in payment of the exercise price thereof or tax withholding thereon, may again be optioned, granted or
awarded hereunder, subject to the limitations of Section 3.1(a). If any Awards are forfeited by the
Participant or repurchased by the Company, the Shares underlying such Awards may again be optioned,
granted or awarded hereunder, subject to the limitations of Section 3.1(a). Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 3.1(b), no Shares may again be optioned, granted, or awarded if such action
would cause an Incentive Share Option to fail to qualify as an Incentive Share Option under Section 422
of the Code.
3.2 Shares Distributed. Any Shares distributed pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of
authorized and unissued Shares, treasury shares (subject to Applicable Laws) or Shares purchased on the
open market. Additionally, if applicable, in the discretion of the Committee, American Depository Shares in an
amount equal to the number of Shares which otherwise would be distributed pursuant to an Award may be
distributed in lieu of Shares in settlement of any Award. If the number of Shares represented by an American
Depository Share is other than on a one-to-one basis, the Share Limit of Section 3.1 shall be adjusted to
reflect the distribution of American Depository Shares in lieu of Shares.
ARTICLE 4 
ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION
4.1 Eligibility. Persons eligible to participate in this Plan include Persons recognized by the Committee,
e.g., Directors, Employees and Consultants, as determined by the Committee.
4.2 Participation. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, select from
among all eligible individuals, those to whom Awards shall be granted and determine the nature and amount
of each Award. No individual shall have any right to be granted an Award pursuant to this Plan, unless
otherwise determined by the Committee in accordance with the Plan.
4.3 Jurisdictions. In order to assure the viability of Awards granted to Participants employed in various
jurisdictions, the Committee may provide for such special terms as it may consider necessary or appropriate
to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy, or custom applicable in the jurisdiction in which the
Participant resides or is employed. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to, or
amendments, restatements, or alternative versions of, the Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate
for such purposes without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose;
provided, however, that no such supplements, amendments, restatements, or alternative versions shall
increase the Share Limit contained in Section 3.1 of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee
may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate any Applicable
Laws.

OPTIONS
5.1 General. The Committee is authorized to grant Options to Participants on the following terms and
conditions:
(a) Exercise Price. The exercise price per Share subject to an Option shall be determined by the
Committee and set forth in the Notice of Grant which may be a fixed or variable price related to the Fair
Market Value of the Shares. The exercise price per Share subject to an Option may be amended or
adjusted in the absolute discretion of the Committee, the determination of which shall be final, binding,
and conclusive. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Laws or any
exchange rule, a downward adjustment of the exercise prices of Options mentioned in the preceding
sentence may be effective without the approval of the Company’s shareholders or the approval of the
affected Participants.
(b) Time and Conditions of Exercise. The Committee may determine the time or times at which an
Option may be exercised in whole or in part, including exercise prior to vesting; provided that the term
of any Option granted under the Plan shall not exceed ten years, except as provided in Section 12.1. The
Committee may also determine any conditions, if any, that must be satisfied before all or part of an
Option may be exercised.
(c) Payment. The Committee may determine the methods by which the exercise price of an Option
may be paid, the form of payment, including, without limitation (i) cash or check denominated in U.S.
Dollars, (ii) to the extent permissible under the Applicable Laws, cash or check in Chinese Renminbi, (iii)
cash or check denominated in any other local currency as approved by the Committee, (iv) Shares held
for such period of time as may be required by the Committee in order to avoid adverse financial
accounting consequences and having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate
exercise price of the Option or exercised portion thereof, (v) after the Trading Date the delivery of a
notice that the Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to Shares then
issuable upon exercise of the Option, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of
the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of the Option exercise price; provided that
payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company upon settlement of such sale, (vi) other
property acceptable to the Committee with a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price, or (vii) any
combination of the foregoing. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no
Participant who is a member of the Board or an “executive officer” of the Company within the meaning
of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to pay the exercise price of an Option in any

beneficiaries or beneficial owners are the Participant and/or the Participant’s family members, or to
such other Persons as may be expressly approved by the Committee, pursuant to such conditions
and procedures as the Committee or may establish. Any permitted transfer shall be subject to the
condition that the Committee receives evidence satisfactory to it that the transfer is being made for
estate and/or tax planning purposes and on a basis consistent with the Company’s lawful issue of
securities.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 8.2.2 to the contrary, but subject to compliance
with all Applicable Laws, Incentive Share Options, Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units

Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Participant and to receive any distribution
with respect to any Award upon the Participant’s death. A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or
other Person claiming any rights pursuant to the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and
any Notice of Grant applicable to the Participant, except to the extent the Plan and Notice of Grant otherwise
provide, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. If the
Participant is married and resides in a community property state, a designation of a Person other than the
Participant’s spouse as his or her beneficiary with respect to more than 50% of the Participant’s interest in
the Award shall not be effective without the prior written consent of the Participant’s spouse. If no
beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, payment shall be made to the Person entitled
thereto pursuant to the Participant’s will or the laws of descent and distribution. Subject to the foregoing, a
beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Participant at any time provided the change or
revocation is filed with the Committee.
8.4 Share Certificates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be
required to issue or deliver any certificates evidencing the Shares pursuant to the exercise of any Award,
unless and until the Committee has determined, with advice of counsel, that the issuance and delivery of
such certificates is in compliance with all Applicable Laws, regulations of governmental authorities and, if
applicable, the requirements of any exchange on which the Shares are listed or traded. All Share certificates
delivered pursuant to the Plan are subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee
deems necessary or advisable to comply with all Applicable Laws, and the rules of any national securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted, or traded. The Committee
may place legends on any Share certificate to reference restrictions applicable to the Shares. In addition to
the terms and conditions provided herein, the Committee may require that a Participant make such reasonable
covenants, agreements, and representations as the Committee, in its discretion, deems advisable in order to
comply with any such laws, regulations, or requirements. The Committee shall have the right to require any
Participant to comply with any timing or other restrictions with respect to the settlement or exercise of any
Award, including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the discretion of the Committee.
8.5 Paperless Administration. Subject to Applicable Laws, the Committee may make Awards, provide
applicable disclosure and procedures for exercise of Awards by an internet website or interactive voice
response system for the paperless administration of Awards.
8.6 Payment Method. In the event the exercise price for an Award is paid in a currency other than U.S.
dollars or any other form of payment as permitted in the Notice of Grant, the amount payable will be
determined by conversion from U.S. dollars at the exchange rates set forth in the Notice of Grant or as
selected by the Committee on the date of exercise. A Participant (or his or her legal representative or
beneficiary, in the case of the Participant’s Disability or death, respectively), may be required to provide
evidence that any currency used to pay the exercise price of any Award was acquired and taken out of the

amalgamation, arrangement or consolidation, spin-off, recapitalization or other distribution (other than
normal cash dividends) of Company assets to its shareholders, or any other change affecting the shares of
Shares or the share price of a Share, the Committee may, make such proportionate and equitable adjustments,
if any, as the Committee in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such change with respect to (a) the

9.2 Corporate Transactions. Except as may otherwise be provided in any Notice of Grant or any other
written agreement entered into by and between the Company and a Participant, if the Committee anticipates
the occurrence, or upon the occurrence, of a Corporate Transaction, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, provide for (i) any and all Awards outstanding hereunder to terminate at a specific time in the
future and shall give each Participant the right to exercise the vested portion of such Awards during a period
of time as the Committee may determine, or (ii) the purchase of any Award for an amount of cash, as
determined by the Committee in good faith, which may equal to the amount that could have been attained
upon the exercise of such Award (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of such date the Committee
determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award, then
such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment), or (iii) the replacement of such Award
with other rights or property selected by the Committee in its sole discretion or the assumption of or
substitution of such Award by the successor or surviving corporation, or a Parent or Subsidiary thereof,
with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of Shares and prices, which will preserve the rights
under the affected Awards previously granted hereunder, or (iv) payment of Award in cash based on the

9.3 Outstanding Awards - Other Changes. In the event of any other change in the capitalization of the
Company or corporate change other than those specifically referred to in this Article 9, the Committee may, in
its absolute discretion, make such adjustments in the number and class of shares subject to Awards issued
and outstanding on the date on which such change occurs and in the per share grant or exercise price of
each Award as the Committee may consider appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.
9.4 No Other Rights. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no Participant shall have any rights by
reason of any subdivision or consolidation of Shares of any class, the payment of any dividend, any
increase or decrease in the number of shares of any class or any dissolution, liquidation, merger, or
consolidation of the Company or any other corporation. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or pursuant
to action of the Committee under the Plan, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities

respect to, the number of shares subject to an Award or the grant or exercise price of any Award.

to time, the Committee may, terminate, amend, modify, alter, suspend or discontinue the Plan or any portion

termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award
previously granted pursuant to the Plan without the prior written consent of the Participant, except to the

regulations.
ARTICLE 13 
GENERAL PROVISIONS
13.1 No Rights to Awards. No Participant, Employee, Director, Consultant or other Person shall have any
claim to be granted any Award pursuant to the Plan, and neither the Company nor the Committee is obligated
to treat Participants, Employees, Directors, Consultants and other Persons uniformly. The terms
C-12 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and conditions of Awards and the Committee’s determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need
not be the same with respect to each Participant (whether or not such Participant is similarly situated).
13.2 No Shareholders Rights. No Award gives the Participant any of the rights of a Shareholder of the
Company unless and until Shares are in fact issued to such Person in connection with such Award.
13.3 Taxes. No Shares shall be delivered under the Plan to any Participant until such Participant has
made arrangements acceptable to the Committee for the satisfaction of any income and employment tax
withholding obligations under Applicable Laws. The Company or any Subsidiary shall have the authority
and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to
satisfy all applicable taxes (including the Participant’s payroll tax obligations) required or permitted by
Applicable Laws to be withheld with respect to any taxable event concerning a Participant arising as a result
of this Plan. The Committee may in its discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement allow a
Participant to elect to have the Company withhold Shares otherwise issuable under an Award (or allow the
return of Shares) having a Fair Market Value equal to the sums required to be withheld. Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Plan, the number of Shares which may be withheld with respect to the issuance,
vesting, exercise or payment of any Award (or which may be repurchased from the Participant of such Award
after such Shares were acquired by the Participant from the Company) in order to satisfy any income and
payroll tax liabilities applicable to the Participant with respect to the issuance, vesting, exercise or payment
of the Award shall, unless specifically approved by the Committee, be limited to the number of Shares which
have a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or repurchase equal to the aggregate amount of such
liabilities based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for the applicable income and payroll tax
purposes that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income.
13.4 No Right to Employment or Services. Nothing in the Plan or any Notice of Grant shall interfere with or
limit in any way the right of the Service Recipient to terminate any Participant’s employment or services at
any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employment or services of any Service
Recipient.
13.5 Unfunded Status of Awards. The Plan is intended to be an “unfunded” plan for incentive
compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing
contained in the Plan or any Notice of Grant shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those
of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary.
13.6 Indemnification. To the extent allowable pursuant to Applicable Laws, each member of the
Committee or of the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost,
liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by them in connection with or
resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she
may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and
all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or
her; provided he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the
same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of
indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such Persons may be
entitled pursuant to the Company’s Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association, as a matter of
law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
13.7 Relationship to other Benefits. No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in
determining any benefits pursuant to any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance,
welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except to the extent otherwise expressly
provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.
13.8 Expenses. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its
Subsidiaries.
13.9 Titles and Headings. The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of
reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall
control.
C-13 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
13.10 Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued and the Committee may determine, in its
discretion, whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares shall be
eliminated by rounding up or down as appropriate.
13.11 Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the
Plan, and any Award granted or awarded to any Participant who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act, shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16
of the Exchange Act (including any amendment to Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act) that are requirements for
the application of such exemptive rule. To the extent permitted by the Applicable Laws, the Plan and Awards
granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such
applicable exemptive rule.
13.12 Government and Other Regulations. The obligation of the Company to make payment of awards in
Shares or otherwise shall be subject to all Applicable Laws, and to such approvals by government agencies
as may be required. The Company shall be under no obligation to register any of the Shares paid pursuant to
the Plan under the Securities Act or any other similar law in any applicable jurisdiction. If the Shares paid
pursuant to the Plan may in certain circumstances be exempt from registration pursuant to the Securities Act
or other Applicable Laws, the Company may restrict the transfer of such Shares in such manner as it deems
advisable to ensure the availability of any such exemption.
13.13 Governing Law. The Plan and all Notice of Grant shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.
13.14 Section 409A. To the extent that the Committee determines that any Award granted under the Plan
is or may become subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Notice of Grant evidencing such Award shall
incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section 409A of the Code. To the extent applicable, the
Plan and the Notice of Grant shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and the U.S.
Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretative guidance issued thereunder, including without
limitation any such regulation or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding
any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date the Committee
determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury
guidance (including such Department of Treasury guidance as may be issued after the Effective Date), the
Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Notice of Grant or adopt other
policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any
other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Award from
Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to
the Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related U.S. Department of
Treasury guidance.
13.15 Appendices. The Committee may approve such supplements, amendments, or appendices to the
Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for purposes of compliance with Applicable Laws or
otherwise and such supplements, amendments or appendices shall be considered a part of the Plan;
provided, however, that no such supplements shall increase the Share Limit contained in Section 3.1 of the
Plan without the approval of the Board.

RE: Fairness Opinion - Bitdeer Technologies Group
Dear Madames/Sirs:
IJW & Co., Ltd. (“IJW”) understands that Bitdeer Technologies Group (the “Group” or the “Vendor”)
intends to sell its business, Bitdeer Technologies Group  (the “Business”) to Blue Safari Group Acquisition
Corp. (the “Company”) as part of a “de-SPAC” transaction. In return, the Company will make a payment (in
equity) to the Vendor at an implied valuation of $1,180,000,000 (the “Transaction”).
The Company has engaged IJW to evaluate the consideration to be paid under the Transaction (the
“Consideration”) to review and assess whether it is fair from a financial point of view, pursuant to the terms
of the Transaction, to the shareholders of the Company (the “Shareholders”) and to prepare and deliver an
independent, objective Fairness Opinion (the “Opinion”) in this regard. The Opinion shall be applicable as at
a date to be mutually agreed upon between the Company and IJW (the “Valuation Date”). The Transaction
will be completed by way of a merger between the Vendor and the Company; the estimated value of the
Consideration to be paid is to be approximately $1,180,000,000.
For the purposes of the Opinion, all dollar amounts referred to herein are denominated in United States
dollars, unless stated otherwise. IJW will receive a fee for our services, based strictly on professional time
incurred, pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagement letter dated February 25, 2023 (the “Engagement

the use of the Opinion presented. The calculations, analyses, and conclusions developed and the Opinion

Appraisal Foundation (U.S.), International Valuation Standards of the International Valuation Standards
Council and applicable securities laws.
IJW, as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, financial
restructurings and other financial services. We have been engaged by the Company pursuant to the
Engagement Letter to render our Opinion as investment bankers to the Company in connection with the
Transaction. The Company has agreed to indemnify IJW against certain liabilities that may arise out of or in
connection with the services rendered and to be rendered by IJW under such Engagement Letter.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp.
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in shareholders’ deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from
February 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as
the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 23, 2021 (inception)
through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.
Explanatory Paragraph - Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has a
significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant costs and needs to raise additional funds to
meet its obligations and sustain its operations and the Company’s business plan is dependent on the
completion of a business combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are
required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1 - Organization and Business Operation
Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated as a
British Virgin Island (“BVI”) business company on February 23, 2021. The Company was incorporated for the
purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company has not
selected any potential Business Combination target and the Company has not, nor has anyone on its behalf,
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential Business Combination target.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period
from February 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation, the Initial
Public Offering (the “IPO”), searching for a Business Combination target and the negotiation of the Merger
Agreement as described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the
completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO.
The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.
The Company’s Sponsor is BSG First Euro Investment Corp., a British Virgin Islands company (the
“Sponsor”).
The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on June 9, 2021 (the “Effective
Date”). On June 14, 2021 the Company consummated the IPO of 5,750,000 units (the “Units”), including
750,000 Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units to
cover the over-allotment (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units
being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000, which is
discussed in Note 3.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 292,500 units,
including 22,500 units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
units to cover the over-allotment (the “Private Placement Unit”), at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement
Unit, generating gross proceeds of $2,925,000, which is discussed in Note 4.
Transaction costs of the IPO amounted to $4,158,799 consisting of $1,150,000 of underwriting discount,
$2,012,500 of deferred underwriting discount, the fair value of the representative shares of $478,857 and
$517,442 of other offering costs.
Upon the closing of the IPO, an aggregate of $10.10 per Unit sold in the IPO, or an aggregate of
$58,075,000, was held in a Trust Account (“Trust Account”) and was invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be
released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any, the proceeds from the Proposed Public Offering and the
private placement will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the
initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to
(A) modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if the
Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity and (iii)
the redemption of all of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business
Combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust
Account could become subject to the claims of the creditors, if any, which could have priority over the
claims of the public shareholders.
The Company will provide the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of
their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a
shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The
decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or
conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of
factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the
Company to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. The Company

Note 1 - Organization and Business Operation
Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated as a
British Virgin Island (“BVI”) business company on February 23, 2021. The Company was incorporated for the
purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company has not
selected any potential Business Combination target and the Company has not, nor has anyone on its behalf,
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential Business Combination target.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period
from February 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation, the Initial
Public Offering (the “IPO”), searching for a Business Combination target and the negotiation of the Merger
Agreement as described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the
completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO.
The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.
The Company’s Sponsor is BSG First Euro Investment Corp., a British Virgin Islands company (the
“Sponsor”).
The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on June 9, 2021 (the “Effective
Date”). On June 14, 2021 the Company consummated the IPO of 5,750,000 units (the “Units”), including
750,000 Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units to
cover the over-allotment (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units
being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000, which is
discussed in Note 3.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 292,500 units,
including 22,500 units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
units to cover the over-allotment (the “Private Placement Unit”), at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement
Unit, generating gross proceeds of $2,925,000, which is discussed in Note 4.
Transaction costs of the IPO amounted to $4,158,799 consisting of $1,150,000 of underwriting discount,
$2,012,500 of deferred underwriting discount, the fair value of the representative shares of $478,857 and
$517,442 of other offering costs.
Upon the closing of the IPO, an aggregate of $10.10 per Unit sold in the IPO, or an aggregate of
$58,075,000, was held in a Trust Account (“Trust Account”) and was invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be
released to the Company to pay its taxes, if any, the proceeds from the Proposed Public Offering and the
private placement will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the
initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
shareholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to
(A) modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if the
Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity and (iii)
the redemption of all of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business
Combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust
Account could become subject to the claims of the creditors, if any, which could have priority over the
claims of the public shareholders.
The Company will provide the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of
their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a
shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The
decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or
conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of
factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the
Company to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. The Company

will provide the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares
upon the completion of the initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the
aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation
of the initial Business Combination, including interest, which interest shall be net of taxes payable, divided
by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.
The ordinary shares subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as
temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity.” In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net
tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the
Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in
favor of the Business Combination.
On December 5, 2022, the Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting. At this meeting, the
shareholders of the Company approved the proposal to amend and restate (the “Charter Amendment”) the
Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Charter”) to, among other
things, extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination (the “Extension”)
up to four (4) times for an additional three months each time from December 14, 2022 (the “Current
Termination Date”) to December 14, 2023 (the termination date as so extended, the “Extended Termination
Date”) by deleting the Charter in its entirety and substitute it with the second amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (the “Amended Charter”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Charter, the Company has until 18 months from the closing of the
IPO to consummate a Business Combination, provided however that if the board of directors anticipates that
the Company may not be able to consummate a Business Combination within 18 months of the closing of the
IPO, the Company may, by resolution of directors, at the request of the initial shareholders, extend the period
of time to consummate a Business Combination up to four times, each by an additional three months (for a
total of up to 30 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the initial shareholders depositing
additional funds into the Trust Account in accordance with terms as set out in the Trust Agreement
(“Combination Period”). In the event that the Company does not consummate a Business Combination
within 18 months from the closing of the IPO or within up to 30 months from the closing of the IPO (subject
in the latter case to valid three months extensions having been made in each case), such failure shall trigger
an automatic redemption of the Public Shares (an Automatic Redemption Event) and the Directors of the
Company shall take all such action necessary (i) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten
(10) Business Days thereafter to redeem the Public Shares in cash at a per-share amount equal to the
applicable Per-Share Redemption Price; and (ii) as promptly as practicable, to cease all operations except for
the purpose of making such distribution and any subsequent winding up of the Company’s affairs. In the
event of an Automatic Redemption Event, only the holders of Public Shares shall be entitled to receive pro
rata redeeming distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Public Shares. In order to extend
the time available for the Company to consummate the initial business combination, the Company must
deposit $0.15 for each public Class A ordinary share that has not been redeemed into the trust account for
each three-month extension.
In connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment, the holders of 4,031,612 Class A
ordinary shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption
price of approximately $10.41505502 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $41.99
million.
On June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, the Company deposited
into the Company’s trust account $1,150,000 (representing $0.10 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the
Combination Period from June 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, the Company made a
deposit of $257,758.20 to the trust account and extended the date by which the Company has to complete a
business combination from December 14, 2022 to March 14, 2023.
The Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to
their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination
and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder
F-8 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period
(although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public
shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination
Period). If the Company submits the initial Business Combination to the public shareholders for a vote, the
insiders have agreed, pursuant to such letter agreement, to vote their founder shares, private placement
shares and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of the initial Business Combination.
The Company’s Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims
by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with
which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the
Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust
account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust
assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a
third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to
any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be
unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such
third -party claims. The Company has not independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to
satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company.
The Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such obligations.
Merger
On November 18, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) by and among the Company, Blue Safari Mini Corp., an exempted company incorporated with
limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
(“Merger Sub”), and Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company, an exempted company incorporated with
limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Bitdeer”).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a Business Combination
transaction by which Merger Sub will merge with and into Bitdeer with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger” and, together with the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). The Merger Agreement and the
Transactions were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company, Merger Sub
and Bitdeer.
On December 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among (i) the Company, (ii) Bitdeer
Technologies Group, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman
Islands (“BTG”), (iii) Blue Safari Merge Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 1”), (iv) Blue Safari Merge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands
business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 2”), (v) Bitdeer Merge Limited, an
exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 3”, and together with BTG, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, the
“Acquisition Entities”), (vi) Merger Sub, and (vii) Bitdeer, to amend and restate the Original Merger
Agreement.
The Merger Agreement amended and restated the Original Merger Agreement to effect a change in
structure of the business combination without affecting any underlying economic interests, whereby (a)
Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the “First
SPAC Merger”) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of BTG, (b) immediately following the First SPAC
Merger, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity
(the “Second SPAC Merger”, and together with the First SPAC Merger, the “Initial Mergers”), and (c)
following the Initial Mergers, Merger Sub 3 will merge with and into Bitdeer (the “Acquisition Merger” and
together with the Initial Mergers, the “Mergers”), with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming a
wholly owned subsidiary of BTG. The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein were
unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company, BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub
2, Merger Sub 3, and Bitdeer.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are expected to be
consummated after obtaining the required approval by the shareholders of the Company, BTG, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub and Bitdeer and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing
conditions.
On May 30, 2022, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Amendment”, and the Original Merger Agreement as amended by such
Amendment, the “Amended Merger Agreement”) with BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3,
Merger Sub and Bitdeer, to amend the Original Merger Agreement. The Amendment extends the termination
date upon which either the Company or Bitdeer may terminate the Amended Merger Agreement, from May
31, 2022 to September 1, 2022.
In addition, pursuant to the Amendment, Bitdeer will provide certain interest-free loans with an
aggregate principal amount of US$1,993,000 to the Company to fund any amount that may be required in
order to extend the period of time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination and for
the Company’s working capital. Such loans will only become repayable upon the Closing of the Business
Combination.
On December 2, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Second Amendment”, and the First Amended Merger Agreement as
amended by such Second Amendment, the “Second Amended Merger Agreement”) with BTG, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub and Bitdeer, to amend the First Amended Merger Agreement. The
Second Amendment extends the termination date upon which either the Company or Bitdeer may terminate
the Second Amended Merger Agreement, from September 1, 2022 to the earlier of (i) June 1, 2023 and (ii) the
then applicable deadline for the Company to complete a Business Combination in accordance with its
organizational documents. In addition, pursuant to the Second Amendment, Bitdeer has agreed to provide
certain interest-free loans with an aggregate principal amount of $2,584,141 to the Company to fund any
amount that may be required in order to further extend the period of time available for the Company to
consummate a Business Combination and for its working capital. Such loans will only become repayable
upon the Acquisition Closing (as defined in the Second Amended Merger Agreement). As of December 31,
2022, the Company received $2,545,800 from Bitdeer.
Going Concern Consideration
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $487,303 in cash, and working capital deficit of $6,602,257.
The Company’s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the IPO were satisfied through the
proceeds of $25,000 from the sale of the Founders Shares (as defined in Note 5), and loan proceeds from the
Sponsor of $200,000 under the Note (Note 5).
Subsequent from the consummation of the IPO, the Company’s liquidity has been satisfied through the
net proceeds from the consummation of the IPO, the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account
and the loan from Bitdeer.
The Company expects to incur increased expenses since becoming a public company (for legal, financial
reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses in connection with the initial Business
Combination.
On June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, the Company deposited
into the Company’s trust account $1,150,000 (representing $0.20 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the
Combination Period from June 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, the Company made a
deposit of $257,758.20 (representing $0.15 per Class A ordinary share) to the trust account and extended the
date by which the Company has to complete a business combination from December 14, 2022 to March 14,
2023. It is uncertain that the Company will be able consummate a Business Combination by this date. If a
Business Combination is not consummated by the required date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and
subsequent dissolution. In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern”, management has determined that mandatory liquidation, and subsequent dissolution,
F-10 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
should the Company be unable to complete a business combination, raises substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this
date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. No adjustments have been made to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after March 14,
2023.
Based upon the above analysis, management determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated
financial statements are issued.
Risks and Uncertainties
Management is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while
it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position,
results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as
of the date of these consolidated financial statements. In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus
commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations,
including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus.
Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy are not determinable as of the
date of these consolidated financial statements and the specific impact on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these consolidated
financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of these uncertainties.
Additionally, as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation
and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Company’s ability to consummate
a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately
consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Company’s
ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing
which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased
market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The
impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet
determinable. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the SEC.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Emerging Growth Company
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as
modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of
certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements
F-11 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden
parachute payments not previously approved.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to
comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have
not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities
registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and
comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out
is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that
when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies,
the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private
companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s consolidated
financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an
emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or
impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported
amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less
when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company has $487,303 and $413,417 in cash and cash
equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Offering Costs Associated with IPO
The Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) Topic 5A - “Expenses of Offering”. Offering costs consist principally of professional and
registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO and were charged to
shareholders’ equity upon the completion of the IPO. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, offering costs in
the aggregate of $4,158,799 have been charged to shareholders’ equity (consisting of $1,150,000 of
underwriting discount, $2,012,500 of deferred underwriting discount, the fair value of the representative
shares of $478,857 and $517,442 of other offering costs).
Fair Value Measurements
The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under
FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented
in the balance sheet, primarily due to its short-term nature.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a
liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP stablishes a
three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in
active markets;
Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or
indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices
for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
F-12 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an
entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in
which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. In some
circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of
the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in
the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
Investments Held in Trust Account
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $18,237,834 and $58,077,104 assets held in the Trust
Account, which primarily consist of investments in mutual funds that invest in U.S. government securities,
cash, or a combination thereof. The Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as
trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each
reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in
gain on Investments Held in Trust Account in the accompanying statement of operations. The estimated fair
values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information and
classifies as Level 1 measurements.
Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption
The Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance
with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity.” Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is
measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that features
redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the
occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At
all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary
shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and
subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 1,718,388
and 5,750,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption
value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheets.
Net loss Per Ordinary Share
The Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B
ordinary shares. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. The table below
presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net loss per
share for each class of ordinary shares:

existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are
established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the consolidated
financial statements recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination by taxing authorities. The Company’s management determined that the British Virgin Islands is
the Company’s major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no
unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not
aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation
from its position. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.
The Company is considered to be a British Virgin Islands business company with no connection to any
other taxable jurisdiction and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the
British Virgin Islands or the United States. As such, the Company’s tax provision was zero for the period
presented.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a
cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage
of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the
Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting
pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.
Note 3 - Initial Public Offering
On June 14, 2021, Company consummated its IPO and sold 5,750,000 Units, including 750,000 Units sold
pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units to cover the over-
allotment. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”) and one right (“Right”) to receive
one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were
sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds to the Company of $57,500,000.
All of the 5,750,000 Class A ordinary share sold as part of the Units in the IPO contain a redemption
feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation,
if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection
with certain amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its
staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption
provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be
classified outside of permanent equity.
The Class A ordinary share is subject to SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments,
which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become
redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period
from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become
redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the
redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the
redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value
immediately as they occur. Immediately upon the closing of the IPO, the Company recognized the accretion
F-14 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable ordinary
shares resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.
On December 5, 2022, in connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment, the holders of
4,031,612 Class A ordinary shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for
cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.41505502 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of
approximately $41.99 million.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemptions
reflected on the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:

Note 4 - Private Placement
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO and the sale of the Units, the Company consummated the
private placement (“Private Placement”) of an aggregate 292,500 Units (“Private Placement Units”), which
included the additional 22,500 Private Placement Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’
option to cover the over-allotment.
The Private Placement Units and their component securities will not be transferable, assignable or
salable until 30 days after the consummation of the initial Business Combination except to permitted
transferees, and they will be non-redeemable and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by
the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.
Note 5 - Related Party Transactions
Founder Shares
On February 23, 2021 and March 4, 2021, the Company’s Sponsor paid $25,001 in total, or approximately
$0.017 per share, to cover certain of the offering and formation costs in exchange for an aggregate of
1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares (“Founder shares’), with no par value per share, 187,500 shares of which
were subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was
exercised. On June 14, 2021, the underwriter exercised the over-allotment option in full, hence, the 187,500
Founder Shares that are no longer subject to forfeiture.
The Company’s initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its founder shares
until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (B) the
date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar
transaction after the initial Business Combination that results in all of the public shareholders having the
right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property (the “Lock-up”).

Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $200,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest
bearing and payable on the date that the Company consummates the IPO of its securities or the date on
which the Company determines not to conduct an IPO, however, the date was extended to August 31, 2022,
provided that the Company may in its sole discretion, and upon written notice to First Euro, extend such
maturity date for an additional six months in the event that the Company has not repaid in full the principal
amount and accrued interest by August 31, 2022 pursuant to the amended Promissory Note issued on May
30, 2022. On August 31, 2022, the Company issued an extension notice the Sponsor, to extend the maturity
date of the Promissory Note for an additional six (6) months from August 31, 2022 to February 28, 2023. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had borrowed $200,000 under the promissory note.
Due to Related Party
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balance is $420,190 and $355,863, respectively. The balance of
$420,190 represented of $130,000 administrative support services fee provided by the Sponsor commencing

commencing on June 9, 2021, and $288,530 of accrued expenses paid by the Sponsor on behalf of the
Company.
Working Capital Loans
In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the
Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not
obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). If the Company
completes the initial Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans. In the
event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from the Trust
Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to $1,150,000 of the Working Capital Loans
may be convertible into units of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per Unit at the
option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. As of December 31, 2022
and 2021, no such Working Capital Loans were outstanding.
Note 6 - Promissory Note - Bitdeer
On May 30, 2022, the First Amendment to the Amended & Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger by
and among the Company, Bitdeer and other parties was issued, and pursuant it, Bitdeer has agreed to loan
the Company an aggregate principal amount of $1.99 million in two tranches to fund any and all amounts
required to extend the period of time the Company has to complete a Business Combination for up to two (2)
times for an additional three (3) months period each time. Pursuant to the Second Amendment entered into
on December 2, 2022, Bitdeer has agreed to provide certain interest-free loans with an aggregate principal
amount of $2,584,141 to the Company to fund any amount that may be required in order to further extend the
period of time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination and for its working capital.
The loans bear no interest and is only repayable only at the closing of a Business Combination by the
Company. If the Closing of the Business Combination does not occur, the Company will not repay such
loans. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had borrowed $2,545,800 under the promissory note.
Note 7 - Commitments & Contingencies
Registration Rights
The holders of the founder shares, Private Placement Units, shares being issued to the underwriters of
the Proposed Public Offering, and units that may be issued on conversion of Working Capital Loans (and in
each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant
to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the Proposed Public
Offering requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the founder shares, only
after
F-16 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
conversion to the Class A ordinary shares). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three
demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company registers such securities. In addition, the holders
have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the
completion of the initial Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such
securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.
Underwriting Agreement
The underwriters had a 45-day option from June 14, 2021 to purchase up to an additional 750,000 Units,
consisting of 750,000 Class A ordinary shares and 750,000 rights to cover over-allotments, if any.
On June 14, 2021, the underwriter fully exercised the over-allotment option to purchase 750,000 Units,
and the Company paid an underwriting commission in aggregate of $1,150,000. Additionally, the underwriters
will be entitled to a deferred underwriting commissions of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the IPO held in the
Trust Account, or $2,012,500 upon the completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination subject to
the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Representative’s Ordinary Shares
The Company issued to Maxim Partners LLC and/or its designees, 57,500 shares upon the
consummation of the IPO. Maxim has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until the
completion of our initial business combination. In addition, Maxim has agreed (i) to waive its redemption
rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and
(ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such shares if the
Company fails to complete the Business Combination within the Combination Period.
The shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a
period of 180 days immediately following the date of the commencement of sales in the IPO pursuant to
FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1), these securities will not be the subject of any
hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the
securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration
statement of which the prospectus forms a part, nor may they be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or
hypothecated for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statement
of which the prospectus forms a part except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the
offering and their officers, partners, registered persons or affiliates.
Right of First Refusal
For a period beginning on the closing of the IPO and ending 12 months from the closing of a business
combination, the Company has granted Maxim a right of first refusal to act as lead-left book running manager
and lead left placement agent for any and all future private or public equity, equity-linked, convertible and
debt offerings during such period. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(6)(A), such right of first refusal
shall not have a duration of more than three years from the commencement of sales in the IPO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Rights - Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a business combination,
each holder of a right will automatically receive one-tenth (1/10) of one Class A ordinary share upon
consummation of the initial Business Combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in
connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole
share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of British Virgin Islands law. As a
result, you must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of your rights upon closing of
a Business Combination. In the event the Company will not be the surviving company upon completion of
the initial Business Combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its
rights in order to receive the one-tenth (1/10) of one Class A ordinary share underlying each right upon
consummation of the Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business
Combination within the required time period and the Company redeems the public shares for the funds held
in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds for their rights and the rights will
expire worthless.
Note 9 - Subsequent Events
The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date
up to the date that the consolidated financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than as
described below, the Company did not identify any other subsequent events that would have required
adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.
On March 2, 2023, the Company received $667,800 loan from Bitdeer pursuant to the Second Amended
Merger Agreement. As of March 2, 2023, the Company had borrowed $3,213,600 from Bitdeer.
Note 10 - Additional Subsequent Events (Unaudited)
On March 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Third Amendment”, and the Second Amended Merger Agreement as amended by
such Third Amendment, the “Third Amended Merger Agreement”) with BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2,
Merger Sub 3, SPAC Sub and Bitdeer, to amend the Second Amended Merger Agreement. The Third
Amendment revises the definition of “Per Share Equity Value” to the quotient obtained by dividing (i)
US$1,180,000,000 by (ii) the Company Total Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the
Third Amendment, the parties thereto also agreed to remove the American Depository Share structure
previously contemplated under the Second Amended Merger Agreement and instead issue ordinary shares
of BTG as considerations to be paid pursuant to the Third Amended Merger Agreement.
The Company has made a deposit of $257,758.20 to the Trust Account and extended the date by which
the Company has to complete a business combination from March 14, 2023 to June 14, 2023. Following such
deposit, the amount of funds remaining in the Trust Account is approximately $18.6 million.

under IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment. As the sale of mining machines represents contracts with
customers in the Group’s ordinary course of business, the transactions should have been accounted for
under IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue from the sale of mining machines should
have been recognized at the amount of promised consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled,
and the cost of revenue should have been recognized at the net book value of the mining machines sold, as
discussed in detail in the Note 2(p) to the Annual Financial Statements. The previously reported condensed
combined and consolidated financial statement for the six months ended June 30, 2021 is restated to correct
the above error.
The effects of the above adjustment on the condensed combined and consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income and cash flows, for the six months ended June 30, 2021, are presented
below. These adjustments did not have any impact on the net income or the condensed combined and

These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings and financial position.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in the Interim Financial Information are the
same as those applied in the Annual Financial Statements.
New and amendments to the standards that effective for the financial year ending December 31, 2022 do
not have a material impact on the Group’s Interim Financial Information.
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for
the reporting periods presented and have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards are not
expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable
future transactions.
a. Changes in accounting policies and newly adopted accounting policies
The Group has applied the following amendments to IFRSs issued by the IASB to this interim financial
report for the current accounting period:

None of these amendments have had a material effect on how the Group’s results and financial position
for the current or prior periods have been prepared or presented in this interim financial report. The Group
has not applied any new standard or interpretation that is not yet effective for the current accounting period.
4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
In preparing the Interim Financial Information, management has made judgements and estimates that
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, profit and
loss. Estimates and judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates
may not be equal to the related actual results. The significant judgement made by management in applying
the Group’s accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those described
in the Annual Financial Statements.
5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial risk factors
The Group is exposed to various market risks including cryptocurrency risk, interest rate risk,
investment risk and foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk and liquidity risk associated with financial
assets and liabilities. The Group has designed and implemented various risk management strategies, which
are the same as those discussed in the Annual Financial Statements, to ensure the exposure to these risks is
consistent with its risk tolerance and business objectives.

Investment risk
The Group is exposed to investment risk from investment transactions such as the purchase of
cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products and investment in unlisted equity instruments. These
investments are not principal-guaranteed, and the Group may suffer material loss from such investments. The
Group monitors its investments closely and limits its exposure to the investment risk by including in its
operation strategy the requirements to, with regard to the purchase of cryptocurrency-denoted wealth
management products, invest only in robust wealth management products and the investments need to be
redeemed within the same fiscal quarter, and, with regard to the investment in the unlisted equity
instruments, perform due diligence on the prospect investees to evaluate the business soundness before
making an investment, and communicate regularly with the investee, review management report and the
latest financial statements, if any, to evaluate the stage of investment and whether any action should be
taken regarding the investment. The valuation of the unlisted equity investments requires the Group to use
unobservable inputs, and hence they are subject to uncertainty.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a
financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises mainly from cash deposited in the banks, cryptocurrencies held
in custody, cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management product
purchases.
To manage risk arising from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, the Group only transacts with
reputable financial institutions. There has been no recent history of default in relation to these financial
institutions.

BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the six month ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, substantially all of the Group’s cryptocurrencies are
stored in wallets held in the custody of Matrix Finance and Technologies Holding Company (“Matrixport
Group”), a related party. To limit exposure to credit risk relating to cryptocurrencies under custody, the Group
evaluates the system security design of the custody service provider and regularly reviews the exposure of
cryptocurrencies held in custody. The Group has further implemented internal controls to ensure the
appropriate access to the cryptocurrencies under custody and adopted the operating strategy of disposing
of the cryptocurrency for fiat currency shortly after they are earned. The Group expects that there is no
significant credit risk from non-performance by Matrixport Group.
However, bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been, and may in the future be,
subject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities. A successful security breach or
cyberattack could result in a partial or total loss of the Group’s cryptocurrencies and such a loss could have
a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition and results of operations.
The Group also has credit exposure to cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-
denoted wealth management product purchases. The Group assesses such credit risk both at contract
inception and each quarter or in shorter interval by considering the past collection experience and any
indications that the corresponding amount may not be fully collected. To manage such exposure, the Group
continuously monitors the relevant factors, such as the liquidity of the underlying cryptocurrencies, and
negative report related to the counterparty, and deals only with creditworthy counterparties and includes in
its operation strategy that the lending needs to be collected, and the wealth management products need to
be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter. Currently, the Group only conducts such transactions with the
Matrixport Group. The Group had never experienced credit losses and has no existing exposures to such
credit risk as of each end date of the consolidated statement of financial position. Consequently, credit
exposure to these transactions is not considered material.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair values are estimated at a specific point
in time, by discounting expected cash flows at rates for assets and liabilities of the same remaining maturities
and conditions. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment,
and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the
estimates.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments by valuation techniques:
Level 1 valuation: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the
measurement date.
Level 2 valuation: inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 valuation: fair value measured using significant unobservable inputs.
The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, except for the investments in unlisted equity instruments
and USDC, substantially all of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are carried at amortized
costs and the carrying amounts approximate their fair values.
Investments in unlisted equity instruments are carried at fair value with changes recorded in profit or
loss. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the fair value of unlisted equity investment - Investment A,
B and C (Note 10) were determined by the recent transaction price.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, the fair value of the cryptocurrencies lent or
invested is measured on a recurring basis at quoted price at the time the fair value of the underlying
cryptocurrencies is being measured, which the Group considers to be a Level 1 fair value input. The fair
value of the embedded derivative relating to the wealth management product is measured on a recurring
basis by taking the net asset value provided by the counterparty, which the Group considers to be a Level 2
fair value input.
The Group’s finance department performs valuations of financial instruments. The finance department
reports directly to the chief financial officer and discusses valuation processes and results with the chief
financial officer in order to comply with the Group’s accounting and reporting requirements.
The valuation procedures applied include consideration of recent transactions in the same security or
financial instrument, recent financing of the investee companies, economic and market conditions, current
and projected financial performance of the investee companies, and the investee companies’ management
team as well as potential future strategies to realize the investments.
The fair value measurement hierarchy for the Group’s financial instruments measured at fair value is as

Includes revenue generated primarily from providing management services.
For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, the Group generates 95.44% and 85.47% of proprietary
mining business revenue from BTC, respectively. The Group does not have customer accounting for 10% or
more of revenue in other revenue categories in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.
Contract assets and liabilities
A contract asset is recognized when the Group recognizes revenue before being unconditionally
entitled to the consideration under the payment terms set out in the contract. Contract assets are assessed
for expected credit losses and are reclassified to receivables when the right to the consideration has become
unconditional. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the Group did not have any contract assets.
A contract liability is recognized when the customer pays consideration for goods or services before the
Group recognizes the related revenue. A contract liability would also be recognized if the Group has an
unconditional right to receive non-refundable consideration before the Group recognizes the related revenue.
In such cases, a corresponding receivable would also be recognized. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30,
2022, the Group had contract liabilities, presented as deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated
statements of financial position, of approximately US$213.4 million and US$217.0 million. Approximately
US$7.9 million and US$67.3 million, included in the deferred revenue balance at January 1, 2021 and 2022,
respectively, was recognized as revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.
7. SEGMENT INFORMATION
As discussed in the Annual Financial Statements, the chief operating decision maker make resources
allocation decisions based on internal management functions and assess the Group’s business performance
as one integrated business instead of by separate business lines or geographical regions. Accordingly, the
Group has only one operating segment and therefore, no segment information is presented.

13. LEASES
The Group occupies most of its office premises and certain mining datacenter under lease arrangements,
which generally have an initial lease term between one and a half years to seven years. Lease contracts are
typically made for fixed periods but may have extension options. The Group accounts for lease and non-
lease component separately, where the non-lease component is charged to expense as they incur. Any
extension options in these leases have not been included in the lease liabilities unless the Group is
reasonably certain to exercise the extension option. In addition, periods after termination options are only
included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain not to be terminated. The Group does not have an
option to purchase these leased assets at the expiration of the lease periods.

17. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
In July 2021, the Board of Directors of the Group approved the adoption of the 2021 Share Incentive
Plan (the “2021 Plan”) and granted a total of approximately 112,361,000, 11,104,000, and 12,730,000 share
awards in January 2022, April 2022, and July 2022, respectively, to the designated recipients under the 2021
Plan. Each share award grants an option for the recipient to purchase one share of the Group’s ordinary
shares at an exercise price of US$0.03 per share. The majority of the share awards vest from two to seven
years and certain share awards vest immediately upon issuance. The recipient shall continue to provide
services to the Group by each vesting date. All share awards granted expire on July 20, 2031. Part of share
awards issued in July 2022 were granted to the designated recipients who begin providing services to satisfy
the condition in advance of the grant date. The relevant expenses were recognized during the period
between the service commencement date and the grant date, and the recognized expenses were trued up
based on the fair value on July 1, 2022.

expansion;
Expected volatility is estimated based on the daily close price volatility of a number of comparable
companies to the Group;

BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The shares allotted to shareholders pursuant to the Reorganization was charged to reserve.
Reserves
The Group’s reserves include the following:
Share premium, which effectively represents the share subscription amount paid over the par value
of the shares. The application of the share premium account is governed by Section 34 of the
Companies Law, Cap. 22 (Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.
Invested capital reclassified upon completion of the Reorganization.
All foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign
operations excluding the effects resulted from the activities the Bitdeer Business conducted in
direct and indirect subsidiaries of Bitmain and BTC, which were included in invested capital.
The value of the conversion option of the equity component embedded in the convertible debt.
The accumulated share-based payment expenses.
Capital management
The Group’s primary objective in terms of managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for
other stakeholders, mainly by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group’s business and financial condition are highly correlated with the market price of
cryptocurrencies. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, the Group’s revenue is substantially
generated from cryptocurrency-related operations. The Group has adopted various measures to minimize the
risk associated with the fluctuation in the market price of cryptocurrencies, specifically, the Group has
implemented an internal strategy requiring prompt conversion of all the cryptocurrencies received from
ordinary operations into fiat currencies.
The Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to maintain a balance
between the higher shareholder returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
19. TAXATION
The subsidiaries of the Group incorporated in Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) are not
subject to tax on income or capital gain. In addition, payments of dividends by the Group to their
shareholders are not subject to withholding tax in Cayman Islands.
The subsidiaries of the Group incorporated in other countries are subject to income tax pursuant to the
rules and regulations of their respective countries of incorporation.
The provisions for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022 are summarized as
follows:

Deferred tax assets charged to invested capital is due to the Group recognizing deferred tax assets
related to tax losses carried forward based on the tax losses available to the individual legal entities
within the Group during the Carve-out Period, which creates differences between the income tax benefit
or expense determined based on the operation results of the Bitdeer Business.
The Group has not recognized deductible temporary differences and a portion of the tax loss
carryforward because the criteria for recognition (i.e. the probability of future taxable profits) were not met.
The gross value of such unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences will expire as follows:

Balances and transactions with Bitmain and BTC
During the Carve-out Period, the Group and BTC were integrated into the group-wide operation directed
by Bitmain before the completion of the Reorganization.
The activities between the Group and Bitmain and BTC before the completion date of the Reorganization
were presented as related party transactions in the condensed combined and consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in invested capital and equity for six months
ended on June 30, 2021. The invested capital represents Bitmain’s historical investment in the Group, the net
effect of allocations from transactions with Bitmain and BTC, and the Group’s accumulated retained earnings.
Upon completion of the Reorganization, the Group started operating on a stand-alone basis and Bitmain
and BTC no longer hold equity interest, exercise significant influence over, or act as an affiliate of the Group
and its operations. As a result, Bitmain and BTC ceased to be related parties to the Group.
A reconciliation of deemed distribution to related parties to the corresponding amounts presented in the
condensed combined and consolidated statement of cash flows for six months ended on June 30, 2021 is as

The Group purchased two types of wealth management products during the six months ended June 30,
2022. Wealth management product type A represents the Group’s units of interest in the underlying
cryptocurrency trading account and the value of the units is based on the performance of the trading
account. The Group has the right to redeem the units with Matrixport Group based on the value on the
redemption date during certain days of each month. See Note 2(h) to the Annual Financial Statements
regarding the accounting policy for cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products.
Wealth management product type B represents the Group’s variable-interest cryptocurrency deposit at
Matrixport Group. The deposit is not protected by any deposit insurance scheme and non-secured, and the
Group may lose some or all of the amount deposited in extreme market conditions. Upon withdrawal, the
Group receives the same type of cryptocurrency in the same quantity in principle plus additional interest
returns. The deposit can be withdrawn on demand and is generally delivered to the Group within 72 hours.
The nature of the wealth management product type B is, in essence, a cryptocurrency lending arrangement.
See Note 2(h) to the Annual Financial Statements regarding the accounting policy for cryptocurrency
lending arrangements.
The Group received interest income from the lending and return from the wealth management product in
total amount of approximately US$0.4 million and US$0.3 million denoted in cryptocurrencies, respectively.
As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the balances of cryptocurrency receivables and embedded
derivative were both nil. The change in fair value of the cryptocurrencies lent or invested, and the embedded
derivative relating to the wealth management product type A are immaterial as the arrangements are short-
term in nature and the quoted prices of USDT and USDC are relatively stable.
To facilitate the lending and wealth management products purchases, the Group purchased the
aforementioned cryptocurrencies using approximately US$186 million. The total receipts from the collection
of lending and redemption of wealth management products were disposed of by the Group for approximately
US$191 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022.
21. EARNINGS / (LOSS) PER SHARE
The calculation of basic earnings / (loss) per share is based on the profit or loss attributable to ordinary
equity shareholders of the Group and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the six-
month period ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.
Diluted earnings / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares
and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the respective periods.
As the Group incurred losses for the six months ended June 30, 2022, the potential ordinary shares
related to the outstanding share awards and convertible debt were not included in the calculation of dilutive
loss per share, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying combined and consolidated statements of financial position of
Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and
2020, and the related combined and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss),
changes in invested capital and equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Restatement of the 2019, 2020 and 2021 Financial Statements
As discussed in Note 2(a) to the financial statements, the accompanying combined statements of
operation and comprehensive income/(loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the
accompanying combined and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021,
2020 and 2019 have been restated to correct certain misstatements.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are
required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.

BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION
General information
Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company (the “Company” or “Bitdeer”) is a limited liability company
incorporated in the Cayman Islands on November 18, 2020. The address of its registered office is 89 Nexus
Way, Camana Bay, Grand Cayman KY1-9009, Cayman Islands.
The Company does not conduct any substantive operations on its own but conducts its primary
operations through its subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) are principally
engaged in the following business activities:
Offering to its customers plan subscriptions, from which the customers receive computing service in
quantity measured in hash rate and benefit from such service as a result of directing the computing
service to mining pools and receiving cryptocurrency rewards (the “Cloud Hash Rate business”);
Using the Group’s mining machines to provide computing power to mining pools in exchange for
cryptocurrency rewards (the “Proprietary Mining business”); and
Providing dynamic hosting solutions in the Group’s mining datacenters (the “Hosting business”,
together with Cloud Hash Rate business and Proprietary Mining business, the “Bitdeer Business”).
Reorganization
Separation from Bitmain
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the period from January 1, 2021 to January 26,
2021, the Bitdeer Business and the mining pool business, including the ownership of and registration right to
the domain name btc.com (the “BTC.com Pool Business” or “BTC”), were operated through a number of
entities controlled by BitMain Technologies Holding Company (collectively with its subsidiaries, “Bitmain”).
The Company was created to separate the Bitdeer Business and the BTC.com Pool Business following a
corporate reorganization of Bitmain to effectuate the separation. The separation from Bitmain resulted in the
transfer of certain assets, liabilities and contracts related to the Bitdeer Business and the BTC.com Pool
Business at their historical book values from Bitmain to the Company on January 26, 2021, when Bitmain
distributed by way of dividend in kind the shares of the Company to the then existing Bitmain shareholders
and the Company and its subsidiaries began to operate on a stand-alone basis.
Separation of the BTC.com Pool Business
In February 2021, the Group established Blockchain Alliance Technologies Holding Company
(“Blockchain Alliance”) to separate the BTC.com Pool Business following a corporate reorganization of the
Group to effectuate the separation. The separation was consummated on April 15, 2021, when the Group
distributed by way of dividend in kind the shares of Blockchain Alliance to the then existing shareholders of
the Group.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a. Basis of preparation
The accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (“IASB”).
The combined and consolidated historical financial statements comprise the following financial
information:
F-55 •

(i) 
(ii) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the combined financial position of the Bitdeer Business as of December 31, 2020 and the
combined results of operations of the Bitdeer Business during the years ended December 31,
2019 and 2020, and the period from January 1, 2021 to April 15, 2021 (the “Carve-out Period”),
which have been prepared on a carve-out basis; and
the consolidated financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2021 and the consolidated
results of operations of the Group for the period from April 16, 2021 to December 31, 2021, which
have been prepared on a consolidated basis (together, the “combined and consolidated financial
statements”).
Preparing combined financial statements of Bitdeer Business on a carve-out basis
Pursuant to the Reorganization discussed in Note 1, the Group prepared the combined financial
statements to capture the stand-alone Bitdeer Business, which has historically operated as part of
Bitmain. The Group also excluded the assets, liabilities, operation results and cash flows of BTC.com
Pool Business from its combined financial statements as a result of the Reorganization. The combined
financial statements have not historically been prepared for the Bitdeer business.
In preparing the combined historical financial information, certain accounting conventions commonly
used for the preparation of combined historical financial information have been applied. The term
“combined financial statements” is used when referring to financial information prepared by
aggregating financial statements of separate entities or components of groups that fail to meet the
definition of a “group” under IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements. A key assumption underlying
the preparation of combined financial statements is that there is a binding element for the economic
activities throughout the period presented. The combined financial statements of the Group have been
prepared by aggregating the financial information of the Bitdeer Business that was bound together by
common control but was not a legal group. Intra-group transactions and the balances and unrealized
gains or losses have been eliminated in the preparation of the combined financial statements.
The combined financial statements of the Bitdeer Business are derived from the historical accounting
records of Bitmain on the following basis:
The combined statements of financial position of the Bitdeer Business include all assets and
liabilities that have been determined to be directly attributable to the Bitdeer Business. Certain
assets and liabilities historically arising from Bitmain’s business (non Bitdeer Business) have
been attributed to the combined financial statements as they were transferred to the Group
during the Reorganization. The most significant of which were due from and due to Bitmain
balances recorded under amounts due from related parties and amounts due to related parties
in the combined and consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2020.
Transactions between the Bitdeer Business, Bitmain and BTC during the Carve-out Period
were accounted for as related party transactions. Internal financing transactions, including
equity transactions in the nature of internal financing, between the Bitdeer Business, Bitmain
and BTC are included in the investing and financing activities and operating transactions
between the Bitdeer Business, Bitmain and BTC are included in the operating activities in the
combined and consolidated statements of cash flows.
The combined statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss) of the Bitdeer
Business include all revenues and costs directly attributable to the Bitdeer Business. These
include certain common operating and administrative expenses incurred by the Bitdeer
Business in conjunction with other business operations of Bitmain and BTC, including
financial, human resources, office administration and other support functions. These costs
have been allocated on a basis considered reasonable by management using either specific
identification or proportional allocations based on usage, headcount, or other reasonable
methods of allocation. Income tax expense was estimated based on the statutory tax rate,
adjusted as appropriate for
F-56 
(iii) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the effects of known non-taxable and non-deductible items reported in the combined
statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss) as described above. However, the
combined financial statements of the Bitdeer Business may not reflect the actual costs that
would have been incurred and may not be indicative of the Bitdeer Business’s combined
results, financial position, and cash flows had it been operating on a separate, stand-alone
basis during the periods presented.
The Bitdeer Business did not comprise a separate legal entity or group of entities during the
Carve-out Period. Therefore, it is not meaningful to present share capital or an analysis of
reserves. The Group’s equity balance represented the excess or deficits of total assets over
total liabilities and was presented as invested capital in the combined and consolidated
statements of financial position. Changes in net assets attributed to the Group are presented
separately in the combined and consolidated statement of changes in invested capital and
equity through the line item “deemed contribution from / (distribution to) related parties”.
Equity transactions reflecting the internal financing between Bitdeer Business, Bitmain and
BTC are included in the financing activities, presented as deemed contribution from /
(distribution to) related parties, in the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows.
Consolidation
Subsequent to the Carve-out Period, the Group’s financial information is prepared on a consolidated
basis, for which the consolidation policies are described below.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity where the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are
fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated
from the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and
its subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides
evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Restatement of financial statements
Presentation on the sale of mining machines
During 2021, the Group identified an error in presenting the revenue from the sale of the mining machine
as the difference between the selling price and the remaining net book value of the associated mining
machine under IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment. As the sale of mining machines represents
contracts with customers in the Group’s ordinary course of business, the transactions should have
been accounted for under IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue from the sale of
mining machines should have been recognized at the amount of promised consideration to which the
Group is expected to be entitled, and the cost of revenue should have been recognized at the net book
value of the mining machines sold. See Note 2(p) for a detailed discussion on the revenue recognition
policy associated with the sale of mining machines. The previously reported combined financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 are restated to correct the above error.
Cash flow presentation on the disposal of cryptocurrencies earned from revenue arrangements
The Group restated the presentation of disposal of cryptocurrencies earned from revenue arrangements
from operating activities to investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as IAS 7 has
indicated receipts from sales of intangible assets and debt investments are expected to be classified as
investing activities. See Note 2(h) for the accounting policy related to the disposal of cryptocurrencies.

NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
c. Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the combined and consolidated financial statements of each of the Group’s
subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
subsidiary operates (the “functional currency”). The Group presents its combined and consolidated
financial statements in United States Dollars (“USD”, “US$”, or “$”).
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions during the year are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the
transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
foreign exchange rates ruling at the end of the reporting period. Exchange gains and losses are
recognized in profit or loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency
are translated using the foreign exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates. The transaction date is
the date on which the Group initially recognizes such non-monetary assets or liabilities.
Foreign currency translation
The results and financial position of foreign operations that have a functional currency different from
the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
assets and liabilities for each combined and consolidated statement of financial position presented
are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet,
income and expenses for each combined and consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive income / (loss) are translated at average exchange rates, and
all resulting exchange differences are recognized in invested capital and reserves.
d. Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.
Judgments made by management in the application of IFRSs that have significant effects on the
financial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are discussed in Note 3.
The outbreak of the 2019 novel strain of coronavirus causing a contagious respiratory disease known as
COVID-19, and the subsequent restrictive measures including social distancing, quarantine imposed by
the governments around the world, and related travel and trade restrictions have caused disruption to
businesses and resulted in significant global economic impacts. As at the date of this report, these
impacts have not had a significant effect on the Group’s financial results or operations. However, as the
impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve, including changes in government policy and business
reactions thereto, if the Group’s staff are unable to work or travel due to illness or government
restrictions, the Group may be

forced to reduce or suspend its construction and development activities. In addition, as the COVID-19
pandemic and mitigation measures have also negatively impacted global economic conditions, this, in
turn, could adversely affect the Group’s business in the future. Due to the continually evolving nature
of COVID-19, the management cannot reasonably estimate the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic
could have on the Group in future periods and believes that any disturbance may be temporary.
However, there is uncertainty about the length and potential impact of any resultant disturbance. As a
result, the Group is unable to estimate the potential impact on its future operations as at the date of
these financial statements.
e. Related parties
A party is considered to be related to the Group if:
the party is a person or a close member of that person’s family and that person
has control or joint control over the Group;
has significant influence over the Group; or
is a member of the key management personnel of the Group or a parent of the Group;
the party is an entity where any of the following conditions applies:
the entity and the Group are members of the same Group;
one entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or of a parent, subsidiary or
fellow subsidiary of the other entity);
the entity and the Group are joint ventures of the same third party;
one entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the
third entity;
the entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the
Group or an entity related to the Group;
the entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a);
a person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the
key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity); or
the entity, or any member of the Group of which it is a part, provides key management
personnel services to the Group or the parent of the Group.
Close members of the family of a person are those family members who may be expected to influence, or
be influenced by, that person in their dealings with the entity.
Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s-length basis,
as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about
transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were
consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.
f. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in banks and on hand and short-term, highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash which are subject to an
insignificant risk of
F-60 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
changes in value and are within three months of maturity at acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents are
assessed for expected credit losses. See further discussion regarding expected credit loss in Note 2(t).
The Group is required to hold a defined amount of cash as security under the terms of standby letters of
credits arrangement. See further discussion in Note 5.
g. Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognized when the Group has an unconditional right to receive consideration. A
right to receive consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of
that consideration is due. Trade receivables are stated at amortized cost, less a loss allowance based on
lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. See further discussion regarding expected credit
loss in Note 2(t).
h. Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies includes USD Coin (“USDC”) and cryptocurrencies other than USDC held in the
Group’s cryptocurrency wallets.
USDC
USDC is accounted for as a financial instrument as one USDC can be redeemed for one U.S. dollar on
demand from the issuer. USDC, classified as a debt investment, is measured at fair value through profit
or loss.
Cryptocurrencies other than USDC
Cryptocurrencies other than USDC are, by their nature, identifiable non-monetary assets that lack
physical substance. Future economic benefits attributable to these cryptocurrencies are expected to
flow to the Group because these cryptocurrencies can be exchanged for fiat currencies. Furthermore, the
cost of the Group’s cryptocurrencies other than USDC can be measured using the quoted price of such
cryptocurrencies at the time the fair value is being measured.
The Group accounts for the cryptocurrencies other than USDC as intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives in its combined and consolidated statements of financial position because, at the time of
assessment, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which such assets are expected to generate
cash flows.
The Group further adopts the cost model to account for cryptocurrencies other than USDC and reviews
their useful life and impairment at each reporting date in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets. The
Group accounts for cryptocurrencies other than USDC at cost, instead of revaluing these
cryptocurrencies at their fair value on each accounting reference date, because the latter model is
subject to inherent and substantial volatility in the value of these cryptocurrencies from time to time. In
addition, the Group believes that the cost model better reflects the Group’s business model, as the
Group is not engaged in the cryptocurrency trading business.
Gains or losses arising from the disposal of cryptocurrencies other than USDC are determined as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets. The Group
recognizes realized gains or losses on the date of the disposal using the first-in-first-out method of
accounting.
Cryptocurrency lending arrangements
The Group enters into arrangements with counterparties to lend cryptocurrencies on an unsecured
basis. No collateral is held for the cryptocurrencies lent. Upon lending, the Group derecognizes the
cryptocurrencies lent and concurrently recognizes cryptocurrency receivables which are measured at
the fair value of the cryptocurrencies lent based on their respective quoted prices initially and
subsequently on the measurement date and adjusted for expected credit losses. Any differences
between the carrying
F-61 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
amount of the derecognized cryptocurrencies and the initial measurement of the cryptocurrency
receivables, if applicable, and the change in fair value of the cryptocurrencies lent, are recognized in
other operating income / (expenses) on the combined and consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income / (loss). See further discussion regarding credit losses from cryptocurrency
receivables in Note 2(t). Also refer to Note 17 for more information.
Cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products
The Group enters into arrangements with the Matrixport Group, a related party, to purchase
cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products which represent units of interest in the
underlying cryptocurrency trading account and the value of the units is based on the performance of
the trading account managed by the Matrixport Group. The Group derecognizes the cryptocurrencies
paid and concurrently recognizes a cryptocurrency receivable which gives rise to a variable return
linked to the performance of the underlying trading account. The receivable contains an embedded
derivative which is accounted for separately as an asset or liability based on the change in the fair value
of the trading account. The cryptocurrency receivable is measured at the fair value of the
cryptocurrencies invested based on their respective quoted prices on the measurement date and
adjusted for expected credit losses. Any differences between the carrying amount of the derecognized
cryptocurrencies and the initial measurement of the cryptocurrency receivables, if applicable, and the
change in fair value of the cryptocurrencies invested, are recognized in other operating income /
(expenses) on the combined and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income /
(loss). See further discussion regarding credit losses from cryptocurrency receivables in Note 2(t). Also
refer to Note 17 for more information.
The Group presents the revenue recognized on the acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which is a non-cash
item, as an adjustment to remove the non-cash item for the cash flows from operating activities and the
disposals of cryptocurrencies received in revenue arrangements are presented as cash flows from
investing activities in the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows. The purchases and
disposals of cryptocurrencies associated with investment or lending transactions are presented as
investing activities in the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows.
i. Prepaid expenses and other assets
Prepaid expenses represent prepayments made for operational purposes, such as prepaid utility fees and
property management expenses. Prepaid expenses are amortized over their future beneficial periods
using the straight-line method or at a point in time upon the Group’s receipt of the underlying goods or
service.
Other assets generally consisted of deposits paid to various service providers, such as lessors and
electricity vendors.
j. Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortization (where the
estimated useful life is finite) and impairment losses.
Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line
basis over the assets’ estimated useful life, which is the period over which an asset is expected to be
available for use. The estimates and associated assumptions of useful life determined by the Group are
based on technical or commercial obsolescence, legal or contractual limits on the use of the asset, and
other relevant factors. The following intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized from the
date they are available for use and their estimated useful lives are as follows:
Software
3
years
Both the period and method of amortization are reviewed annually.

NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Intangible assets are not amortized while their useful lives are assessed to be indefinite. Any conclusion
that the useful life of an intangible asset is indefinite is reviewed annually to determine whether events
and circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life assessment for that asset. If they do
not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for prospectively from
the date of change and in accordance with the policy for amortization of intangible assets with finite
lives as set out above.
k. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses, if any.
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at purchase cost. Direct labor and other directly attributable
costs incurred to construct new assets and upgrade existing assets are capitalized. Repairs and
maintenance expenditures are recognized in the combined and consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income / (loss) as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful lives of the assets as follows:
Buildings
20 years
Land
Unlimited
Machinery
3 - 10 years
Electronic equipment
3 - 7 years
Leasehold improvements
3 years
Land acquired by the Group has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.
The depreciation method, useful life and residual value of an asset are reviewed at least at each financial
year-end and adjusted, if appropriate.
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, their cost and the related accumulated depreciation
are derecognized from the combined and consolidated statements of financial position and the resulting
gains or losses on the disposal or sale of the assets are recognized in the combined and consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss).
An asset under construction is stated at cost until the construction is completed, at which time it is
reclassified to the property, plant and equipment account to which it relates. During the construction
period until the asset is ready for its intended use or sale, borrowing costs, which include interest
expense and foreign currency exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the
extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest expense, are capitalized in proportion to the
average amount of accumulated expenditures during the period. Capitalization of borrowing costs
ceases when the construction is completed, and the asset is ready for its intended use or sale.
l. Mining machines
Mining machines refer to the electronic equipment designed for the sole purpose of completing complex
mathematical functions to verify transactions on the blockchain. Mining machines are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The Group estimated the useful lives of the
mining machines to be one to two years. This estimate is primarily based on the historical measures of
(i) the period when each mining machine is able to deliver expected performance and (ii) the frequency
of technological advancement, which leads to a new generation of mining machines. The Group also
estimates the residual value of the mining machines at the expected time of disposal, taking into
consideration factors such as make and model. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
F-63

NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
estimated useful lives. The depreciation method, useful life and residual value of the mining machines
are reviewed at least at each financial year-end and adjusted, if appropriate.
The Group routinely sells used mining machines to customers. The net carrying values of the associated
mining machines were reclassified as inventories when the Group identified such mining machines for
sale and were recognized as cost of revenue on the combined and consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income / (loss) upon the sale. See Note 2(p).
When mining machines are retired, their costs and the related accumulated depreciation are
derecognized from the combined and consolidated statements of financial position and the resulting
gains or losses on the disposal of the assets are recognized in the combined and consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss).
m. Leases
The Group accounts for leases under IFRS 16 Leases. At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses
whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
At inception or on a reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates
the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative
stand-alone prices.
At the lease commencement date, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, except
for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets which,
for the Group, are primarily vehicles. When the Group enters into a lease in respect of a low-value asset,
the Group decides whether to capitalize the lease on a lease-by-lease basis. The lease payments
associated with those leases which are not capitalized are recognized as an expense on a systematic
basis over the lease term.
Where the lease is capitalized, the lease liability is initially recognized at the present value of the lease
payments payable over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that
rate cannot be readily determined, using a relevant incremental borrowing rate. After initial recognition,
the lease liability is measured at amortized cost and interest expense is calculated using the effective
interest method. Variable lease payments linked to the use of an underlying asset are excluded from the
measurement of lease liabilities.
The right-of-use asset recognized when a lease is capitalized is initially measured at cost, which
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability plus any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, and any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use asset is subsequently stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets are
subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of
the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the unexpired term of the lease. The
estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property,
plant and equipment.
The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change
in an index or rate, or there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable
under a residual value guarantee, or there is a change arising from the reassessment of whether the
Group will be reasonably certain to exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease
liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has
been reduced to zero.
n. Trade payables and other payables and accruals
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and/or services that have been acquired from suppliers
in the ordinary course of business. Other payables and accruals primarily represent obligations to pay
staff costs, surtaxes and value-added tax, and other operating service providers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Trade payables and other payables and accruals are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
o. Share-based payments
Employees (including senior executives and members of the board of directors) and certain service
providers of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions,
whereby they render services as consideration for equity instruments (“equity-settled transactions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which
they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in equity,
over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on
which the beneficiary becomes fully entitled to the equity-settled transactions (the “vesting date”). The
cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the
number of equity-settled transactions that will ultimately vest which includes assumptions on the
number of equity-settled transactions to be forfeited due to the grantees’ failing to fulfill the service
condition, and forfeitures following the non-completion of performance conditions.
p. Revenue recognition
The Group’s revenues are derived principally from the cloud hash rate arrangements, the proprietary
mining arrangements, the cloud hosting arrangements, the sales of mining machines, and the general
hosting arrangements.
Revenue is recognized when control over goods or services is transferred to the customer, at the
amount of promised consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled. Revenue excludes
value-added tax (“VAT”) or other sales taxes and is after deduction of trade discount, if any.
Revenue is recognized applying the following five steps:
Identify the contract with a customer;
Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
Determine the transaction price;
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
Recognize revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation.
For arrangements priced at fiat currency, the Group recognizes revenue based on the contract price. For
arrangement priced at cryptocurrency, the Group recognizes revenue based on the spot price of the
cryptocurrency to fiat currency on the date when it is earned.
When another party is involved in providing services to a customer, the Group is the principal if it
controls the specified services before those services are transferred to the customer.
The primary sources of the Group’s revenues are recognized as follows:
Cloud Hash Rate
The Group enters into Cloud Hash Rate arrangements with its customers by offering hash rate
subscription plans to provide computing power in a specified quantity, measured by computing power
per second, or hash rate, derived from the mining machines held by the Group, for a specified period of
time. The customer also needs to pay for electricity subscriptions, which are billed separately, to
maintain
F-65 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the mining machines that produce the subscribed hash rate over the contract period. The Group
connects such computing power to a customer-designated mining pool under the instructions of the
customer to simplify the customer’s mining experiences. As a result of directing the connection of such
computing power to the mining pools, the customers are entitled to the mining rewards, which are
directly transferred from mining pools to the customer-designated cryptocurrency wallets.
The Group offers a number of different hash rate subscription plans by plan duration and type of
cryptocurrency to be mined. The Group offers electricity subscriptions in short durations and a
customer needs to purchase electricity subscriptions multiple times to cover the duration of the hash
rate subscription plan. The price of the electricity subscription is fixed at the commencement of each
electricity subscription period but subject to adjustment from period to period. Both cryptocurrency and
fiat currency are accepted as payments under the Cloud Hash Rate arrangements. Furthermore, the hash
rate subscription plans are offered under two modes. Under the classic mode, the customer receives all
of the mining rewards from the mining pool. Under the accelerator mode, the customer pays a relatively
lower computing power subscription fee. In exchange, the Group is entitled to additional consideration
once the customer’s cost is recovered.
The Group offers two promises under the Cloud Hash Rate arrangement. One is to provide a specified
quantity of computing power during a period of time and the other is to provide maintenance services
for computing power generation for a period of time. The two promises are highly interrelated and are
not separately identifiable because the customers expect to receive the computing power as a combined
output from the hash rate subscription plan and the electricity subscription plan. The two promises
provide a series of distinct services, which are substantially the same and have the same pattern of
transfer to the customer, over a period of time. As a result, the promises are treated as a single
performance obligation satisfied over time.
The transaction price of the performance obligation includes the subscription prices for the hash rate
subscription plans and the electricity subscription plans. As the price for the electricity subscription
plans may change each electricity subscription period, the Group allocates the variable consideration to
each electricity subscription period.
The control of the computing power has been transferred to the customers simultaneously as the
customers consume the benefits from the computing power. The revenue is recognized over time where
the consideration related to the hash rate subscription is recognized evenly over the contract term and
the electricity subscription is allocated to and recognized evenly over each electricity subscription
period.
For plans under the accelerator mode, besides the aforementioned subscription prices, the transaction
price also includes the additional consideration once the customer’s cost is recovered. The additional
consideration, which is variable, is determined as a percentage of a customer’s mining profit derived
from the subscribed computing power and constrained until the mining pool operator finishes the
calculation of the mining reward related to the mining activity in a given day. The Group includes such
additional consideration in the transaction price and recognizes the revenue when the Group can
reasonably calculate the amount and determine it is probable a significant reversal will not occur.
Proprietary Mining
The Group enters into contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power generated from
the Group’s own mining machines to the mining pools. The contracts with mining pool operators are
terminable at any time by either party. In exchange for providing computing power to the mining pool,
the Group is entitled to cryptocurrency rewards from the mining pool operators, which is a variable
consideration calculated based on a predetermined formula agreed by the Group and the mining pool
operator as a part of the arrangement. The variable consideration is constrained until the Group can
reasonably estimate the amount of mining rewards by the end of a given day based on the actual
amount of computing power provided to the mining pool operators. By then, the Group considers it is
highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenues will not occur and includes such
variable
F-66 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
consideration in the transaction price. Providing computing power is an output of the Group’s ordinary
activities and the only performance obligation in the Group’s contracts with mining pool operators. The
Group recognizes the revenue when the variable consideration is no longer constrained and the
performance obligation of providing computing power has been satisfied. Although the cryptocurrency
rewards the mining pool operators receive from the blockchain networks include both the block rewards
and the transaction verification fees, the transaction price the Group receives is an aggregate amount
and primarily includes the block rewards. As a result, the Group does not present disaggregated
revenue information on block rewards and transaction verification fees.
Cloud Hosting
The Group provides its customers, through subscription of Cloud Hosting orders, one-stop mining
machines hosting solution which integrates the provision of computing power generated from specified
second-hand mining machines and the provision of maintenance service, primarily including electricity
supply and daily maintenance and repair care. The Group charges the customer an upfront fixed amount
at the commencement of the Cloud Hosting arrangement for the customer to secure the procurement of
the computing power from the specified mining machines, as well as the variable fees for the provision
of maintenance service based on the consumption of resources such as electricity throughout the
duration of the service. The Group historically only accepts cryptocurrency as payments for services
under the Cloud Hosting arrangement.
The Cloud Hosting arrangements are offered under two modes. Under the classic mode, the customer
receives all of the mining rewards from the mining pool. Under the accelerator mode, the customer is
charged with a lower upfront amount and enjoys a quicker recovery of the costs. In exchange, the Group
is entitled to additional consideration once a customer’s cost is recovered.
Two promises are offered under the Cloud Hosting arrangements. One is to provide the computing
power generated from the specified mining machines and the other is to perform maintenance services
over the life of the mining machines. The two promises are not separately identifiable because the
customer expects to receive a steady operation of the mining machines specified in the Cloud Hosting
order, which is a combined output of the provision of computing power from the specified mining
machines and the provision of maintenance service of the specified mining machines. The two promises
provide a series of distinct services, which are substantially the same and have the same pattern of
transfer to the customer, over a period of time. As a result, the promises are treated as a single
performance obligation satisfied over time.
The transaction price of the performance obligation includes an upfront fee paid upon placement of the
Cloud Hosting order and periodical maintenance fees. The periodical maintenance fee is variable in each
maintenance period based on the electricity consumption. The Group allocates the variable
consideration to each distinct maintenance service period.
The revenue is recognized over time where the fixed upfront fee is recognized evenly over the contract
term and the periodical maintenance fee is recognized over each respective service period. The contract
term approximates to the life of the specified mining machines and is estimated to be two years. The
estimated life of these mining machines is reviewed at least at each financial year-end and adjusted if the
expectation of the realization of economic benefits from the specified mining machines is different from
the previous estimate.
For plans under the accelerator mode, besides the aforementioned fees, the transaction price also
includes the additional consideration once the customer’s cost is recovered. The additional
consideration, which is variable, is determined as a percentage of a customer’s mining profit derived
from the computing power of the specified mining machines and constrained until the mining pool
operator finishes the calculation of the mining reward related to the mining activity in a given day. The
Group includes such additional consideration in the transaction price and recognizes revenues when the
Group can reasonably calculate

NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the amount and determine it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. For all the periods
presented, no revenue was generated from the additional consideration from Cloud Hosting
arrangements offered under the accelerator mode.
Sale of Mining Machines
The Group recognizes revenue from sales of mining machines to customers at the point in time when
control of the mining machines is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment of
the mining machines as defined in the revenue contract. Sale of mining machine is the sole performance
obligation in this type of arrangement. The Group accepts both cryptocurrency and fiat currency as
payments for sales of mining machines.
General Hosting
The Group provides general hosting services, which is a combined service package including custody
of the customers’ mining machines, electricity and network maintenance and other services, that enable
customers to run blockchain computing operations. The customer is only able to benefit from the
hosting service as a package and the Group has a single performance obligation. The hosting service
fee is charged to the customer monthly as a single fee based on the customer’s consumption of
resources, such as the amount of electricity used in a period. Revenue from the general hosting service
is recognized across each service cycle. The Group accepts both cryptocurrency and fiat currency as
payments for the hosting services.
Details of revenues for each category are as follows:

BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Contract assets and liabilities
A contract asset is recognized when the Group recognizes revenue before being unconditionally
entitled to the consideration under the payment terms set out in the contract. Contract assets are
assessed for expected credit losses and are reclassified to receivables when the right to the
consideration has become unconditional. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Group did not have any
contract assets.
A contract liability is recognized when the customer pays consideration for goods or services before the
Group recognizes the related revenue. A contract liability would also be recognized if the Group has an
unconditional right to receive non-refundable consideration before the Group recognizes the related
revenue. In such cases, a corresponding receivable would also be recognized. As of December 31, 2020
and 2021, the Group had contract liabilities, presented as deferred revenue on the combined and
consolidated statements of financial position, of approximately US$11.6 million and US$213.4 million.
Approximately US$0.2 million, US$10.3 million and US$11.1 million, included in the deferred revenue
balance at January 1, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, was recognized as revenue during the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.
q. Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of electricity expenses incurred for operating the Group’s mining
machines in its revenue-generating activities, depreciation expense from the mining machines and
datacenters hosting those mining machines, costs of mining machines sold to customers, and
compensation expenses incurred by mining datacenter personnel.
r. Taxes
Income tax
Current and deferred income taxes are recognized as income or expense and included in the combined
and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss), except to the extent that
the income tax relates to items recognized in comprehensive income / (loss) or directly in equity, in
which case the relevant amounts of tax are recognized in comprehensive income / (loss) or directly in
equity, respectively.
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered or paid
by using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting
date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax reporting process with respect to
situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. Where appropriate,
management establishes provisions based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from deductible and taxable temporary differences respectively,
being the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets also arise from unused tax losses and unused tax
credits.
Apart from the temporary differences arising from goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, all deferred
tax liabilities, and all deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilized, are recognized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates and tax laws at each reporting date which are
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to compensate part or all of the benefits of
deferred tax assets. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and
recognized
F-69 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
if it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for recovery. Tax deductions arising from the
reversal of deferred tax assets are excluded from estimates of future taxable income.
Deferred taxes on transactions which are recognized outside profit or loss are recognized outside profit
or loss. Therefore, deferred taxes on these transactions are recognized either in comprehensive income /
(loss) or recognized directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in the combined and consolidated statements of financial
position, if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and liabilities and
the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same Tax Authority on either
the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and
assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future
period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or
settled.
Uncertainty over income tax treatments
The Group determines the recognition and measurement of tax assets and liabilities that contain
uncertainty over income tax by considering the assumptions used in the examination of tax treatments
by the tax authorities, the probability that the tax authorities will accept uncertain tax treatment and re-
consideration or estimation if there is a change in facts and circumstances.
If the acceptance of tax treatment is probable, the measurement is in line with income tax fillings. If the
acceptance of tax treatment is not probable, the Group uses tax amounts using the method that provides
a better prediction of resolution (i.e., most likely amount or expected value). Due to the complexity of
some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different
from current estimates. Any such differences will be reflected as adjustments to income tax expenses in
the periods in which they are determined.
s. Financial instruments
The Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in the accounting of financial instruments. As of
December 31, 2020 and 2021, all existing financial instruments are classified and measured at amortized
cost, except for USDC, which is discussed in Note 2(h).
The Group’s financial assets, other than USDC, are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest
method less provision for impairment. Gains and losses arising from the disposal, being the differences
between the net sales proceeds and the carrying values, are recognized in the statements of operations
and comprehensive income / (loss).
Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or
the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets.
The Group’s financial liabilities are classified and measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method.
Financial liabilities are derecognized when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,
canceled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized
and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the statement of
financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities
simultaneously.
Convertible debt
As disclosed in Note 11, in 2021, the Group issued a convertible debt that can be converted into
ordinary shares of the Group at the option of the holder. The number of shares to be issued is fixed and
does not
F-70

NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
vary with changes in fair value. The Group accounts for the components of this compound financial
instrument separately as a financial liability and an equity instrument. The liability component of the
convertible debt is initially recognized at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity
conversion option. The equity component is initially recognized at the difference between the fair value
of the convertible debt as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable
transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial
carrying amounts. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of the convertible debt is
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component is not
remeasured.
Interest related to the financial liability is recognized in profit or loss. Upon conversion, the financial
liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss will be recognized.
t. Credit losses and impairment of assets
(i) Credit losses from financial instruments
The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial assets, such as
cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and trade receivable, which are measured at amortized cost.
Measurement of ECLs
ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present
value of all expected cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in
accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). The expected cash
shortfalls are discounted using the following discount rates where the effect of discounting is material:
fixed-rate financial assets, trade and other receivables: effective interest rate determined at initial
recognition or an approximation thereof;
variable-rate financial assets: current effective interest rate.
The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which
the Group is exposed to credit risk.
In measuring ECLs, the Group takes into account reasonable and supportable information that is
available without undue cost or effort. This includes information about past events, current conditions
and forecasts of future economic conditions.
ECLs are measured on either of the following bases:
12-month ECLs: these are losses that are expected to result from possible default events within the 12
months after the reporting date; and
lifetime ECLs: these are losses that are expected to result from all possible default events over the
expected lives of the items to which the ECL model applies.
Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. ECL on
this type of financial asset is estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit
loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors and an assessment of both the
current and forecast general economic conditions at the reporting date.
For all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes a loss allowance equal to 12-month ECLs
unless there has been a significant increase in the credit risk of the financial instrument since initial
recognition, in which case the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.
Significant increases in credit risk
In assessing whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial
recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument assessed at

BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the reporting date with that assessed at the date of initial recognition. In making this reassessment, the
Group considers that a default event occurs when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations
to the Group in full and without recourse. The Group considers both quantitative and qualitative
information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking
information that is available without undue cost or effort.
In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has
increased significantly since initial recognition:
failure to make payments of principal or interest on their contractually due dates;
an actual or expected significant deterioration in a financial instrument’s external or internal credit
rating (if available);
an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor; and
existing or forecast changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment that have a
significant adverse effect on the debtor’s ability to meet its obligation to the Group.
Depending on the nature of the financial instruments, the assessment of a significant increase in credit
risk is performed on either an individual basis or a collective basis. When the assessment is performed
on a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics,
such as past-due status and credit risk ratings.
ECLs are remeasured at each reporting date to reflect changes in the financial instrument’s credit risk
since initial recognition. Any change in the ECL amount is recognized as an impairment gain or loss in
profit or loss.
The Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding
adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.
Impairment and write-off policy
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset is credit-impaired. A financial asset
is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash
flows of the financial asset have occurred.
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable events:
significant financial difficulties of the debtor;
a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;
is becoming probable that the borrower will enter into bankruptcy or other financial reorganization;
significant changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment that have an adverse
effect on the debtor; or
the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties of the issuer.
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that
there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the
debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the
amounts subject to the write-off.
Subsequent recoveries of an asset that was previously written off are recognized as a reversal of
impairment in profit or loss in the period in which the recovery occurs.

NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(ii) Credit losses from cryptocurrency receivables
The Group recognizes an allowance for cryptocurrency receivables using the general expected credit
losses model in manner a similar to the model and consideration used for assessing credit losses from
financial instruments discussed above. Under this model, the Group calculates the allowance for credit
losses by considering on a discounted basis, all expected shortfalls which are the difference between
the quantity of cryptocurrency due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the quantity of
cryptocurrency that the Group expects to receive, in various default scenarios for prescribed future
periods and multiplying the shortfalls by the probability of each scenario occurring. The allowance on
the financial asset is the sum of these probability-weighted outcomes.
The Group considers both internal and external, and quantitative and qualitative factors when
estimating ECL for cryptocurrency receivables such as the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the
result of the historical transactions with the counterparty, the business practice of the counterparty,
regulatory development relating to the industry, liquidity of the underlying cryptocurrency, and the
trend of the general economy.
The Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss for expected credit losses from cryptocurrency
receivables with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of cryptocurrency receivables previously written off are recognized as a reversal
of impairment in profit or loss in the period in which the recovery occurs.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the balance of cryptocurrency receivables was nil and no
cryptocurrency receivable was past due. No allowance, write-offs or recoveries were recognized against
the cryptocurrency receivables for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.
(iii) Impairment of other assets
Internal and external sources of information are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to identify
indications that the following assets may be impaired or, an impairment loss previously recognized no
longer exists or may have decreased:
property, plant and equipment;
lease right-of-use assets;
intangible assets; and
cryptocurrency other than USDC.
If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. In addition, for
cryptocurrency other than USDC, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date whether or
not there is any indication of impairment.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in
use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset. Where an asset does not generate cash inflows largely independent of
those from other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest group of assets that
generates cash inflows independently (i.e., a cash-generating unit).
The recoverable amount of cryptocurrency other than USDC is based on the fair value less costs of
disposal. The fair value of these cryptocurrencies is measured using the quoted price of the
cryptocurrencies at the time the fair value is being measured.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss if the carrying amount of an asset, or the cash-
generating unit to which it belongs, exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognized in
respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if
any) allocated to the cash-generating unit (or group of units) and then, to reduce the carrying amount of
the other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a pro-rata basis, except that the carrying value of an
asset will not be reduced below its individual fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable) or value in
use (if determinable).
Reversals of impairment losses
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favorable change in the estimates used to determine
the recoverable amount.
A reversal of an impairment loss is limited to the asset’s carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognized in prior years. Reversals of impairment losses are
credited to profit or loss in the year in which the reversals are recognized.
u. Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The timing
or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. Provisions are measured using the best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into
account risks and uncertainties associated with the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the
time value of money is considered material.
v. Segment information
Operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that
are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the
segments and to assess their performances.
An operating segment is a component of an entity:
that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including
revenues and expenses relating to the transactions with other components of the same entity);
whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess its performance; and
for which discrete financial information is available.
The chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions based on internal management
functions and assesses the Group’s business performance as one integrated business instead of by
separate business lines or geographical regions. Accordingly, the Group has only one operating
segment and therefore, no segment information is presented.
Disaggregated revenue data by geographical region in terms of the customer’s location within the
operating segment is as follows:

w. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the income attributable to equity shareholders of the
Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the income attributable to equity shareholders of
the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, after
adjusting for the effects of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
When calculating basic loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the denominator
for the period prior to the Reorganization included the number of shares issued in the Reorganization, as
if the Reorganization occurred prior to or as of January 1, 2019.

The Group is in the process of making an assessment of what the impact of these new and amended
standards and interpretations would be in the period of initial application. So far, the Group has
concluded that the adoption of these standards and interpretations is unlikely to have a significant
impact on the Group’s financial position.
3. USE OF JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Estimates and judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates
may not be equal to the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year
are discussed below.
Depreciation of mining machines
Depreciation on the Group’s mining machines is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate
costs up to residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Group reviews the useful lives
and residual values at least at each financial year-end and adjusted, if appropriate, to ensure that the method
and rates of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of realization of economic benefits from
mining machines. The Group estimates the useful lives of mining machines based on historical experience,
taking into account anticipated technological changes. If there are significant changes from previously
estimated useful lives, the amount of depreciation expenses may change.
The useful life of mining machines is changed from one year to one to two years as a result of the
review conducted in July 2021. The impact of the change in useful life is an increase in the profit before
income tax in 2021 for an amount of approximately US$12 million.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cryptocurrency accounting
The cryptocurrency market is still a new market and is highly volatile and historical prices are not
necessarily indicative of future value. A significant change in the market prices for cryptocurrencies would
have a significant impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position.
If circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of cryptocurrencies other than USDC may not be
recoverable, the assets may be considered “impaired”, and an impairment loss may be recognized in
accordance with the accounting policy for impairment of cryptocurrencies other than USDC as described in
Note 2(t).
When such a decline has occurred, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is based on the fair value less costs of disposal. Furthermore, for USDC, the carrying
balance of USDC at the date of the combined and consolidated statements of financial position is adjusted to
its fair value with changes recorded through profit or loss.
The fair value of the cryptocurrencies is measured at quoted price at the time the fair value of
cryptocurrencies is being measured, which the Group considers to be predominantly a Level 1 fair value
input under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurement of the
cryptocurrencies lent or invested and the embedded derivatives related to cryptocurrency lending
arrangements and cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management product purchases are discussed in Note 4.
Changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the amount of the assets and could result in
additional impairment charges or reversal of impairment and gain or loss from changes in fair value in future
periods.
With respect to the cryptocurrency receivables recognized for the cryptocurrency lending or wealth
management products, the Group evaluates the expected credit losses on such receivables by considering
both internal and external, quantitative and qualitative factors and utilizing the general expected credit losses
model as described in Note 2(t).
Revenue from the proprietary mining business
There is currently no specific definitive guidance in IFRS or alternative accounting frameworks for the
accounting for the revenue from the proprietary mining business. The Group’s management has exercised
significant judgment in determining appropriate accounting treatment for the recognition of revenue from the
proprietary mining business. Management has examined various factors surrounding the substance of the
Group’s operations, such as the reliability of the measurement of the cryptocurrencies received.
Income taxes
Income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect
management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. The Group is subject to income taxes in
Singapore and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining
the income tax expense.
In determining the current income tax provision, management assesses temporary differences resulting
from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are recorded in the combined and consolidated statements of financial position.
When management assesses deductible temporary differences, including those originating from tax losses
carried forward, management must assess the probability that these will be recovered through adjustments to
future taxable income. To the extent the management believes recovery is not probable, no deferred tax asset
is recognized.
Forecasting future income requires the use of a significant amount of judgment. In estimating future
income, management uses internal operating budgets and long-range planning projections. Management
develops its budgets and long-range projections based on recent results, trends and economic and industry

NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
forecasts influencing the Group’s performance. Significant changes in management’s judgment related to the
expected realizability of deductible temporary differences result in an adjustment to the associated deferred
tax asset.
The calculation of income tax expense involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex
tax laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Management recognizes tax
benefits related to uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that
such positions will be sustained on examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation,
based on the technical merits. Management adjusts liabilities for uncertain tax positions when its judgment
changes as a result of new information previously unavailable. Due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from current
estimates. Any such differences will be reflected as adjustments to income tax expenses in the periods in
which they are determined.
Share-based payments
The determination of the fair value of the Group’s ordinary shares and the share awards granted under
the 2021 Share Incentive Plan involves significant judgment and estimates. The Group determined the fair
value of the share awards using the Binomial option valuation model. Estimates such as stock price,
volatility of the Group’s ordinary shares, risk-free interest rate, exercise multiple and the expected dividend
yield were used in the valuation model.
The Group determined the fair value of the Group’s ordinary shares, or the stock price, used in the
determination of the fair value of the share awards, using the discounted cash flow model. Estimates such as
the Group’s stage of development, financial condition and operating results, general market conditions and
the lack of marketability of the Group’s ordinary shares were used in the valuation model.
The fair value of the Group’s ordinary shares and the share awards were determined by the Group with
the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm.
4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial risk factors
The Group is exposed to various market risks including cryptocurrency risk, interest rate risk,
investment risk and foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group has designed
and implemented various risk management strategies, discussed further below, to ensure the exposure to
these risks is consistent with its risk tolerance and business objectives.
Market risk
Cryptocurrency risk
The Group is exposed to cryptocurrency risk as it yields cryptocurrencies from certain revenue
arrangements. The Group recognizes revenue based on the spot fair value of cryptocurrencies
on the day they are earned, but the value of the cryptocurrencies is subject to change on the
date they are disposed of for fiat currency.
Cryptocurrency prices are affected by various forces including global supply and demand,
interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation and the global political and economic
conditions. The profitability of the Group is highly correlated to the current and future market
price of cryptocurrencies and a decline in the market prices for cryptocurrencies could
negatively impact the Group’s future operations. In addition, the Group may not be able to
liquidate its holdings of cryptocurrencies at its desired price if required, or, in extreme market
conditions, the Group may not be able to liquidate its holdings of cryptocurrencies at all.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cryptocurrencies have a limited history, and the fair value of cryptocurrencies has been very
volatile. The historical performance of cryptocurrencies is not indicative of their future price
performance. The Group’s cryptocurrencies currently primarily consist of bitcoin. The Group
currently does not use any derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to cryptocurrency risk,
but management closely monitors the impact of the mainstream cryptocurrency exchange
market on the change of exchange rates from cryptocurrency to fiat currency. The Group limits
its exposure to the cryptocurrency risk by including in its operation strategy to dispose of the
cryptocurrencies for fiat currency shortly after they are earned.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily attributable to bank deposits, restricted cash and
borrowings. Bank deposits, restricted cash and borrowings at variable rates and fixed rates
expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk respectively.
Management closely monitors the fluctuation of such rates periodically.
Investment risk
The Group is exposed to investment risk from investment transactions such as the purchase of
cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products. These products are not principal-
guaranteed, and the Group may suffer material loss from such investments. The Group
monitors its investments closely and limits its exposure to the investment risk by including in
its operation strategy the requirements to invest only in robust wealth management products
and the investments need to be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as it conducts transactions which give rise to
payables and cash balances that are denominated in foreign currencies and the fair value or
future cash flows of the Group’s financial instrument may fluctuate due to movement in
foreign exchange rates of these foreign currencies. The volatility of exchange rates depends
on many factors that the Group is not able to accurately forecast. Management is closely
monitoring the Group’s exposure to currency risk and seeks to minimize its exposure to such
risk. The Group was not exposed to material foreign currency risk during the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting
in a financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises mainly from cash deposited in the banks,
cryptocurrencies held in custody, cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-
denoted wealth management product purchases.
To manage risk arising from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, the Group only transacts
with reputable financial institutions. There has been no recent history of default in relation to these
financial institutions.
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, substantially all of the Group’s
cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets held in the custody of Matrix Finance and Technologies
Holding Company (“Matrixport Group”), a related party. To limit exposure to credit risk relating to
cryptocurrencies under custody, the Group evaluates the system security design of the custody
service provider and regularly reviews the exposure of cryptocurrencies held in custody. The
Group has further implemented internal controls to ensure the appropriate access to the
cryptocurrencies under custody and adopted the operating strategy of disposing of the
cryptocurrency for fiat currency shortly after they are earned. The Group expects that there is no
significant credit risk from non-performance by Matrixport Group.

NOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
However, bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been, and may in the future
be, subject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities. A successful security
breach or cyberattack could result in a partial or total loss of the Group’s cryptocurrencies and
such a loss could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition and results of
operations.
The Group also has credit exposure to cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-
denoted wealth management product purchases. The Group assesses such credit risk both at
contract inception and each quarter or in shorter interval by considering the past collection
experience and any indications that the corresponding amount may not be fully collected. To
manage such exposure, the Group continuously monitors the relevant factors, such as the liquidity
of the underlying cryptocurrencies, negative report related to the counterparty, and deals only with
creditworthy counterparties and includes in its operation strategy that the lending needs to be
collected, and the wealth management products need to be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter.
Currently, the Group only conducts such transactions with the Matrixport Group. The Group had
never experienced credit losses and has no existing exposures to such credit risk as of each end
date of the combined and consolidated statement of financial position. Consequently, credit
exposure to these transactions is not considered material.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises in situations where the Group has difficulties in fulfilling financial liabilities
when they become due.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash in order to meet the Group’s
financial obligations. The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring cash flow generated from
operations and available borrowing capacity, and by managing the maturity profiles of its long-term
loans.
The following is the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual
undiscounted payments:

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders
To support the Group’s stability and growth
To provide capital for the purpose of strengthening the Group’s risk management capability
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group reviews and manages its capital structure
actively and regularly to ensure optimal capital structure and shareholder returns, taking into account the
future capital requirements of the Group and capital efficiency, prevailing and projected profitability,
projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment
opportunities.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair values are estimated at a specific point
in time, by discounting expected cash flows at rates for assets and liabilities of the same remaining maturities
and conditions. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment,
and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the
estimates.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments by valuation techniques:
Level 1 valuation: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the
measurement date.
Level 2 valuation: inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 valuation: fair value measured using significant unobservable inputs.
The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, substantially all of the Group’s financial assets and financial
liabilities are carried at amortized costs and the carrying amounts approximate their fair values. USDC is
measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the fair value of the
cryptocurrencies lent or invested is measured on a recurring basis at quoted price at the time the fair value of
the underlying cryptocurrencies is being measured, which the Group considers to be a Level 1 fair value
input. The fair value of the embedded derivative relating to the wealth management product is measured on a
recurring basis by taking the net asset value provided by the counterparty, which the Group considers to be
a Level 2 fair value input.

The Group’s restricted cash primarily relates to the application of standby letters of credit. The Group
has applied a total of three standby letters of credits (“SLCs”) from the Signature Bank and CTBC Bank
associated with property leased and electricity service subscribed. The SLCs provide the beneficiaries,
which are the service providers, the ability to draw from the banks for a designated maximum aggregate
amount (the “Draw Amount”). The details of SLCs are as follows:

which generally have an initial lease term between two to seven years. Lease contracts are typically made for
fixed periods but may have extension options. The Group accounts for lease and non-lease components
separately, where the non-lease component is charged to expenses as they incur. Any extension options in
these leases have not been included in the lease liabilities unless the Group is reasonably certain to exercise
the extension option. In addition, periods after termination options are only included in the lease term if the
lease is reasonably certain not to be terminated. The Group does not have an option to purchase these
leased assets at the expiration of the lease periods.

The above inputs for the binomial model have been determined based on the following:
Dividend return is estimated by reference to the Group’s plan to distribute dividends in the near
future. Currently, this is estimated to be zero as the Group plans to retain all profit for corporate
expansion;
Expected volatility is estimated based on the daily close price volatility of a number of comparable
companies to the Group;
Risk-free interest rate is based on the yield to maturity of U.S. treasury bills denominated in US$ at
the option valuation date;
Exercise multiple is based on empirical research on typical share award exercise behavior.

Reserves
The Group’s reserves include the following:
Share premium, which effectively represents the share subscription amount paid over the par value
of the shares. The application of the share premium account is governed by Section 34 of the
Companies Law, Cap. 22 (Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.
Invested capital reclassified upon completion of the Reorganization.

direct and indirect subsidiaries of Bitmain and BTC, which were included in invested capital as
discussed above.
(iv) The value of the conversion option of the equity component embedded in the convertible debt.
The accumulated share-based payment expenses.
Capital management
The Group’s primary objective in terms of managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for
other stakeholders, mainly by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group’s business and financial condition are highly correlated with the market price of
cryptocurrencies. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Group’s revenue is
substantially generated from cryptocurrency-related operations. The Group has adopted various measures to
minimize the risk associated with the fluctuation in the market price of cryptocurrencies, specifically, the
Group has implemented an internal strategy requiring prompt conversation of all the cryptocurrencies
received from ordinary operations into fiat currencies.
The Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to maintain a balance
between the higher shareholder returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
16. TAXATION
The subsidiaries of the Group incorporated in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) are
not subject to tax on income or capital gain. In addition, payments of dividends by the Group to its
shareholders are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands.
The subsidiaries of the Group incorporated in other countries are subject to income tax pursuant to the
rules and regulations of their respective countries of incorporation.

Deferred tax assets charged to invested capital is due to the Group recognizing deferred tax assets
related to tax losses carried forward based on the tax losses available to the individual legal entities
within the Group during the Carve-out Period, which creates differences between the income tax benefit
or expense determined based on the operation results of the Bitdeer Business.
The Group has not recognized deductible temporary differences and a portion of the tax loss

During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, substantially all of the Group’s
cryptocurrencies were held in custody by Matrixport Group, and the Group’s disposal of cryptocurrencies, at
spot price on the date of disposal, was primarily to Matrixport Group.
In February 2021, the Group signed a loan agreement with Matrixport Group, pursuant to which the
Group agreed to grant a revolving line of credit with a maximum amount of US$20 million charged with an
annual interest of 12.5% by the Group, each tranche of credit utilized shall be repaid within 60 days. The
credit line has expired, and the loan has been fully repaid in June 2021. The Group received an interest of
approximately US$0.8 million associated with the loan.
In September 2021, the Group signed a loan agreement with Matrixport Group, pursuant to which the
Group agreed to grant a loan of 30 million USDC. The loan is non-secured, bears an annual interest of 8.25%
and is due in December 2021. The loan has been fully repaid in December 2021 and the Group received an
interest of approximately US$0.7 million associated with the loan. As of December 31, 2021, for the
cryptocurrency lending arrangement, the balance of cryptocurrency receivables was nil. The change in fair
value of the underlying cryptocurrencies lent is immaterial as the arrangement is short-term in nature and the
quoted price of USDC is relatively stable.
In October 2021, the Group purchased 30 million USDT with USD and purchased from Matrixport Group
a non-principal-guaranteed wealth management product, representing the Group’s units of interest in the
underlying cryptocurrency trading account, in the amount of 30 million USDT. The value of the units is
based on the performance of the trading account and the Group has the right to redeem the units with
Matrixport Group based on the value on the redemption date during certain days of each month. All units
were redeemed on December 28, 2021 and the USDT received from the redemption of the units were shortly
disposed of in exchange for USD. The return from the wealth management product was US$0.7 million. As of
December 31, 2021, the balances of cryptocurrency receivables and embedded derivative relating to
cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management product were both nil. The change in fair value of the
underlying cryptocurrencies invested and the embedded derivative are immaterial as the arrangement is
short-term in nature and the quoted price of USDT is relatively stable.
The purchases and disposals of cryptocurrencies associated with investment or lending transactions
are presented as investing activities in the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows.
18. EARNINGS / (LOSS) PER SHARE
The calculation of basic earnings / (loss) per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary equity
shareholders of the Group and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the year
ended December 31, 2021.
Diluted earnings / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares
and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the respective periods.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings / (loss) per
ordinary share computations:

Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under applicable Laws, and cooperate as
reasonably requested by the other parties, to consummate and implement expeditiously each of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto shall execute and deliver such other
documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and take such other actions as may be necessary or
reasonably desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously each of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
10.2 Tax Matters.

(b) PubCo, SPAC, Acquisition Entities and the Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the transactions contemplated herein to qualify for the Intended Tax
Treatment and agree not to, and not to permit or cause any Affiliate or any Subsidiary to, take any
actions or cause any action to be taken that such party reasonably expects would prevent, impair or
impede the Intended Tax Treatment (other than actions contemplated under this Agreement).
(c) SPAC, Acquisition Entities or the Company, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other party
in writing if, before the Initial Closing Date or Closing Date, as applicable, it determines that it is not
reasonable for the Initial Mergers or Acquisition Merger to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, as
applicable. Following such notice, the notifying party may propose amendments to the terms of this
Agreement that such person believes could reasonably facilitate such qualification without adversely
affecting the rights and commercial position of SPAC, Acquisition Entities, the Company, and their
respective shareholders and warrant or option holders. In that case, each other party shall consider in
good faith the proposed amendments and, if it determines in good faith that they would not result in
unreasonable delay to Initial Closing and/or Acquisition Closing and would not adversely affect the
rights or commercial position of SPAC, the Company, and their respective shareholders and warrant or
option holders, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect any such amendments.
(d) In the event that PubCo determines after Acquisition Closing that PubCo is a PFIC for any
taxable year, PubCo shall provide sufficient information to PubCo’s shareholders to make a timely

tax representation letters to each other party’s tax advisors, as applicable, in form and substance

or requires any opinion on the Intended Tax Treatment of the Initial Mergers or other tax consequences
to SPAC Shareholders, SPAC shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such opinion (as so required or
requested) to be provided by its tax advisor. If the SEC requests or requires any opinion on the
Intended Tax Treatment of the Acquisition Merger or other tax consequences to Company Shareholders,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such opinion (as so required or requested) to be
provided by its tax advisor. For the avoidance of doubt, a tax opinion regarding the Intended Tax
Treatment is not a condition to closing.
(f) For two (2) years following the Closing Date, PubCo’s “qualified group”  (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) shall use the lower of (i) fifty percent (50%) of the cash

The objective of this valuation is to provide an independent opinion on the fair market value of a 100%
non-controlling equity interest of the Bitdeer Group as at the Appraisal Date for transaction purpose. We
understand that our valuation will be used in connection to public documents in relation to the Potential
Business Combination.
The appraisal is conducted in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America and the International Valuation Standards. These standards contain guideline on
the basis and valuation approaches used.
II. BASIS OF VALUE
The valuation is performed on the basis of fair market value. The Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) defines “fair market value” as the price a willing buyer would pay a
willing seller in a transaction on the open market.
III. PREMISE OF VALUE
Our opinion of value relies on a going-concern premise. This premise assumes that the Bitdeer Group is
an ongoing business enterprise with management operating in a rational way with a goal of maximising
shareholder value.
IV. SCOPE OF WORK
This appraisal reflects facts and conditions existing at the Appraisal Date. Subsequent events have not
been considered and we are not required to update our report for such events and conditions.
Our appraisal opinion is based on the assumptions stated herein and on information provided by the
management of the Bitdeer Group (the “Management”). In the course of our valuation, we have conducted the
following processes and procedures:
Collected and analysed the relevant historical financial statements and other financial and
operational information of the Bitdeer Group from the Management;
Conducted interviews with the Management in relation to the Bitdeer Group’s history, operations,
and prospects of its business;
Researched the general economic outlook and the outlook for the specific industry affecting the
business of the Bitdeer Group, its industry and its markets;
Examined the reasonableness of the information as well as other records and documents provided
by the Management, in light of our research and analysis on the industry and economic data;
Determined the most appropriate valuation method for the valuation;
Identified the comparable companies of the Bitdeer Group;
Developed the appropriate discount rate that reflects the return of entities engaged in a similar line
of business and returns from other similar types of projects of the Bitdeer Group;
Reviewed the underlying assumptions of the financial projections of the Bitdeer Group furnished to
us by the Management (the “Projection”); and
Evaluated the business enterprise value of the Bitdeer Group based on the assumptions and
valuation methods stated in the report.

This appraisal relies upon the following contingent and limiting conditions:
Public, industry, statistical, and other information furnished by others, upon which all or portions
of this analysis is based, is believed to be reliable. However, we make no representation as to the
accuracy or completeness of such information and have performed no procedures to corroborate
the information.
The information supplied to us by the Bitdeer Group is complete and accurate to the best of their
knowledge and that the financial statement information reflects the results of operations and
financial and business condition of the Bitdeer Group in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, unless otherwise noted. The financial statements and other related
information supplied by management has been accepted as correct without further verification. We
have not audited, reviewed, or compiled the financial information provided to us and, accordingly,
we express no audit opinion or any other form of assurance on this information. We also have no
reason to believe that any material facts have been withheld from us.
This report is to be used for the specific purposes stated herein and any other use is invalid. No
one should rely on our report as a substitute for their own due diligence. No reference to our name
or our report, in whole or in part, in any document to be prepared or distributed to third parties may
be made without our written consent and approval.
The opinion of value is valid only for the stated purpose as of the valuation date indicated. We
take no responsibility for changes in market conditions and assume no obligation to revise our
conclusion of value to reflect events or conditions which occur subsequent to the valuation date.
For the prospective financial information approved by management that is used in our engagement,
we have not examined or compiled the prospective financial information and therefore, do not
express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance on the prospective financial information or
the related assumptions. Events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected and there
will usually be differences between prospective financial information and actual results, and those
differences may be material.
In arriving at our opinion of value, we have relied to a very considerable extent on the above-
mentioned information. Any variation to the assumptions in the valuation could seriously affect
our opinion of value.

As of 30 June 2021, the designed power supply in use and under construction were approximately
203MW and approximately 782MW, respectively while the power supply in pipeline was approximately
358MW. The total designed power supply of 1,343MW is expected to be fully in use by end of 2024.
As at the Appraisal Date, the theoretical hash rate of the Bitdeer Group was approximately 4.38EH/s.
Due to certain delay in the relocation of its mining machines and the construction of the datacenters in
Rockdale, the actual average available hash rate of the Bitdeer Group in September 2021 was approximately
2.6EH/s. It is expected that the available hash rate of the Bitdeer Group would resume to the normal level, i.e.,
90% or 95% of the theoretical hash rate, by end of 2021.",540,541

Selection of Valuation Methods
In this valuation, we have considered the three generally recognised valuation approaches, namely cost
approach, income approach, and market approach and. The approach or approaches deemed most relevant
will then be selected for use.
Cost Approach
The cost approach provides an indication of value using the economic principle that a buyer will pay no
more for an asset than the cost to obtain an asset of equal utility, whether by purchase or by construction,
unless undue time, inconvenience, risk or other factors are involved. The approach provides an indication of
value by calculating the current replacement or reproduction cost of an asset and making deductions for
physical deterioration and all other relevant forms of obsolescence.
Market Approach
The market approach provides an indication of value by comparing the asset with identical or
comparable (that is similar) assets for which price information is available. Third-party transactions in the
equity of an enterprise generally represent the best estimate of fair market value if they are done at arm’s
length.
Income Approach
The income approach provides an indication of value by converting future cash flow to a single current
value. Under the income approach, the value of an asset/the business entity is determined by reference to
the value of income, cash flow or cost savings generated by the asset/ the business entity. A fundamental
basis for the income approach is that investors expect to receive a return on their investments and that such
a return should reflect the perceived level of risk in the investment
Valuation Method Adopted
The valuation approach is determined based on professional judgment and technical expertise after
detailed analysis on facts and circumstances. Key factors we have considered include, among other criteria,
business nature and stage of development of the subject entity, the quantity and quality of the information
provided, access to available data, supply of relevant market transactions, type and nature of the subject
asset, purpose and objective of the valuation.
Under the cost approach, the fair market value of equity interest is determined based on the replacement
costs or reproduction costs of assets rather than the ability to generate streams of benefits in the future.
The value of a service company like the Bitdeer Group is more driven by the future earnings to be
generated than the value of its assets. The Bitdeer Group has established its own brand, its customer base
and its business networks. These are the intangible assets that exist in the business but not capitalized.
Thus, the relationship between the fair market value and the book costs is weak for the Bitdeer Group.
Therefore, the cost approach has been disclaimed.
Under the market approach, there are two primary methods. The first, often referred to as the
Comparable Transactions Method, involves determining valuation multiples from sales of enterprises with",541,541

similar financial and operating characteristics and applying those multiples to the subject enterprise. The
second, often referred to as the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, involves identifying and
selecting publicly-traded enterprises with financial and operating characteristics similar to the enterprise
being valued.

Research from Internet
Core Scientific announced that it was going public through a SPAC merger with Power & Digital
Infrastructure Acquisition Corp. (XPDI.US) in a deal valuing the group at US$4,300 million on 21 July
2021. The deal has not yet completed as of the Appraisal Date.
Shares of Stronghold Digital Mining was listed on 20 October 2021. The market capitalisation as at 20
October 2021 was approximately US$1,308 million.
There are limited historical and forecast operational and financial information available on these newly
listed / acquired entities. Thus, the Comparable Transactions Method is not selected.
On the other hand, shares of several major market players in Bitcoin mining sector have been listed.
Different value measures or market multiples of the comparable companies are calculated and analysed to
induce a series of multiples that are considered representative of the industry average. Once publicly traded
enterprises are identified, valuation multiples can be derived, adjusted for comparability, and then applied to
the subject enterprise to estimate the value of its equity or enterprise value. The Guideline Publicly-traded
Comparable Method generally yields valuation information at the non-controlling, marketable level of value.
Thus, it has been selected as the principal valuation method for this valuation.
In recent years, the business scale of mining companies has gradually expanded, and the services they
provide have also moved towards standardization, resulting in the scale effect. The Management has
prepared the Projection based on the historical financial and operating data and the latest business plan of
the Bitdeer Group. Therefore, the business enterprise value can be estimated based on forecasts of
fundamental conditions in the future rather than current data using the discounted cash flow analysis under
the income approach.
However, the discounted cash flow analysis relies on explicit financial forecasts which require many
assumptions, including but not limiting to the forecasted Bitcoin price, the future total Bitcoin network hash
rate, the size of transactions, the future transaction fees, the pace of market acceptance of cryptocurrency,
the availability of mining rigs and mining farms, the stability of electricity supply, etc. Thus, the discounted
cash flow analysis has only been engaged as a secondary approach to cross-check the valuation result
derived from the market approach.
Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method
In the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, the fair market value is based on prices at which
stocks of similar companies are trading in a public market. A “value measure” is usually a multiple computed
by dividing the price of the guideline company’s stock as at the valuation date by some relevant economic
variable observed or calculated from the guideline company’s financial statements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Selection of Comparable Companies
A major requirement in applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method is to identify
companies that are comparable to the subject company in terms of business nature and associated risks. We
have selected comparable companies we think fit for this valuation primarily based on the following criteria:
(1) principally engaged in similar business (i.e., Bitcoin mining); (2) listed on a reputable capital market for
not less than 12 months from the Appraisal Date; (3) with disclosure on their key performance and financial
metrics such as hash rate, earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”); and
(4) being / expected to be have operating profits in 2021.
Based on the above criteria, we have preliminary identified seven entities which are considered as
closely comparative to the Bitdeer Group and they are listed in the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom. However, after our further analysis, only five entities are selected as the comparable companies of
the Bitdeer Group (the “Comparable Companies”).
The Comparable Companies are considered as highly but not perfectly comparable with the Bitdeer
Group in terms of capital structure, operating scale, product mix and business performance metrics. The
Comparable Companies are major market players and have a majority of contributed by Bitcoin mining
operations. The inclusion of 5 comparable companies also accommodates the fact of not perfectly
comparable business. As such, the below list of the Comparable Companies is considered as fair and
representative for the purpose of this valuation. A description of their business operation is summarized
below:

Research from internet
There are two public companies that have bene shortlisted but finally rejected as comparable
companies, namely Bit Digital, Inc. and Bitfarms Ltd. Because their publicly available financial information is
considered as not sufficient for this valuation, they are excluded from the Comparable Companies.
Bit Digital, Inc. operates as a Bitcoin mining company, focuses on its mining business located globally
in Asia, Canada, and the United States. Bitfarms Ltd. operates as a cryptocurrency mining firm which
provides computing power to cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin, earning fees from each network for
securing and processing transactions and serves customers in Quebec. The market capitalisation of Bit
Digital, Inc. and Bitfarms Ltd as at the Appraisal Date were US$397.6 million and US$742.8 million,
respectively.
Market Multiple
In applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, different value measures or market
multiples of the comparable companies are calculated and analysed to induce a series of multiples that are
considered representative of the industry average. Then, we applied the relevant industry multiples to the
subject company to determine a value for the subject company that is on a freely-traded basis.
We have applied the market value of enterprise value (“E
V”) multiple in this valuation. EV equals to the
sum of (1) market capitalisation; (2) value of total debt; (3) value of preferred equity and non-controlling
interest and less (4) value of cash and cash equivalents. EV is the value of a company’s core business
operations that is available to all shareholders (debt, equity, preferred, etc.).
Hash rate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining. More simply, it is the
speed of mining. It is measured in units of hash/second, meaning how many calculations per second can be
performed. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and can process a lot of data in a single
second. In the case of Bitcoin, the hash rate indicates the number of times hash values are calculated for
PoW every second. Thus, hash rate is considered as one of the relevant economic multiples for this
valuation.
In recent years, the prices of Bitcoins have fluctuated greatly. The Bitcoin price has soared by 216%
from the last peak on December 17 in 2017 at US$20,089 to US$63,554 on April 14, 2021. As at the Appraisal
Date, it was valued at US$41,538. The Bitcoin price is generally expected to be on an upward trend, despite
the Bitcoin halving event in early 2024. The promising price of Bitcoin boost the mining revenue and the
profitability of mining companies and miners, leading to the gradual business expansion in scale of mining
companies. This implies that the pure historical financial information cannot fairly reflect the full picture in
near future, as such the forecasted figures for the year ended 31 December 2021 are adopted.
For profitability, it can be measured by EBITDA which is capital structure-neutral nature. EBITDA is
also useful for transnational comparisons because it ignores the distorting effects of individual countries
taxation policies.

for this appraisal.
Based on the available market figures sourced from Bloomberg, we have arrived at the following ratios

Because the computational power capacity of the Bitdeer Group is higher than that of the Comparable
Companies, the third quartile of the value ratios of the Comparable Companies are selected and considered
as reasonable for this valuation. The following value ratios applied for this valuation are summarised as
follows:

The indicated EV of the Bitdeer Group is the weighted average of the product of the selected ratios of
the Comparable Companies generated and its relevant financial and operational information while equal
weighting is assigned in this valuation. To derive the fair market value of the entire equity interest, the net
debts and non-operating assets and liabilities are first deducted from the indicated EV and finally, the result
is subject to a discount for lack of marketability adjustment in order to derive the fair market value of the
non-controlling, non-marketable equity interest in the Bitdeer Group.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
A discounted cash flow analysis involves forecasting the appropriate cash flow stream over an
appropriate period and then discounting it back to a present value at an appropriate discount rate. This
discount rate should consider the time value of money, inflation, and the risk inherent in ownership of the
asset or security interest being valued.
Performing a discounted cash flow analysis requires the preparation and analysis of a reliable forecast
of the expected future financial performance of the subject entity. Forecasting cash flow to all investors
requires the projection of revenues, operating expenses, taxes, working capital requirements, and capital
expenditures for a future period.
Projected cash flow to all investors must then be discounted to a present value using a discount rate,
which appropriately accounts for the market cost of capital as well as the risk and nature of the subject cash
flows. Finally, an assumption must be made regarding the sustainable long-term rate of earnings growth at
the end of the projection period, and a terminal or residual value of the remaining cash flows must be
estimated and discounted to a present value. The sum of the present values of the projected cash flows and
the terminal value equals the value of the enterprise.
Cash Flow Adjustments
Because we attempted to arrive at free cash flow to equity in our valuation model, net income had to be
adjusted for certain items in order to estimate the cash return on the assets that generate the forecast
revenue. First, noncash items, including depreciation and amortisation expenses, if any, were added back to
net income. Second, forecasted capital expenditures, if any, and investment in operating working capital were
subtracted. Working capital requirements were forecast across the entire projection period by analysing
growth in operating expenses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discount Rate Estimation
The discount rate applied to the forecasted cash flows and terminal value must adequately reflect the
nature of the subject investment and the risk of the underlying cash flows. For purposes of our analysis, the
appropriate discount rate is a cost of equity. The cost of equity is developed through the application of the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”) with reference to the required rates of return demanded by investors
for similar projects.
CAPM
The CAPM states that an investor requires excess returns to compensate for any risk that is correlated
to the risk in the return from the stock market as a whole but requires no excess return for other risks. Risks
that are correlated to the risk in the return from the stock market as a whole are referred to as systematic and
measured by a parameter called beta, whereas other risks are referred to as non-systematic.
The cost of equity for the Bitdeer Group is the sum of the risk-free rate return, the equity risk premium
required by investors to compensate for the systematic risk assumed with adjustments for increment for risk
differentials of versus those of the comparable companies, which include risk adjustments for size and other
risk factors in relation to the comparable companies. The formula of CAPM is defined as follows:
Re = Rf + β(Rm) + Rc
where:
= Cost of equity
= Risk-free rate
= Beta
= Market risk premium
= Premium for size and other risk factors
A risk-free rate is based upon the average yields on long-term government bonds in the United States
and Singapore as of the Appraisal Date. A market risk premium represents the average total return of common
stocks in excess of the income return of long-term securities in the United States and Singapore. In order to
estimate the appropriate beta for use in our analysis, we have researched companies in a similar business as
the Bitdeer Group and selected our list of comparable companies (i.e., the Comparable Companies). We have
derived the unlevered betas from the equity levered betas of the Comparable Companies as at the Appraisal
Date by adjusting their respective debt-to-equity ratio and their statutory/effective tax rate. We then apply
the debt-to-equity ratio of the comparable companies and the statutory tax rate of the Bitdeer Group to
develop the re-levered betas of the comparable companies. The average re-levered beta of the comparable
companies is adopted as the proxy and then applied to the CAPM formula. A small capitalisation risk
premium and a company specific risk premium are then added to the calculation of the cost of equity.
Small capitalisation risk premium is the excess return that an investor would demand in order to
compensate for the additional risk over that of the entire stock market when investing in a small capitalization
company. This premium reflects the fact that cost of capital increases with decreasing size of a company. A
number of studies were conducted in the U.S. which concludes that the risk premium associated with a small
company is over and above the amount that would be warranted just as a result of the company’s systematic
risk derived from the CAPM.
According to our analysis, the cost of equity of the Bitdeer Group as at the Appraisal Date was 25.0%. It
is considered as reasonable because the relative short history and the great uncertainty in the future
development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies lead to higher discount rates, as compared to other traditional
businesses.
Terminal Value Calculation
The terminal value is based on a terminal value cash flow multiple and such multiple is calculated by
subtracting the terminal growth rate from the cost of equity and taking the inverse, which equals the
capitalisation rate of the Bitdeer Group. The terminal growth rate is determined based upon the long-term

industry growth expectations and the forecasted long-term inflation rates in the United States and Singapore.
The capitalisation rate is applied to the growth-adjusted terminal year cash flow to determine terminal value.
Discount for Lack of Marketability
The concept of marketability deals with the liquidity of an ownership interest, that is, how quickly and
easily it can be converted to cash if the owner chooses to sell. The discount for lack of marketability reflects
the fact that there is no ready market for shares in a closely held corporation. Ownership interests in closely
held companies are typically not readily marketable compared to similar interests in public companies.
Therefore, a share of stock in a privately held company is usually worth less than an otherwise comparable
share in a publicly held company.
Based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, a 12.5% discount is suggested for this valuation.
The discount is mainly calculated with the Finnerty model, which is one of the common quantitative methods
in assessing the discount for lack of marketability for the shares of private entity, like the Bitdeer Group. This
conclusion is also concurred with our findings on other relevant research papers (both formal and informal)
and valuation journals on valuation premiums and discounts which are publicly available.

XII. OPINION OF VALUE
Based upon the investigation and analysis outlined above and the appraisal method employed, it is our
opinion that the fair market value of the 100% non-controlling equity interest in the Bitdeer Group as at 30
September 2021 is reasonably stated by the amount of US DOLLARS FOUR BILLION FIVE HUNDRED AND
THIRTY-NINE MILLION ONLY (US$4,539,000,000).
This opinion of value is based on generally accepted valuation procedures and practices that rely
extensively on the use of numerous assumptions and the consideration of many uncertainties, not all of
which can be easily quantified or ascertained. Any variation to the assumptions and limiting conditions
presented in the following report could seriously affect our opinion of value.
Although our valuation is intended to estimate fair market value, we assume no responsibility for the
inability of a seller or buyer to obtain a sale or purchase contract at that price.
We have no obligation to update this report or our opinion of value for information that comes to our
attention after the date of this report.

We have been instructed by Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (the “Company” or “BSGA”) to perform
an appraisal of the fair market value of a 100% non-controlling equity interest in the business enterprise of
Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company (“Bitdeer” and together with its subsidiaries as the “Bitdeer Group”)
as at 13 December 2021 (the “Appraisal Date”) for transaction purpose.
The Bitdeer Group is principally engaged in provision of digital asset mining services and with a focus
on Bitcoin. Its major business segments are: proprietary mining, cloud hash rate sharing and cloud hosting.
Headquartered in Singapore, Bitdeer currently operates five proprietary mining datacenters in the United
States (i.e., Pangborn in Washington, Rockdale in Texas, and Knoxville in Tennessee) and Norway (i.e.,
Molde and Tydal).
BSGA has entered into a merger agreement which provides for a business combination between BSGA
and Bitdeer.
In this appraisal, fair market value is defined as the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in a
transaction on the open market.
The fair market value of the equity interest in the Bitdeer Group is principally derived by the application
of the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method under market approach. Our opinion of value relies on a
going-concern premise. This premise assumes that the Bitdeer Group is an ongoing business enterprise with
management operating in a rational way with a goal of maximising shareholder value.

Selection of Valuation Methods
In this valuation, we have considered the three generally recognised valuation approaches, namely cost
approach, income approach, and market approach and. The approach or approaches deemed most relevant
will then be selected for use.
Cost Approach
The cost approach provides an indication of value using the economic principle that a buyer will pay no
more for an asset than the cost to obtain an asset of equal utility, whether by purchase or by construction,
unless undue time, inconvenience, risk or other factors are involved. The approach provides an indication of
value by calculating the current replacement or reproduction cost of an asset and making deductions for
physical deterioration and all other relevant forms of obsolescence.
Market Approach
The market approach provides an indication of value by comparing the asset with identical or
comparable (that is similar) assets for which price information is available. Third-party transactions in the
equity of an enterprise generally represent the best estimate of fair market value if they are done at arm’s
length.
Income Approach
The income approach provides an indication of value by converting future cash flow to a single current
value. Under the income approach, the value of an asset/the business entity is determined by reference to
the value of income, cash flow or cost savings generated by the asset/ the business entity. A fundamental
basis for the income approach is that investors expect to receive a return on their investments and that such
a return should reflect the perceived level of risk in the investment
Valuation Method Adopted
The valuation approach is determined based on professional judgment and technical expertise after
detailed analysis on facts and circumstances. Key factors we have considered include, among other criteria,
business nature and stage of development of the subject entity, the quantity and quality of the information
provided, access to available data, supply of relevant market transactions, type and nature of the subject
asset, purpose and objective of the valuation.
Under the cost approach, the fair market value of equity interest is determined based on the replacement
costs or reproduction costs of assets rather than the ability to generate streams of benefits in the future.
The value of a service company like the Bitdeer Group is more driven by the future earnings to be
generated than the value of its assets. The Bitdeer Group has established its own brand, its customer base
and its business networks. These are the intangible assets that exist in the business but not capitalized.
Thus, the relationship between the fair market value and the book costs is weak for the Bitdeer Group.
Therefore, the cost approach has been disclaimed.
Under the market approach, there are two primary methods. The first, often referred to as the
Comparable Transactions Method, involves determining valuation multiples from sales of enterprises with
similar financial and operating characteristics and applying those multiples to the subject enterprise. The
second, often referred to as the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, involves identifying and
selecting publicly-traded enterprises with financial and operating characteristics similar to the enterprise
being valued.
According to our research, there were some merger and acquisition transactions regarding digital assets
mining companies taken place in the recent two years, such as Cipher Mining Inc. (stock ticker: CIFR.US),
Core Scientific Holding Company Ltd. (stock ticker: XPDI.US); Greenidge (stock ticker: GREE.US), Mawson
Infrastructure Group Inc (stock ticker: MIGI.US) and Stronghold Digital Mining (stock ticker:
D-2-4 TABLE OF CONTENTS
SDIG.US). However, there are limited historical and forecast operational and financial information available
on these newly listed / acquired entities. Thus, the Comparable Transactions Method is not selected.
On the other hand, shares of several major market players in Bitcoin mining sector have been listed.
Different value measures or market multiples of the comparable companies are calculated and analysed to
induce a series of multiples that are considered representative of the industry average. Once publicly traded
enterprises are identified, valuation multiples can be derived, adjusted for comparability, and then applied to
the subject enterprise to estimate the value of its equity or enterprise value. The Guideline Publicly-traded
Comparable Method generally yields valuation information at the non-controlling, marketable level of value.
Thus, it has been selected as the principal valuation method for this valuation.
In recent years, the business scale of mining companies has gradually expanded, and the services they
provide have also moved towards standardization, resulting in the scale effect. The Management has
prepared the Projection based on the historical financial and operating data and the latest business plan of
the Bitdeer Group. Therefore, the business enterprise value can be estimated based on forecasts of
fundamental conditions in the future rather than current data using the discounted cash flow analysis under
the income approach.
However, the discounted cash flow analysis relies on explicit financial forecasts which require many
assumptions, including but not limiting to the forecasted Bitcoin price, the future total Bitcoin network hash
rates, the size of transactions, the future transaction fees, the pace of market acceptance of cryptocurrency,
the availability of mining rigs and mining farms, the stability of electricity supply, etc. Thus, the discounted
cash flow is not selected in this valuation.
Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method
In the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, the fair market value is based on prices at which
stocks of similar companies are trading in a public market. A “value measure” is usually a multiple computed
by dividing the price of the guideline company’s stock as at the valuation date by some relevant economic
variable observed or calculated from the guideline company’s financial statements.
Selection of Comparable Companies
A major requirement in applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method is to identify
companies that are comparable to the subject company in terms of business nature and associated risks. We
have selected comparable companies we think fit for this valuation primarily based on the following criteria:
(1) principally engaged in similar business (i.e., Bitcoin mining); (2) listed on a reputable capital market for
not less than 12 months from the Appraisal Date; (3) with disclosure on their key performance and financial
metrics such as hash rate, earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”); and
(4) being / expected to be have operating profits in 2021.
There are five entities which are considered as closely comparative to the Bitdeer Group (the
“Comparable Companies”) and they are listed in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom for this
valuation.
The Comparable Companies are considered as highly but not perfectly comparable with the Bitdeer
Group in terms of capital structure, operating scale, product mix and business performance metrics. The
Comparable Companies are major market players and have a majority of contributed by Bitcoin mining
operations. The inclusion of five comparable companies also accommodates the fact of not perfectly
comparable business. As such, the below list of the Comparable Companies is considered as fair and
representative for the purpose of this valuation. A description of their business operation is summarized
below:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
We have applied the market value of enterprise value (“E
V”) multiple in this valuation. EV equals to the
sum of (1) market capitalisation; (2) value of total debt; (3) value of preferred equity and non-controlling
interest and less (4) value of cash and cash equivalents. EV is the value of a company’s core business
operations that is available to all shareholders (debt, equity, preferred, etc.).
Hash rate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining. More simply, it is the
speed of mining. It is measured in units of hash/second, meaning how many calculations per second can be
performed. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and can process a lot of data in a single
second. In the case of Bitcoin, the hash rate indicates the number of times hash values are calculated for
PoW every second. Thus, hash rate is considered as one of the relevant economic multiples for this
valuation.
In recent years, the prices of Bitcoins have fluctuated greatly. The Bitcoin price has soared by 216%
from the last peak on December 17 in 2017 at US$20,089 to US$63,554 on April 14, 2021. As at the Appraisal
Date, it was valued at US$46,829. The Bitcoin price is generally expected to be on an upward trend, despite
the Bitcoin halving event in early 2024. The promising price of Bitcoin boost the mining revenue and the
profitability of mining companies and miners, leading to the gradual business expansion in scale of mining
companies. This implies that the pure historical financial information cannot fairly reflect the full picture in
near future, as such the forecasted figures for the year ended 31 December 2021 are adopted.
For profitability, it can be measured by EBITDA which is capital structure-neutral nature. EBITDA is
also useful for transnational comparisons because it ignores the distorting effects of individual countries
taxation policies.
Specifically, we have applied the multiples of (1) EV-to-Forecasted Revenue for 2021; (2) EV-to-
Forecasted EBITDA for 2021; and (3) EV-to-Hash rate as at the Appraisal Date; of the Comparable Companies
for this appraisal.
Based on the available market figures sourced from Bloomberg, we have arrived at the following ratios
of the Comparable Companies:

Because the computational power capacity of the Bitdeer Group is higher than that of the Comparable
Companies, the third quartile of the value ratios of the Comparable Companies are selected and considered
as reasonable for this valuation. The following value ratios applied for this valuation are summarised as
follows:

The indicated EV of the Bitdeer Group is the weighted average of the product of the selected ratios of
the Comparable Companies generated and its relevant financial and operational information while equal
weighting is assigned in this valuation. To derive the fair market value of the entire equity interest, the net
debts and non-operating assets and liabilities are first deducted from the indicated EV and finally, the result
is subject to a discount for lack of marketability adjustment in order to derive the fair market value of the
non-controlling, non-marketable equity interest in the Bitdeer Group.
Discount for Lack of Marketability
The concept of marketability deals with the liquidity of an ownership interest, that is, how quickly and
easily it can be converted to cash if the owner chooses to sell. The discount for lack of marketability reflects
the fact that there is no ready market for shares in a closely held corporation. Ownership interests in closely
held companies are typically not readily marketable compared to similar interests in public companies.

Therefore, a share of stock in a privately held company is usually worth less than an otherwise comparable
share in a publicly held company.
Based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, a 13.0% discount is suggested for this valuation.
The discount is mainly calculated with the Finnerty model, which is one of the common quantitative methods
in assessing the discount for lack of marketability for the shares of private entity, like the Bitdeer Group. This
conclusion is also concurred with our findings on other relevant research papers (both formal and informal)
and valuation journals on valuation premiums and discounts which are publicly available.",559,559

Based upon the investigation and analysis outlined above and the appraisal method employed, it is our
opinion that the fair market value of the 100% non-controlling equity interest in the Bitdeer Group as at 13
December 2021 is reasonably stated by the amount of US DOLLARS FOUR BILLION SIX HUNDRED AND
THIRTEEN MILLION ONLY (US$4,613,000,000).
This opinion of value is based on generally accepted valuation procedures and practices that rely
extensively on the use of numerous assumptions and the consideration of many uncertainties, not all of
which can be easily quantified or ascertained. Any variation to the assumptions and limiting conditions
presented in the following report could seriously affect our opinion of value.
Although our valuation is intended to estimate fair market value, we assume no responsibility for the
inability of a seller or buyer to obtain a sale or purchase contract at that price.
We have no obligation to update this report or our opinion of value for information that comes to our
attention after the date of this report.
We hereby confirm that we are independent of and not connected with the Bitdeer Group and BSGA,
and have neither present nor prospective interests in them, or the values reported.

Dear Sir or Madam,
RE: VALUATION OF BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
We have been instructed by Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (the “Company” or “BSGA”) to perform
an appraisal of the fair market value of a 100% non-controlling equity interest in the business enterprise of
Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company (“Bitdeer” and together with its subsidiaries as the “Bitdeer Group”)
as at 17 February 2023 (the “Appraisal Date”) for transaction purpose.
The Bitdeer Group is principally engaged in provision of digital asset mining services and with a focus
on Bitcoin. Its major business segments are: proprietary mining, hashrate sharing and hosting.
BSGA has entered into a merger agreement which provides for a business combination between BSGA
and Bitdeer.
In this appraisal, fair market value is defined as the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in a
transaction on the open market.
The fair market value of the equity interest in the Bitdeer Group is principally derived by the application
of the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method under market approach. Our opinion of value relies on a
going-concern premise. This premise assumes that the Bitdeer Group is an ongoing business enterprise with
management operating in a rational way with a goal of maximising shareholder value.

IX. VALUATION METHODOLOGY
Selection of Valuation Methods
In this valuation, we have considered the three generally recognised valuation approaches, namely cost
approach, income approach, and market approach and. The approach or approaches deemed most relevant
will then be selected for use.
Cost Approach
The cost approach provides an indication of value using the economic principle that a buyer will pay no
more for an asset than the cost to obtain an asset of equal utility, whether by purchase or by construction,
unless undue time, inconvenience, risk or other factors are involved. The approach provides an indication of
value by calculating the current replacement or reproduction cost of an asset and making deductions for
physical deterioration and all other relevant forms of obsolescence.
Market Approach
The market approach provides an indication of value by comparing the asset with identical or
comparable (that is similar) assets for which price information is available. Third-party transactions in the
equity of an enterprise generally represent the best estimate of fair market value if they are done at arm’s
length.
Income Approach
The income approach provides an indication of value by converting future cash flow to a single current
value. Under the income approach, the value of an asset/the business entity is determined by reference to
the value of income, cash flow or cost savings generated by the asset/ the business entity. A fundamental
basis for the income approach is that investors expect to receive a return on their investments and that such
a return should reflect the perceived level of risk in the investment
Valuation Method Adopted
The valuation approach is determined based on professional judgment and technical expertise after
detailed analysis on facts and circumstances. Key factors we have considered include, among other criteria,
business nature and stage of development of the subject entity, the quantity and quality of the information
provided, access to available data, supply of relevant market transactions, type and nature of the subject
asset, purpose and objective of the valuation.
Under the cost approach, the fair market value of equity interest is determined based on the replacement
costs or reproduction costs of assets rather than the ability to generate streams of benefits in the future.
The value of the Bitdeer Group is more driven by the future earnings to be generated than the value of
its assets. The Bitdeer Group has established its own brand, its customer base and its business networks.
These are the intangible assets that exist in the business but not capitalized. Thus, the relationship between
the fair market value and the book costs is weak for the Bitdeer Group. Therefore, the cost approach has
been disclaimed.
Under the market approach, there are two primary methods. The first, often referred to as the
Comparable Transactions Method, involves determining valuation multiples from sales of enterprises with
similar financial and operating characteristics and applying those multiples to the subject enterprise. The

Selection of Valuation Methods
In this valuation, we have considered the three generally recognised valuation approaches, namely cost
approach, income approach, and market approach and. The approach or approaches deemed most relevant
will then be selected for use.
Cost Approach
The cost approach provides an indication of value using the economic principle that a buyer will pay no
more for an asset than the cost to obtain an asset of equal utility, whether by purchase or by construction,
unless undue time, inconvenience, risk or other factors are involved. The approach provides an indication of
value by calculating the current replacement or reproduction cost of an asset and making deductions for
physical deterioration and all other relevant forms of obsolescence.
Market Approach
The market approach provides an indication of value by comparing the asset with identical or
comparable (that is similar) assets for which price information is available. Third-party transactions in the
equity of an enterprise generally represent the best estimate of fair market value if they are done at arm’s
length.
Income Approach
The income approach provides an indication of value by converting future cash flow to a single current
value. Under the income approach, the value of an asset/the business entity is determined by reference to
the value of income, cash flow or cost savings generated by the asset/ the business entity. A fundamental
basis for the income approach is that investors expect to receive a return on their investments and that such
a return should reflect the perceived level of risk in the investment
Valuation Method Adopted
The valuation approach is determined based on professional judgment and technical expertise after
detailed analysis on facts and circumstances. Key factors we have considered include, among other criteria,
business nature and stage of development of the subject entity, the quantity and quality of the information
provided, access to available data, supply of relevant market transactions, type and nature of the subject
asset, purpose and objective of the valuation.
Under the cost approach, the fair market value of equity interest is determined based on the replacement
costs or reproduction costs of assets rather than the ability to generate streams of benefits in the future.
The value of the Bitdeer Group is more driven by the future earnings to be generated than the value of
its assets. The Bitdeer Group has established its own brand, its customer base and its business networks.
These are the intangible assets that exist in the business but not capitalized. Thus, the relationship between
the fair market value and the book costs is weak for the Bitdeer Group. Therefore, the cost approach has
been disclaimed.
Under the market approach, there are two primary methods. The first, often referred to as the
Comparable Transactions Method, involves determining valuation multiples from sales of enterprises with
similar financial and operating characteristics and applying those multiples to the subject enterprise. The
D-3-4 TABLE OF CONTENTS
second, often referred to as the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, involves identifying and
selecting publicly-traded enterprises with financial and operating characteristics similar to the enterprise
being valued.
According to our research, there were some merger and acquisition transactions regarding digital assets
mining companies taken place in the recent two years. However, there are limited historical and forecast
operational and financial information available on these newly listed / acquired entities. Thus, the
Comparable Transactions Method is not selected.
On the other hand, shares of several major market players in Bitcoin mining sector have been listed.
Different value measures or market multiples of the comparable companies are calculated and analysed to
induce a series of multiples that are considered representative of the industry average. Once publicly traded
enterprises are identified, valuation multiples can be derived, adjusted for comparability, and then applied to
the subject enterprise to estimate the value of its equity or enterprise value. The Guideline Publicly-traded
Comparable Method generally yields valuation information at the non-controlling, marketable level of value.
Thus, it has been selected as the principal valuation method for this valuation.
For the income approach, it relies on explicit financial forecasts which require many assumptions,
including but not limiting to the forecasted Bitcoin price, the future total Bitcoin network hashrates, the size
of transactions, the future transaction fees, the pace of market acceptance of cryptocurrency, the availability
of mining rigs and mining farms, the stability of electricity supply, etc. It is considered as inferior to the
market approach. In addition, the latest financial projection is not available for this valuation and thus, the
income approach is not selected.
Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method
In the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, the fair market value is based on prices at which
stocks of similar companies are trading in a public market. A “value measure” is usually a multiple computed
by dividing the price of the guideline company’s stock as at the valuation date by some relevant economic
variable observed or calculated from the guideline company’s financial statements.
Selection of Comparable Companies
A major requirement in applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method is to identify
companies that are comparable to the subject company in terms of business nature and associated risks. We
have selected comparable companies we think fit for this valuation primarily based on the following criteria:
(1) principally engaged in similar business (i.e., Bitcoin mining); (2) listed on a reputable capital market for
not less than 12 months from the Appraisal Date; and (3) with disclosure and/or recent market forecasts on
their key performance and financial metrics, such as hashrate, and EBITDA, for the year ended 31 December
2022.
There are five entities which are considered as closely comparative to the Bitdeer Group (the
“Comparable Companies”) and they are listed in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom for this
valuation.
The Comparable Companies are considered as highly but not perfectly comparable with the Bitdeer
Group in terms of capital structure, operating scale, product mix and business performance metrics. The
Comparable Companies are major market players and have a majority of their revenue contributed by Bitcoin
mining operations. The inclusion of five comparable companies also accommodates the fact of not perfectly
comparable business. As such, the below list of the Comparable Companies is considered as fair and
representative for the purpose of this valuation. A description of their business operation is summarized
below:

Market Multiple
In applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, different value measures or market
multiples of the comparable companies are calculated and analysed to induce a series of multiples that are
considered representative of the industry average. Then, we applied the relevant industry multiples to the
subject company to determine a value for the subject company that is on a freely-traded basis.
We have applied the market value of enterprise value (“E
V”) multiple in this valuation. EV equals to the
sum of (1) market capitalisation; (2) value of total debt; (3) value of preferred equity and non-controlling
D-3-6 
* 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
interest and less (4) value of cash and cash equivalents. EV is the value of a company’s core business
operations that is available to all shareholders (debt, equity, preferred, etc.). Market capitalisation adopted
represents the average of the market capitalisation of the Comparable Companies for the 15 trading days
prior to the Appraisal Date.
Hashrate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining. More simply, it is the
speed of mining. It is measured in units of hash/second, meaning how many calculations per second can be
performed. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and can process a lot of data in a single
second. In the case of Bitcoin, the hashrate indicates the number of times hash values are calculated for
PoW every second. Thus, hashrate is considered as one of the relevant economic multiples for this
valuation.
In recent years, the prices of Bitcoins have fluctuated greatly. The Bitcoin price decreased from
approximately US$46,300 as at 31 December 2021 to approximately US$16,500 as at 31 December 2022, with
the peak on 9 November 2021 at US$67,600. As at the Appraisal Date, it was valued at approximately
US$24,300. The Bitcoin halving event is expected to take place in early 2024.
The EV-to-revenue ratio looks at the revenue generating ability in the same industry. For profitability
and ability to generate operating cash flows, it can be measured by EBITDA which is capital structure-
neutral nature. EBITDA is also useful for transnational comparisons because it ignores the distorting effects
of individual countries taxation policies.
Specifically, we have applied the multiples of (1) EV-to-Forecasted/Actual Revenue for 2022; (2) EV-to-
Forecasted/Actual EBITDA for 2022; and (3) EV-to-Hashrate as at 31 January 2023, that is the most recent
available data as of the Appraisal Date of the Comparable Companies for this appraisal.
Based on the available market figures sourced from Bloomberg, we have arrived at the following ratios
of the Comparable Companies:

Excluded the Comparable Companies that had negative figure.
In terms of the revenue generating power, the EBITDA margin and the computational power capacity of
the Bitdeer Group is above average among the Comparable Companies, the third quartile of the value ratios
of the Comparable Companies are selected and considered as reasonable for this valuation.
In a challenging market for crypto based companies, especially where Bitcoin price is experiencing high
volatility, the ability to generate revenue and operating cashflows outweigh the importance of capacity.
Therefore, the following value ratios applied for this valuation are summarised as follows:

The indicated EV of the Bitdeer Group is the weighted average of the product of the selected ratios of
the Comparable Companies generated and its relevant financial and operational information. Given the
current market and recent developments of competitors and other crypto-based companies, the importance of
revenue and EBTIDA has become more significant, resulting in the suggested weighting. To derive the fair
market value of the entire equity interest, the net debts and non-operating assets and liabilities are first
deducted from the indicated EV and finally, the result is subject to a discount for lack of marketability
adjustment in order to derive the fair market value of the non-controlling, non-marketable equity interest in
the Bitdeer Group.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Discount for Lack of Marketability
The concept of marketability deals with the liquidity of an ownership interest, that is, how quickly and
easily it can be converted to cash if the owner chooses to sell. The discount for lack of marketability reflects
the fact that there is no ready market for shares in a closely held corporation. Ownership interests in closely
held companies are typically not readily marketable compared to similar interests in public companies.
Therefore, a share of stock in a privately held company is usually worth less than an otherwise comparable
share in a publicly held company.
Based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, a 15.0% discount is suggested for this valuation.
The discount is mainly calculated with the Finnerty model, which is one of the common quantitative methods
in assessing the discount for lack of marketability for the shares of private entity, like the Bitdeer Group. This
conclusion is also concurred with our findings on other relevant research papers (both formal and informal)
and valuation journals on valuation premiums and discounts which are publicly available.
X. VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS

materially affect the revenues, profits, cash flows attributable to the Bitdeer Group;
The Bitdeer Group and/or its partners will obtain the necessary licenses and approvals to provide
its service;
Exchange rates and interest rates will not differ materially from those presently prevailing;
The availability of finance will not be a constraint on the forecasted growth of operations of the
Bitdeer Group;
The Bitdeer Group will successfully maintain its competitiveness and market share through
optimizing the utilization of its resources and expanding its marketing network;

The sum of net debts and non-operating assets and liabilities of the Bitdeer Group as at 31 January
2023 amounted to approximately US$244,548,000. There is no material difference in the financial
position in the Bitdeer Group between 31 January 2023 and the Appraisal Date; and
The Bitdeer Group has no material unrecorded and/or contingent asset/liability as at the Appraisal
Date.

This opinion of value is based on generally accepted valuation procedures and practices that rely
extensively on the use of numerous assumptions and the consideration of many uncertainties, not all of
which can be easily quantified or ascertained. Any variation to the assumptions and limiting conditions
presented in the following report could seriously affect our opinion of value.
Although our valuation is intended to estimate fair market value, we assume no responsibility for the
inability of a seller or buyer to obtain a sale or purchase contract at that price.
BSGA has reviewed, confirmed, and agreed on this report, including the factual content it contains.
We have no obligation to update this report or our opinion of value for information that comes to our
attention after the date of this report.
We hereby confirm that we are independent of and not connected with the Bitdeer Group and BSGA,
