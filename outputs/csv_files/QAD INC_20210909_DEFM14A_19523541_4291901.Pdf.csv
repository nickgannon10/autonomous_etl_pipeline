For a further description of the treatment of equity compensation awards, See “Special Factors -
Certain Effects of the Merger,” “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Equity Compensation
Awards” and “Special Factors - Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the
Merger.”
Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger. In considering the
recommendations of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) with respect to the
Merger, the Company’s stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors have
certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the
Company’s stockholders generally. The Special Committee, consisting entirely of independent
directors, and the QAD Board were aware of these interests and considered them, among other
matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger and in making its recommendations. These interests include, but are not limited to, the
following:
the fees to be received by members of the Special Committee, in connection with their services to
the Company with respect to the Merger (which fee is not conditioned on the consummation of
the Merger);
the accelerated vesting and payment of awards of Vested Company SARs, Vested Company
RSUs, Vested Company PSUs and, for Ms. Bellamy, Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested
Company PSUs;
certain severance and other separation benefits, including equity award vesting acceleration,
that may be payable following termination of employment after the Effective Time of the Merger
under the named executive officer’s change in control agreement with the Company or the
Company’s change in control severance policy, as applicable;
the provision of indemnification and insurance arrangements pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
and
the Contribution and Exchange Agreement separately entered into by the Lopker Entities,
pursuant to which and immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Lopker Entities will contribute
to Ultimate Parent the Rollover Shares and, in exchange for such Rollover Shares, Ultimate Parent
will issue to the Lopker Entities the Parent Units.
For a more detailed description of the interests of executive officers and directors of the Company in
the Merger, see “Special Factors - Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in
the Merger.”
Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger. Our directors and
executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all
of the Shares owned directly by them in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal and
each of the other proposals. As of September 7, 2021, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, our
directors and executive officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 5,731,052 shares of Class A Common
Stock and 2,581,322 shares of Class B Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or
collectively approximately 68% of the total voting power entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. For
purposes of clarity, the Shares directly owned by the directors and executive officers shall be (i)
included in determining whether the Merger Agreement has been approved by the affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single
class, but (ii) excluded from determining whether the Merger Agreement has been approved by
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding Shares, voting as a
single class, that are not owned, beneficially or of record, by the Lopker Entities, their respective
affiliates, or any executive officer or director of the Company. For a further description of the voting
intentions of the Company’s directors and executive officers, see “Special Factors - Intent of the
Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger.”

capital stock, have duly executed and entered into a Support Agreement, pursuant to which they have
agreed to vote their Shares in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Support Agreement. Copies of the Support Agreement and the Lopker Family
Foundation’s Joinder to the Support Agreement are attached as Annexes B and F to the proxy

information about the Support Agreement and the voting intentions of the Lopker Entities, see
“Special Factors - Intent of the Lopker Entities to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “Special
Factors - Support Agreement.”
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of the Shares for cash
in the Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors - 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and may also be taxable under state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws. A U.S. Holder who solely
receives cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash received by such holder in the Merger and
the adjusted tax basis in the Shares surrendered in exchange therefor. Stockholders who are Non-U.S.
Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”) will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in
connection with the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United
States. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to a stockholder will depend on the
stockholder’s particular circumstances, and stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to
determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the application of any U.S. federal non-
income, state, local and non-U.S. tax laws) of the Merger. For further information about the material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger, see “Special Factors - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Financing of the Merger. The Merger is not subject to any financing condition. Parent estimates that
the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be
approximately $1.6 billion. Parent expects this amount to be funded via approximately $0.9 billion from
equity investments by TB Fund XIV and approximately $0.7 billion from debt financing by specified
lenders.
Parent has delivered to the Company the Equity Commitment Letter, pursuant to which TB Fund XIV
has committed, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, to provide equity financing in
an aggregate amount of up to $1,626,900,000 to Parent on or prior to the closing of the Merger in
connection with the funding of the transaction. The Company is a third party beneficiary of the rights
granted to Parent under the Equity Commitment Letter (if and only if the Company is entitled to
specific performance of Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger) solely for
the purpose of seeking specific performance of Parent’s right to cause the commitment to be funded
in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter (solely to the extent that Parent can
cause the commitment to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter). For
further information about the financing of the Merger, see “Special Factors - Financing of the
Merger.”
Limited Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent has delivered to
the Company a Limited Guaranty, dated as of June 27, 2021 (the “Limited Guaranty”), entered into by
TB Fund XIV in favor of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Limited Guaranty and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, TB Fund XIV has agreed to guarantee Parent’s obligations
under the Merger Agreement, capped at $133,000,000, with respect to payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and certain interest payments and reimbursement obligations of Parent. For a further
description of the Limited Guaranty, see Special Factors - Limited Guaranty.”
Regulatory Approvals. Under the HSR Act and the antitrust laws of certain other foreign
jurisdictions, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until notifications
have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,
and the Federal Trade Commission, and similar filings have been made under the antitrust laws of
certain other foreign jurisdictions, and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR
Act and the antitrust laws of certain other foreign jurisdictions, and the making of and receipt of,
certain other specified regulatory filings and consents, are conditions to completion of the Merger.
For a further description of the regulatory approvals required for the Merger, see “Special Factors -
Regulatory Approvals” and “The Merger Agreement - Regulatory Approvals; Third Party Consents.”
Litigation Relating to the Merger. Currently, the Company is aware of four (4) pending cases related
to the Merger. In Nantahala Capital Partners II L.P. v. QAD Inc., et al., a purported stockholder class
action filed in Delaware Chancery Court on July 2, 2021, the plaintiff alleges breaches of contract and
fiduciary duty against directors Anton Chilton, Scott Adelson, Kathleen Crusco, and Peter van
Cuylenburg (the “Director Defendants”), and Pamela M. Lopker, as well as a claim for aiding and
abetting a breach of fiduciary duty against Thoma Bravo and certain affiliates of Thoma Bravo
relating to the QAD Board's vote to approve the Merger Agreement. The complaint names the
Company as a defendant to the extent necessary for any of the relief requested. Plaintiff is seeking,
among other things, to enjoin the Closing of the Merger or, in the alternative, damages, including
rescissory damages. The plaintiff claims that the Contribution and Exchange Agreement (pursuant to
which and immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Lopker Entities will contribute to Ultimate
Parent the Rollover Shares and, in exchange for such Rollover Shares, Ultimate Parent will issue to the
Lopker Entities the Parent Units) and the Merger Agreement violate Article IV, Section 2.B(d) of
QAD’s corporate charter, which provides that holders of Class A Common Stock receive per Share
consideration no less favorable than that received by any holders of Class B Common Stock in any
merger. The plaintiff alleges that Ms. Lopker and the Director Defendants breached Article IV, Section
2.B(d) of QAD’s corporate charter, that Ms. Lopker’s participation in the separate Contribution and
Exchange Agreement with Thoma Bravo breached her fiduciary duties to the Company, that the
Director Defendants’ approval of the Merger breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, and that
Thoma Bravo and its affiliates aided and abetted those breaches. In a supplement to their complaint,
filed on August 16, 2021, Plaintiff alleges that the Director Defendants and Ms. Lopker breached their
fiduciary duties by disseminating a false, misleading, and materially incomplete Proxy, and that Thoma
Bravo aided and abetted those breaches. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that the Proxy, issued on August
2, 2021, provides an inaccurate description of the events leading to the Merger and the consideration
that Ms. Lopker will receive in connection with the Merger. The court has ordered that the case
proceed on an expedited basis. The Company believes the claims are without any merit. On August 5
and 6, 2021, purported shareholders of the Company filed two complaints in the District Court of the
Southern District of New York, captioned Stein v. QAD Inc., et. al., 1:21-cv-06856 and Whitfield v.
QAD, Inc., et. al., 1:21-cv-06674, both naming the Company and members of its board of directors as
defendants. On September 3, 2021, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a complaint in the
District Court of the Eastern District of New York, captioned Parmar v.QADInc., et al., 1:21-cv-04974,
naming the Company and members of its board of directors as defendants. All three actions assert
federal securities claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and related provisions for
alleged failures to disclose material information, and seek to enjoin or rescind the Merger with Thoma
Bravo and a request for an award of attorneys’ and experts’ fees and damages. The Company believes
these actions, too, are without merit. For a further description of litigation relating to the Merger, see
“Special Factors - Litigation Relating to the Merger.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and
consents. The Company, however, cannot assure Closing of the Merger by any particular date, if at
all. For more information about the Effective Time and Closing of the Merger, see “The Merger
Agreement - Effective Time of the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement - Closing of the Merger.”
Conditions to the Completion of the Merger. The Closing of the Merger depends on a number of
conditions being satisfied or waived. These conditions, which are described more fully in “The
Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Completion of the Merger,” include:
the Company Stockholder Approval to adopt the Merger Agreement;
the receipt of specified regulatory approvals, or expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period, under the HSR Act and antitrust laws of certain other foreign jurisdictions;
the absence of any order that remains in effect or any action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions and the absence of any law that
otherwise makes such consummation illegal or prohibited;
the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement (subject to
materiality qualifiers);
the performance in all material respects by each party of all obligations required to be performed by
it under the Merger Agreement; and
the delivery of an officers’ certificate by each party with respect to representation and warranties
and performance of obligations under the Merger Agreement.
For more information about the conditions to completion of the Merger, see “The Merger
Agreement - Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.”
Solicitation of Company Acquisition Proposals. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company
was required to cease, and cause its subsidiaries and their respective directors and officers to cease,
and instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective managers, employees, agents
and other representatives to cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations
with any person with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal as of June 27, 2021, and request the
prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning the Company and the
Company’s subsidiaries theretofore furnished to any such person, subject to certain exceptions. The
Company has agreed that, during the term of the Merger Agreement and subject to certain exceptions,
it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers not to, and
will instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective managers, employees,
agents and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate the making of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any other offer or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal.
If the Company receives a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal after June 27, 2021, and prior to
obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal (which Company Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach of the Company’s non-solicitation obligation under the Merger
Agreement), and the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel, that (I) such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal and (II) the failure to take certain
actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable law, then the Special Committee, the Company and their respective representatives will,
subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, be permitted to furnish
any information (including non-public information) or access thereto, and participate or engage in
negotiations or discussions regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
The QAD Board and any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) are prohibited from
taking certain actions enumerated in the Merger Agreement that would amount to a Company Change
in Recommendation unless, prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement, (i) the
Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
7 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that the failure to make such change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the QAD
Board’s fiduciary duties, (ii) the Company has provided Parent with prior written notice before making
any Company Change in Recommendation and, if requested by Parent in good faith, the Company has
negotiated in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement so that a
Company Change in Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (iii) after giving effect to
clause (ii), as required, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, the QAD
Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, has determined in good faith that failure
to make the Company Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties.
For more information about the restrictions on the Company’s solicitation of Company Acquisition
Proposals and Company Change in Recommendations, see “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation
by the Company.”
Termination. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including, but not limited to,
the right of (i) the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Company Superior
Proposal, or (ii) Parent to terminate the Merger Agreement upon a Company Change in
Recommendation, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, and provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company or
Parent under specified conditions, the Company will be required to pay Parent a Company
Termination Fee of  $59,000,000 in cash. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company
or Parent under specified conditions, Parent will be required to pay the Company a Parent Termination
Fee of $127,000,000 in cash. In addition, subject to specified exceptions and limitations, either party
may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by January 30, 2022. We refer
to January 30, 2022 as the Outside Date. For more information about the termination rights and

Why am I receiving this document?
On June 27, 2021, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Thoma Bravo, a private equity
investment firm and registered investment advisor. If the Merger is completed, the holders of Shares
(other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration
of $87.50 per Share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement in its entirety.
Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the QAD Board (other than
Ms. Lopker, who recused herself), among other things, (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and the Company’s stockholders, (ii) adopted and approved the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that the
Merger Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption and approval, and (iv)
resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
The Company is holding the Special Meeting so that our stockholders may vote to approve the Merger
Agreement Proposal, the Golden Parachute Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal.
The Company is soliciting proxies for the Special Meeting. You are receiving this proxy statement
because you own Shares. This proxy statement contains important information about the Merger and
the Special Meeting, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed proxy card allows you to vote your
Shares without attending the Special Meeting in person.
Your vote is extremely important, and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. For more
information on how to vote your Shares, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Special Meeting.”
What is the proposed transaction and what effects will it have on the Company?
The proposed transaction is the Merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed, the holders of Shares (other than the holders of the
Excluded Shares) will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $87.50 per Share in cash,
without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
In addition, following completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the Shares and, as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in compliance with applicable law, the
Company’s securities will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”), upon application to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”). As a result of the Merger, the Company will no longer be an independent public

company, the Shares will no longer be listed on any exchange or quotation system, price quotations will
no longer be available and the Company’s registration and reporting obligation under the Exchange Act
will cease.
Following completion of the Merger, your Shares will represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the right to receive dividends and other distributions, in each case, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and you will no longer have any
interest in the Company’s future earnings, growth, or value.
For more information about Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, see “The Merger Agreement.”
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders or if the Merger is
not completed for any other reason, the Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their
Shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, unless the Company is sold to a third party, the
Company will remain an independent public company, and the Shares will continue to be listed and
traded on the Nasdaq, so long as the Company continues to meet the applicable listing requirements. In
addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company expects that management will operate the
Company’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that the
Company’s stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they
are currently subject. There is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the
future value of your Shares, including the risk that the market price of Shares may decline to the extent
that the current market price of Shares reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.
For more information about what happens if the Merger is not completed, see “Special Factors - 
Certain Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed.”
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, the Company would be required to pay
Parent a Company Termination Fee of $59,000,000 in cash, or Parent would be required to pay the
Company a Parent Termination Fee of $127,000,000. For more information about termination fees, see

the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote in

owner of those Shares held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to

stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other
nominee as to how to vote your Shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to
attend the Special Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote
these Shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you provide a legal proxy from your broker, bank
or other nominee.

name,” see “The Special Meeting - Voting.”

What vote is required for the Company’s stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal?
The approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal, requires the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority
of the voting power of all outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single class and (ii) a majority
of the voting power of all outstanding Shares, voting as a single class, that are not owned, beneficially
or of record, by the Lopker Entities, their respective affiliates, or any executive officer or director of the

Class A Common Stock owned of record on the Record Date and each record holder of Class B Common

Adjournment Proposal - Proposal 3).”
How are the votes counted?
For each of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Golden Parachute Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” An abstention will have the same effect as
an “AGAINST” vote for these proposals and will count for purposes of determining if a quorum is
present at the Special Meeting. For more information, see “The Special Meeting.”
How does the QAD Board recommend that I vote?
Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the QAD Board (other than
Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) recommends that you vote:
“FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal;
“FOR” the Golden Parachute Proposal; and
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For more information, you should read “Special Factors - Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the
Merger; Recommendation of the QAD Board and the Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger” for a
discussion of the factors that the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who
recused herself) considered in deciding to recommend the approval of the Merger Agreement. See also
“Special Factors - Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.”
How will the Lopker Entities and the Lopker Family Foundation vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal?
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Company and Parent
entered into a Support Agreement with the Lopker Entities. On August 30, 2021 in anticipation of a
charitable gift of Shares, the Lopker Family Foundation (a Permitted Transferee, as defined in the
Support Agreement) executed a joinder to and became bound by the Support Agreement with respect to
the Shares gifted to the Lopker Family Foundation by the Lopker Entities. The Lopker Entities and the
Lopker Family Foundation hold approximately 67% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding
capital stock. Under the Support Agreement, the Lopker Entities and the Lopker Family Foundation
agreed to vote their Shares in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Support Agreement. The obligations of the Lopker Entities and the Lopker Family
Foundation under the Support Agreement will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i)
the mutual agreement of the parties thereto to terminate the Support Agreement, (ii) the Effective Time
of the Merger, and (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
In the event the QAD Board or any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) (x) withdraws
(or modifies, amends or qualifies in a manner adverse to Parent), or proposes publicly to withdraw (or
modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation or (y)
fails to include the Company Board Recommendation in the proxy statement, in each instance, in
compliance with the Merger Agreement, the obligation of the Lopker Entities and the Lopker Family
Foundation to vote the Shares listed in the Support Agreement as described above shall be modified
such that the Lopker Entities and the Lopker Family Foundation shall only be required to so vote such
number of Shares as is equal to the number of Shares that would represent, as at the time of such vote,
35% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company.
Copies of the Support Agreement and the Lopker Family Foundation’s Joinder to the Support
Agreement are attached as Annexes B and F to the proxy statement and are incorporated by reference in
the proxy statement in their entirety. For more information about the voting intentions of the Lopker
Entities, see “Special Factors - Intent of the Lopker Entities to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and

How do I vote?
If you are a stockholder of record as of the Record Date, you may vote your Shares on matters
presented at the Special Meeting in any of the following ways:
in person, by attending the Special Meeting and casting your vote in person;
by proxy (stockholders of record have a choice of voting by proxy):
on the Internet, by following the Internet proxy instructions printed on the enclosed proxy card;
by telephone, using the telephone number printed on the enclosed proxy card; or
by mail, by marking the enclosed proxy card, dating and signing it, and returning it in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope.
If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” by your broker,
bank or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee that you
must follow in order to have your Shares voted. Those instructions will identify which of the above
choices are available to you in order to have your Shares voted. Please note that if you are a beneficial
owner and wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, you must have a legal proxy from your broker,
bank or other nominee naming you as the proxy. You should allow yourself enough time prior to the
Special Meeting to obtain this proxy from the holder of record.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to
submit a proxy for your Shares, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly
recorded when submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone.
Please refer to the instructions on your proxy card or voting instruction form to determine the deadlines
for submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone. If you choose to submit your proxy by mailing
a proxy card, your proxy card must be received by our Corporate Secretary by the time the Special
Meeting begins.
Please note that if you attend the Special Meeting in person, cameras, recording devices and certain
other electronic devices will not be permitted at the Special Meeting.
For more information about voting, see “The Special Meeting - How to Vote.”
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your Shares. This written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a proxy statement.
The document used to designate a proxy to vote your Shares is called a proxy card. For more
information about voting by proxy, see “The Special Meeting - How to Vote.”
If I am a stockholder of record, what happens if I do not vote or submit a proxy card?
If you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, either in person or by proxy, your Shares will
not be voted at the Special Meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a
quorum exists.
Additionally, if you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, either in person or by proxy,
your failure to vote will (a) have the effect of counting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal with
respect to the approval threshold requiring the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting
power of all outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single class and (ii) a majority of the voting
power of all outstanding Shares, voting as a single class, that are not owned, beneficially or of record,
by the Lopker Entities, their respective affiliates, or any executive officer or director of the Company,
and (b) have no effect on the Golden Parachute Proposal (so long as a quorum is present) or the
Adjournment Proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present). For more information, see “The
Special Meeting.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If my Shares are held in “street name” by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other
nominee vote my Shares for me?
Your broker, bank or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your Shares if you instruct your
broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote. You should follow the instructions provided by your
broker, bank or other nominee regarding the voting of your Shares. Under applicable stock exchange
rules, absent your instructions, a broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority
to vote on “non-routine” matters and all of the matters to be considered at the Special Meeting are,
under such rules, “non-routine.” As a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of
such Shares, your broker, bank or other nominee is not empowered to vote such Shares.
If you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on at least one, but not all of the
proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting, your Shares will be voted according to your
instructions on those proposals for which you have provided instructions and will be counted as
present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. In this
scenario, a “broker non-vote” will occur with respect to each proposal for which you did not provide
voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee.
A failure to provide instructions with respect to any of the proposals and a broker non-vote will have
(a) the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal with respect to the approval
threshold requiring the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of all
outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single class and (ii) a majority of the voting power of all
outstanding Shares, voting as a single class, that are not owned, beneficially or of record, by the Lopker
Entities, their respective affiliates, or any executive officer or director of the Company, and (b) no effect
on the Golden Parachute Proposal (so long as a quorum is present) or the Adjournment Proposal
(regardless of whether a quorum is present). For more information, see “The Special Meeting - Voting.”
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the Shares voted?
A. If you vote by proxy, regardless of the method you choose to submit a proxy, the individuals named
on the enclosed proxy card, and each of them, with full power of substitution will vote your Shares in
the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone proxy processes or the proxy
card, you may specify whether your Shares should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or to “ABSTAIN”
from voting on, all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly execute your proxy card but do not mark the boxes indicating how your Shares should
be voted on a matter, the Shares represented by your properly execute proxy will be voted “FOR” the
Merger Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Golden Parachute Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal. For more information, see “The Special Meeting - How to Vote.”
Can I change or revoke my vote?
Yes. You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail,
at any time before it is exercised, by (1) submitting another proxy, including a proxy card, at a later date
by telephone or on the Internet or by timely delivery of a validly executed, later-dated proxy, (2) giving
written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, which must be filed with our Corporate
Secretary before the Special Meeting begins, or (3) attending the Special Meeting and voting in person.
If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” by your broker,
bank or other nominee, please refer to the information forwarded by your broker, bank or other nominee
for procedures on revoking your proxy.
Only your last submitted proxy will be considered. Please cast your vote “FOR” each of the proposals,
following the instructions set forth on your enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form provided by
your broker, bank or other nominee, as promptly as possible. For more information, see “The Special
Meeting - Proxies and Revocation.”

What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
If, as of the Record Date, you hold Shares as the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name,” or
through more than one broker, bank or other nominee, and also directly as the stockholder of record or
otherwise, you may receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction forms relating to the Special
Meeting. These should each be executed and returned separately in accordance with the instructions
provided in this proxy statement in order to ensure that all of your Shares are voted.
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
No. After the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal with detailed written
instructions for exchanging your Shares for the Merger Consideration. If, as of the Record Date, you are
the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may
receive instructions from your broker, bank or other Nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take
to effect the surrender of your Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Please do not send in
your certificates now.
What happens if I sell my Shares before the Special Meeting?
The Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is prior to both the date of the
Special Meeting and the consummation of the Merger. If you transfer your Shares before the Record
Date, you will not be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting and will not be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration. If you transfer your Shares after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting

Merger Consideration. If you transfer your Shares after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting
you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the Special Meeting, but will
transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your Shares.
Unless special arrangements are made, the person to whom you transfer your Shares after the Record
Date will not have a right to vote those Shares at the Special Meeting. For more information, see “The
Special Meeting - How to Vote.”
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
The Company has engaged Innisfree to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. The
Company has agreed to pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $40,000, and to reimburse Innisfree for
certain out-of-pocket fees, charges and expenses. The Company will indemnify Innisfree and its
affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses. The Company also will
reimburse brokers, banks, other nominees, custodians and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of
the Shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of our Shares and in
obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit
proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, over the Internet or in person. Our directors, officers and
employees will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies. For more information, see “The
Special Meeting - Solicitation of Proxies; Payment of Solicitation Expenses.”
What is householding and how does it affect me?
The SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers, banks and other nominees to
satisfy delivery requirements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by
delivering a single proxy statement. This process is commonly referred to as “householding” and can
result in significant cost savings for the Company. To take advantage of this opportunity, QAD,
brokers, banks and other nominees who hold your Shares may deliver only one proxy statement to
multiple stockholders who share an address unless one or more of the stockholders has provided
contrary instructions. The Company will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy
of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents
was delivered. For more information, see “The Special Meeting - Questions and Additional
Information” or “Where You Can Find More Information.”
What rights do I have to seek an appraisal of my Shares?
Each holder of Shares will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of such holder’s Shares as
determined by the Delaware Chancery Court if the Merger is completed, but only if such holder does not

requirements and procedures for demanding and perfecting appraisal rights set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL, which is the appraisal rights statute applicable to Delaware corporations. Failure to follow
precisely any of the statutory requirements and procedures will result in the loss of appraisal rights. A
copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex E to this proxy statement and is incorporated by
reference in its entirety. The requirements and procedures are also summarized in this proxy statement.

What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me if I am a U.S. Holder?
If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined below in “Special Factors - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), receipt of cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger generally
will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, you will recognize gain or
loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis
of your Shares. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular
circumstances, and you should consult your own tax advisors to determine how the Merger will affect
you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see the section below
“Special Factors - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Merger.”
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me if I am a Non-U.S. Holder?
If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below in “Special Factors - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain
recognized in connection with the Merger unless you have certain connections to the United States.
However, the tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and
you should consult your own tax advisors to determine how the Merger will affect you. For a more
detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see the section below “Special Factors - 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

The following, together with the summary of the Merger Agreement set forth under the section titled “The
Merger Agreement,” is a description of the material aspects of the Merger. While we believe that the
following description covers the material aspects of the Merger, the description may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully this entire document, including the
Merger Agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the
Merger. The following description is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Merger
Agreement. You may obtain additional information without charge as described in the section titled “Where

We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed,
the holders of Shares (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) will have the right to receive the

QAD regularly evaluates strategies for improving its competitive position and enhancing stockholder value.
As part of these evaluations, the QAD Board has, from time to time, considered various strategic
alternatives, such as public offerings, joint ventures, collaborations and business combinations, including a
possible merger or sale of QAD. From time to time, prior to 2021, QAD received unsolicited indications of
interest from third parties.
During 2019 and 2020, the QAD Board and senior management met from time to time with multiple potential
financial advisors, including, among other firms, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, which we refer to as Morgan
Stanley, to receive market and industry updates, evaluate the financial advisors’ capabilities, and to discuss
a potential review of strategic alternatives for QAD. No financial advisors were engaged.
On December 14, 2020, the QAD Board invited representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss with the QAD
Board the most recent developments in the software industry, equity markets, potential strategic alternatives
and the general economy.
On February 9, 2021, the QAD Board and its legal counsel, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, which we refer to
as Manatt, met to discuss, among other things, a potential review of strategic alternatives for QAD. In
connection with such discussion, a representative of Manatt provided the QAD Board with an overview of
legal considerations in connection with potential transactions, including the potential formation of a special
committee. After discussion and deliberation, the independent members of the QAD Board determined to
request that senior management of QAD meet with representatives of Morgan Stanley in order for such
representatives of Morgan Stanley to provide their views regarding recent developments in the software
industry and potential strategic options for the Company.
On February 18, 2021, Ms. Lopker, the President and founder of QAD, Mr. Anton Chilton, the Chief Executive
Officer of QAD, and Mr. Daniel Lender, the Chief Financial Officer of QAD, met with representatives of
Morgan Stanley to review potential strategic alternatives for QAD. After such meeting, Messrs. Chilton and
Lender discussed the meeting with Mr. Peter van Cuylenburg, the chair of the QAD Board.
Over the following days, after discussion and deliberation, the members of the QAD Board executed a
unanimous written consent, effective as of February 21, 2021, to form the Special Committee, with Mr. van
Cuylenburg, Mr. Scott Adelson, Ms. Kathy Crusco and Mr. Lee Roberts as its members. The QAD Board
determined each member of the Special Committee to be unaffiliated with, and otherwise independent from,
Ms. Lopker and to be otherwise independent and disinterested with respect to the Special Committee’s
mandate. The Special Committee was delegated the full power and authority of the QAD Board to review,
evaluate and negotiate potential strategic alternatives, to engage its own advisors and to make a
21 TABLE OF CONTENTS
recommendation to the QAD Board regarding any such transaction. The resolution also provided that the
QAD Board would not recommend any potential transaction to QAD stockholders without a prior favorable
recommendation by the Special Committee.
During this same period, members of the Special Committee recommended to Ms. Lopker that she retain
independent financial and legal advisors. Ms. Lopker also expressed to such members her willingness to
pursue a process, her openness to consider any type of transaction, and her preference for retaining an
ongoing stake in the Company.
On February 23, 2021, the Special Committee met with representatives of Morgan Stanley to further evaluate
Morgan Stanley’s capabilities and to review Morgan Stanley’s tentative proposed plan to reach out to third
parties potentially interested in a transaction with QAD.
On February 24, 2021, Ms. Lopker retained Paul Hastings LLP, which we refer to as Paul Hastings, as legal
counsel to the Lopker Entities in connection with a potential transaction.
On March 1, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting, at which the members discussed their review of, and
meetings with, various potential law firms that the Special Committee was considering for engagement as
legal counsel to the Special Committee.
On March 8, 2021, the Special Committee met and, after discussion and deliberation, approved the selection
of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, which we refer to as Paul, Weiss, as legal counsel to the
Special Committee. The Special Committee selected Paul, Weiss based, in part, on its experience representing
special committees in circumstances similar to that of the Special Committee. At this meeting, the Special
Committee also appointed Messrs. van Cuylenburg and Adelson as co-chairs of the Special Committee.
On March 9, 2021, the Special Committee provided Paul, Weiss an executed engagement letter formalizing
Paul, Weiss’s engagement as legal counsel to the Special Committee.
On March 15, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting, attended by representatives of Paul, Weiss and
Morgan Stanley, to discuss, among other topics, organizational matters to facilitate the Special Committee’s
review and process. During this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee
a preliminary overview of potential strategic alternatives for QAD. Morgan Stanley also disclosed its
relationships with respect to several potential counterparties. Also during such meeting, representatives of
Morgan Stanley confirmed that it had not performed any work or services for Ms. Lopker, nor had it provided
any financial analysis regarding QAD to any third party. The members of the Special Committee and
representatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussions in an executive session.
Thereafter, and after further discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee determined to engage
Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor, based in part, on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and
reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in QAD’s industry, and its knowledge of
QAD’s business and affairs, with such engagement being formalized in a written engagement letter dated
March 30, 2021.
During the period from mid-March 2021 to early May 2021, at the direction of the Special Committee,
representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted over 25 potential counterparties, including both potential
strategic counterparties and financial sponsors, to gauge their interest in potential transactions with QAD.
During this period, QAD entered into 18 confidentiality agreements with interested parties. None of these
confidentiality agreements included any standstill provisions.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender, met with representatives of all
18 parties that signed confidentiality agreements to provide background regarding QAD and its financial
performance.
During the period from mid-March 2021 to early May 2021, the Special Committee held regular weekly
meetings with its advisors, including on March 22, March 29, April 5, April 12, April 19 and April 26, 2021. All
meetings included discussion among the members of the Special Committee with representatives of Paul,
Weiss during an executive session. The Special Committee invited Messrs. Chilton and Lender to participate
in certain portions of such meetings, and instructed Messrs. Chilton and Lender not
22 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to have any discussions relating to information learned in a Special Committee meeting with anyone,
including Ms. Lopker, without the permission of the Special Committee.
On May 3, 2021, the Special Committee met with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley, as well
as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to discuss status
of the process and timeline for requesting preliminary indications of interest from the eight potential
counterparties who continued to show engagement in the process. After review and deliberation, the Special
Committee directed representatives of Morgan Stanley to send a process letter to such parties containing bid
instructions and procedures (the form of which was approved by the Special Committee) and to request
preliminary indications of interest by May 11, 2021. Over the course of the following weeks, representatives
of Morgan Stanley, together with Messrs. Chilton and Lender, continued to participate in due diligence
discussions upon the request of the potential counterparties involved in the process.
Also on May 3, 2021, the Special Committee discussed with its advisors outreach to additional potential
counterparties. At the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley then proceeded
to contact two additional potential counterparties, which we refer to as Party C and Party D, to gauge their
interest in participating in the process.
On May 10, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party C. Such confidentiality agreement
did not include any standstill provisions.
On May 11, 2021, on behalf of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley received written
preliminary, non-binding indications of interest from two of the eight parties who had been sent a process
letter, which indications were promptly provided to the Special Committee and its advisors. The two parties
who submitted preliminary indications of interest were Thoma Bravo and a party we refer to as Party B.
Thoma Bravo’s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which QAD stockholders would
receive up to $90 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash
consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Thoma Bravo’s indication of interest
independently raised the possibility of Ms. Lopker continuing to hold a portion of her interests in QAD by
rolling over a percentage of her holdings and also expressly stated that, in connection with its diligence,
Thoma Bravo representatives would require discussions with Ms. Lopker regarding her involvement in the
Company following the closing of the proposed transaction. Party B’s indication of interest outlined a
potential transaction in which QAD stockholders would receive approximately $86 per share in cash, subject
to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt
and equity. Party B also verbally indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley its request to meet with Ms.
Lopker to discuss her involvement in the Company following the closing of the proposed transaction. Both
Thoma Bravo and Party B indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that they would each require a
support agreement in connection with any transaction, which would require, among other things, that the
Lopker Entities vote in favor of the contemplated transaction (subject to certain exceptions) with the relevant
counterparty.
Four of the eight parties that received the process letter expressed to representatives of Morgan Stanley
potential interest in a transaction with QAD at a “low-to-no premium” value over the then-current publicly
traded price per share, but did not submit any indications of interest. The remaining two parties who had
received a process letter expressed to representatives of Morgan Stanley potential interest in a private
investment in public equity transaction with QAD, but did not submit indications of interest. On May 11,
2021, QAD’s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $67.30.
On May 12, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided to the Special Committee an updated
relationship disclosure letter with respect to Thoma Bravo and Party B, the two parties who submitted
preliminary indications of interest.
Also on May 12, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan
Stanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to
discuss the preliminary indications of interest received, the status of the process and potential next steps.
The Special Committee reiterated that Messrs. Chilton and Lender were not to have any discussions relating
to information learned in a Special Committee meeting with anyone, including Ms. Lopker, without
23 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the permission of the Special Committee, and added that no one other than members of the Special
Committee were to discuss the process or preliminary indications of interest with Ms. Lopker at that stage.
The members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussion during an
executive session of the meeting. After review and deliberation, the Special Committee determined to seek
additional details from each of Thoma Bravo and Party B regarding their respective preliminary indications of
interest.
On May 13, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party
C.
On May 14, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party D. Such confidentiality agreement
did not include any standstill provisions.
Also on May 14, 2021, Messrs. van Cuylenburg and Adelson met with Ms. Lopker to provide her with the
high-level terms of the preliminary indications of interest received from each of Thoma Bravo and Party B.
Ms. Lopker indicated that she was interested in continuing to have a role in QAD following the closing of a
potential transaction if one were to occur, and that she was open to discussions with each of Thoma Bravo
and Party B about such role. Ms. Lopker indicated that she had not yet decided whether she would seek a
rollover of a portion of her shares in QAD, but that she was leaning in favor of rolling a portion of her shares
in QAD as part of a potential transaction.
On May 17, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,
as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee) to discuss
the overall status of the process, as well as a potential process for involving Ms. Lopker in certain
discussions with Thoma Bravo, Party B, or other potential counterparties that may submit indications of
interest. Representatives of Morgan Stanley confirmed that, at the direction of the Special Committee, they
would schedule additional calls with Thoma Bravo and Party B to discuss further details of their respective
indications of interest. At that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed status and
feedback received from the other potential counterparties involved in the process that did not submit
indications of interest. After discussion and deliberation, representatives of Morgan Stanley confirmed that,
at the direction of the Special Committee, they would request that any remaining parties in the process
submit indications of interest by May 25, 2021. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of
Paul, Weiss had further discussion during an executive session of the meeting.
Over the course of the week of May 17, 2021, Messrs. Chilton and Lender, together with representatives of
Morgan Stanley, continued to participate in due diligence discussions upon the request of potential
counterparties.
On May 19, 2021, and on May 21, 2021, Ms. Lopker had initial discussions with each of Party B and Thoma
Bravo, respectively, with representatives of Morgan Stanley present on behalf of the Special Committee, to
discuss potential counterparties’ plans for QAD and Ms. Lopker’s potential involvement in QAD following
the closing of a potential transaction with each such counterparty. No discussion of any specific terms of
such an arrangement, or a potential rollover of a portion of Ms. Lopker’s shares in QAD, took place.
Following these meetings, Ms. Lopker indicated to Messrs. Adelson and van Cuylenburg that she was open
to further discussion with both of Thoma Bravo and Party B.
On May 21, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party
D.
On May 25, 2021, of the seven potential counterparties who had been sent a process letter, Morgan Stanley
received one additional written non-binding preliminary indication of interest, from two parties who
partnered together, which we refer to collectively as Party E. Such indication of interest included a range of
$80 to $82.50 per share, as well as a list of outstanding diligence items, and stated that any transaction would
be financed with a mix of debt and equity. Such indication of interest was promptly provided to the Special
Committee and its advisors. On May 25, 2021, QAD’s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was
$67.98.
On May 26, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting, with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan
Stanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special
24 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Committee). The Special Committee discussed with its advisors the preliminary indication of interest received
from Party E, and, after deliberation and discussion, the Special Committee directed representatives of
Morgan Stanley to inform Party E that the price included in its indication of interest was too low and it would
need to increase its offer price per share in order to proceed in the process.
At that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors also discussed feedback representatives of
Morgan Stanley received from the five other parties who had been sent a process letter and requested to
submit an indication of interest by May 25, 2021, but who did not submit an indication of interest.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley advised that certain of such parties indicated that they may be interested
in an at-market transaction with QAD, and were not willing to offer any premium to the then-current publicly-
traded market price. On May 26, 2021, QAD’s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $67.64.
Also at that meeting, the Special Committee discussed with its advisors outreach to additional potential
counterparties. At the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley then proceeded
to contact two additional potential counterparties, which we refer to as Party F and Party G, to gauge their
interest in participating in the process.
On May 27, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Special Committee its relationship
disclosure letter with respect to Party E and updated its prior disclosures with respect to each of Thoma
Bravo and Party B.
On May 28, 2021, at the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley followed up
with Party D, which had not submitted any indication of interest, and encouraged Party D to continue
considering a potential transaction with QAD. Party D indicated that it would no longer be participating in
the process.
Later that week and over the course of the week of May 31, 2021, Messrs. Chilton and Lender, together with
representatives of Morgan Stanley, continued to participate in due diligence discussions upon the request of
potential counterparties.
On June 1, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party F. Such confidentiality agreement
did not include any standstill provisions.
On June 2, 2021, Party C notified representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would no longer be participating
in the process.
On June 3, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party F
to provide background regarding QAD and its financial performance.
On June 7, 2021, the Special Committee met with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley, as well
as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to discuss the
status of the process and next steps. Representatives of Morgan Stanley stated that, after they had
contacted Party E to relay the Special Committee’s message that Party E would need to increase its price in
order to proceed in the process, Party E had responded that it would not increase its price, and that
representatives of Morgan Stanley should notify it if circumstances change and there would be an
opportunity to move forward in Party E’s proposed price range of $80 to $82.50 per share.
At that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors further discussed the status of Thoma Bravo,
Party B and the other two remaining parties in the process. After discussion and deliberation, the Special
Committee directed representatives of Morgan Stanley to communicate to all parties remaining in the process
to submit final proposals with respect to a potential transaction with QAD by June 15, 2021.
Also during that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed the potential terms of a
draft merger agreement that was to be provided to bidders in connection with soliciting bids. The draft
expressly stated that if Ms. Lopker seeks to participate in a rollover of any of her shares, then, in addition to
the stockholder vote required by Delaware law, the Special Committee would further require that the majority
of QAD’s disinterested stockholders also approve the transaction. The Special Committee and its advisors
discussed that this “majority of the minority” vote would be a non-waivable condition for the transaction,
and that such vote requirement would also be communicated to Ms. Lopker in the event she
25 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
sought to roll over any of her shares of QAD. The Special Committee and its advisors also discussed the
terms of a support agreement, which would require, among other things, that the Lopker Entities vote in
favor of the contemplated transaction with the relevant counterparty (subject to certain exceptions), which
the parties participating in the process had continued to indicate they would require in connection with a
potential transaction. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further
discussion during an executive session of the meeting.
On June 7, 2021, Party F notified representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would no longer be participating
in the process.
On June 8, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided a draft of the merger agreement to the potential
counterparties remaining in the process.
On June 9, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party G. Such confidentiality agreement
did not include any standstill provisions.
On June 11, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party
G to provide background on QAD and its financial performance.
On June 12, 2021, representatives of Paul, Weiss sent a draft support agreement to Paul Hastings, legal
counsel to Ms. Lopker.
On June 14, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,
as well as Mr. Chilton (who was present until excused by the Special Committee), to discuss the status of the
process and potential next steps. Representatives of Morgan Stanley relayed that Thoma Bravo had
communicated that, as a result of its further diligence, Thoma Bravo’s final proposal that it would submit the
next day on June 15, 2021 would likely be at a lower price per share than the initial price of $90 per share set
forth in its preliminary indication of interest submitted on May 11, 2021. After discussion and deliberation,
the Special Committee determined that it would review any proposals received with its advisors, and would
seek to ensure the highest price possible.
The Special Committee and its advisors also discussed an approach regarding the Special Committee’s
review of any proposals submitted on June 15, 2021, and determined that no terms should be shared with
Ms. Lopker until the Special Committee has reviewed such proposals with its advisors and has formed an
independent view on the proposals. The Special Committee also confirmed that it had made clear to Ms.
Lopker and the potential counterparties that the Special Committee must first agree to a price per share and
any other terms that are fair to all stockholders with a potential counterparty before any negotiations may
take place between such counterparty and Ms. Lopker and that, if Ms. Lopker sought a rollover of any
shares, then a vote of the majority of the minority of QAD stockholders would be required.
On June 15, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley received a proposal, including a revised draft merger
agreement from Thoma Bravo, which it promptly shared with the Special Committee and its advisors. Thoma
Bravo’s proposal lowered its offer price as compared to its earlier preliminary indication of interest - from $90
per share to $85 per share, due to its view of findings in its recent diligence. Thoma Bravo’s offer proposed
that Ms. Lopker may roll $150 million of her shares (valued at $85 per share) and explicitly stated that its
proposal, including the price per share in connection with the merger, was not premised or conditioned on
any rollover or the terms of such rollover. Thoma Bravo indicated that it was ready to execute a definitive
agreement in as soon as 72 hours and only had confirmatory due diligence left to complete. On June 15, 2021
QAD’s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $77.00.
On June 16, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley received a proposal and representatives of Paul, Weiss
received a revised draft merger agreement, each from Party B, which were promptly shared with the Special
Committee and its advisors. Party B’s proposal included an offer price of approximately $86 per share, just as
it had in its preliminary indication of interest. Party B’s offer invited Ms. Lopker to roll a portion of her
shares, stating that Party B proposed a minimum rollover of 30% and a maximum of 50% of Ms. Lopker’s
shares, and included a term sheet that described certain stockholder rights in connection with the securities
Ms. Lopker would receive in a rollover. Party B’s proposal indicated that it had due diligence left to complete
and would likely require about three more weeks before it would be in a position to execute a
26 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
definitive agreement, and that the terms of its offer remain subject to ongoing diligence. On June 16, 2021,
QAD’s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $78.03.
Also on June 16, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan
Stanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to
discuss the latest proposals received. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee directed
representatives of Morgan Stanley to communicate to Thoma Bravo and Party B that they would need to
increase their respective offer prices, and also that Party B should proceed more quickly than communicated
in its proposal. Morgan Stanley also relayed to Thoma Bravo that, subject to any future discussions with
Ms. Lopker, Thoma Bravo may need to consider altering the terms of their rollover proposal and the role Ms.
Lopker might play in the future. The Special Committee directed representatives of Morgan Stanley to
reiterate to both Ms. Lopker and Thoma Bravo that a rollover of any of Ms. Lopker’s shares would require a
“majority of the minority” stockholder vote, and such vote would be a non-waivable condition for the
merger. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussion
during an executive session of the meeting.
On June 16, 2021, the Special Committee received a revised offer from Thoma Bravo. Thoma Bravo’s revised
offer maintained a purchase price of $85 per share, but indicated they were open to further discussion with
regard to the amount of Ms. Lopker’s rollover. Thoma Bravo also included an offer to have Ms. Lopker
continue her involvement in QAD by forming and leading a strategic Advisory Board. On June 16, 2021, at
the direction of the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley shared the revised offer with Ms. Lopker.
Over the course of the period from June 16, 2021 to June 21, 2021, and at the direction of the Special
Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley had a number of discussions with each of Thoma Bravo and
Party B, communicating that such parties should increase their respective offer prices and that Party B
should expedite timing to get to a definitive agreement.
On June 17, 2021, Mr. van Cuylenberg discussed the revised offer from Thoma Bravo with Ms. Lopker. As
part of that discussion, Ms. Lopker shared with Mr. van Cuylenberg that the price was not as high as she
would want and that she would prefer a higher rollover and a more active role at the Company. Mr. van
Cuylenberg relayed Ms. Lopker’s position to Morgan Stanley.
On June 18, 2021, at the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley
communicated to Thoma Bravo that the Special Committee requested that it increase its offer price to $92 per
share, which Thoma Bravo stated it was not willing to do. On June 18, 2021, QAD’s closing share price of
Class A Common Stock was $72.93. Morgan Stanley also relayed Ms. Lopker’s preference for a higher
rollover and a board seat to Thoma Bravo.
On June 18, 2021, Paul, Weiss sent the Company’s disclosure letter and a revised draft of the merger
agreement to legal counsel to Party B.
On June 18, 2021, after further discussion with representatives of Morgan Stanley, Thoma Bravo informed
representatives of Morgan Stanley that it was willing to increase its offer price to $87.50 per share, and
indicated that this represented Thoma Bravo’s best and final offer. Thoma Bravo also offered a potential
rollover amount of up to $300 million for Ms. Lopker, as well as an offer of a board seat. Such revised offer
was promptly shared with the Special Committee and its advisors. On June 18, 2021, the last full trading day
prior to June 19, 2021, QAD’s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $72.93.
On June 19, 2021, Paul, Weiss sent the Company’s disclosure letter and a revised draft of the merger
agreement to Kirkland & Ellis LLP, legal counsel to Thoma Bravo, which we refer to as Kirkland & Ellis.
On June 19, 2021, Ms. Lopker informed the Special Committee that she had retained Moelis & Company as
her financial advisor.
On June 20, 2021, Ms. Lopker met with representatives of Thoma Bravo, with representatives of Morgan
Stanley present on behalf of the Special Committee and representatives of Moelis present on behalf of Ms.
Lopker, to discuss, among other things, Thoma Bravo’s approach for running QAD’s business after the
Merger and other terms Ms. Lopker was contemplating, including the possibility of Ms. Lopker purchasing
QAD’s headquarters property.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 21, 2021, as disclosed in a Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on April 29, 2021, Mr.
Roberts’s term on the QAD Board (and therefore Special Committee) ended pursuant to the term set forth in
the bylaws of the Company, and he did not stand for reelection.
On June 21, 2021, Party B communicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that it was withdrawing its
offer as it would not increase its price, which was still at approximately $86 per share, and nor would it
expedite the timeline for diligence. Such communication was promptly provided to the Special Committee and
its advisors.
On June 21, 2021, Paul Hastings sent Paul, Weiss a revised draft of the support agreement. Later that day,
Paul, Weiss sent a revised draft of the support agreement to Paul Hastings and to Kirkland & Ellis.
Also on June 21, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis sent a revised Company disclosure letter to Paul, Weiss.
Later on June 21, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan
Stanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to
discuss the status of the process. The Special Committee discussed potential steps it might take to persuade
Party B to change its decision and re-engage in the process. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an
update regarding Party G, the one additional potential counterparty still engaged in the process, noting that
such party had not submitted an offer and had not indicated that it was interested in moving forward. Later
that day, representatives of Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the Special Committee, again contacted Party
G to encourage it to submit a bid.
In that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed Thoma Bravo’s revised offer at
$87.50 per share, including whether there was an opportunity to further increase the price given the
negotiations over the prior week and Thoma Bravo’s statement that this was its “best and final” offer. The
Special Committee and its advisors also discussed the fairness of Thoma Bravo’s proposal’s price and terms
to stockholders not affiliated with the Lopker Entities, and that it was an attractive offer. After further
discussion and deliberation with its advisors, the Special Committee directed representatives of Morgan
Stanley to communicate to Thoma Bravo, that subject to other terms and conditions, the Special Committee
would be willing to recommend a transaction at $87.50 per share if such transaction included Thoma Bravo
providing a full equity commitment in connection with the financing of the transaction, and no financing
contingency. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further
discussion during an executive session of the meeting.
Later on June 21, 2021, a representative of Paul, Weiss communicated to representatives of Paul Hastings
and Kirkland & Ellis that they could now engage in discussions regarding a potential rollover and post-deal
arrangements.
On June 22, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss.
Later on June 22, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis sent a proposed contribution and exchange agreement and equity
term sheet to Paul Hastings which was also shared with the Special Committee and its advisors. Such
documents were intended to provide the terms and conditions of Ms. Lopker’s rollover of certain of her QAD
shares.
On June 23, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the Special Committee, contacted
Party G again to encourage it to submit a bid.
On June 24, 2021, Party G indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would no longer be
participating in the process.
On June 24, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,
to discuss the status of the process. The Special Committee also discussed Ms. Lopker’s role at QAD
following the closing of the potential transaction with Thoma Bravo, and terms being negotiated between her
and Thoma Bravo, including Ms. Lopker seeking that a certain amount of her shares participate in a rollover.
The Special Committee and its advisors discussed such topics as well as status of the draft merger
agreement, key terms and other open issues.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On June 25, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,
to discuss the status of the process and open issues in the draft merger agreement and other transaction
documents. Representatives of Morgan Stanley stated that, after extensive negotiations, Thoma Bravo
indicated that it would agree to provide a full equity commitment in connection with the financing of the
transaction which would eliminate the need for Thoma Bravo to secure debt financing and enhance the
certainty of closing the proposed transaction. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed the same,
and the Special Committee directed Paul, Weiss to revise the documents to reflect, among other terms, such
full equity commitment and a supporting guarantee from TB Fund XIV L.P., an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, L.P.
At that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed other developments in the market,
including the recently announced proposed acquisition of Plex Systems by Rockwell Automation, including
the revenue multiple and other terms obtained in the Plex Systems transaction and discussed factors that
differentiated Plex Systems from QAD, including, among other factors, Plex System’s business in Industrial
IOT, growth and margin profile, the fact that Plex Systems has 500 employees and its operations are U.S.-
based, and the synergies created through acquisition by a strategic counterparty. The members of the
Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussion during an executive session of
the meeting.
On June 27, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Special Committee an updated

Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis of the transactions and
rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of June 27, 2021, and based upon and
subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations
on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the Merger
Consideration to be received by the Company’s stockholders (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders in the
aggregate. Following discussion, the Special Committee unanimously (i) determined that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and the Company’s stockholders; (ii) recommended that the QAD Board
approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and

Prior to the opening of equity trading markets in the United States on June 28, 2021, QAD issued a press
release announcing the signing of the Merger Agreement with an affiliate of Thoma Bravo.
Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the QAD Board and the Special Committee;
Fairness of the Merger
As described in the section entitled “Background of the Merger,” the QAD Board duly established the
Special Committee and delegated to it the exclusive power and authority, among other things, to (i) review
and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability of any potential transactions with
respect to the Company and any alternatives thereto, (ii) negotiate with the counterparties to any such
potential transaction or any other party the Special Committee deems appropriate with respect to the terms
and conditions of any such potential transaction or any alternatives thereto and, if the Special Committee
deems appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve the execution and delivery of
documents pertaining to a given transaction or any alternative transaction on behalf of the Company, (iii)
determine whether such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto negotiated by the Special Committee
is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and all of its stockholders (and to the extent Ms. Lopker
is determined to have an interest in such proposed transaction different from the interests of the other
shareholders, other than Ms. Lopker), (iv) recommend to the full QAD Board what action, if any, should be
taken by the QAD Board with respect to such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto, and (v) retain
independent legal counsel and such other consultants and agents, including, without limitation, independent
investment bankers, as the Special Committee deems necessary or appropriate to perform such services and

Prior to the opening of equity trading markets in the United States on June 28, 2021, QAD issued a press
release announcing the signing of the Merger Agreement with an affiliate of Thoma Bravo.
Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the QAD Board and the Special Committee;
Fairness of the Merger
As described in the section entitled “Background of the Merger,” the QAD Board duly established the
Special Committee and delegated to it the exclusive power and authority, among other things, to (i) review
and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability of any potential transactions with
respect to the Company and any alternatives thereto, (ii) negotiate with the counterparties to any such
potential transaction or any other party the Special Committee deems appropriate with respect to the terms
and conditions of any such potential transaction or any alternatives thereto and, if the Special Committee
deems appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve the execution and delivery of
documents pertaining to a given transaction or any alternative transaction on behalf of the Company, (iii)
determine whether such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto negotiated by the Special Committee
is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and all of its stockholders (and to the extent Ms. Lopker
is determined to have an interest in such proposed transaction different from the interests of the other
shareholders, other than Ms. Lopker), (iv) recommend to the full QAD Board what action, if any, should be
taken by the QAD Board with respect to such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto, and (v) retain
independent legal counsel and such other consultants and agents, including, without limitation, independent
investment bankers, as the Special Committee deems necessary or appropriate to perform such services and
render such opinions as may be necessary or appropriate in order for the Special Committee to discharge its
duties.
The Special Committee, acting with the advice and assistance of its independent legal and financial advisors,
evaluated and negotiated the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, and after careful consideration, at a meeting of the Special Committee held on June 27, 2021, the
Special Committee, among other things, unanimously:
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company’s
stockholders;
recommended that the QAD Board approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, and declare the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the
Company’s stockholders; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
recommended that, subject to approval by the QAD Board, the QAD Board resolve to recommend
that the holders of Shares vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
On June 27, 2021, after careful consideration, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee, the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself), pursuant to resolutions adopted at
a meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself), among other things:
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company’s
stockholders;
adopted and approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger;
directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption and
approval; and
resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
Accordingly, the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the
Merger Agreement Proposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, at the Special Meeting.
In considering the recommendations of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) with
respect to the Merger, you should be aware that executive officers and directors have certain interests in the
Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally.
The Special Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, and the QAD Board were aware of
these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and in making its decision to recommend that the
QAD Board adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger. For more information about these interests, refer to the section entitled “Interests of Executive
Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.” The Special Committee and the QAD Board (other
than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) believe that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are fair to the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders.
The Special Committee engaged its own independent legal and financial advisors and received advice
throughout the negotiations from such advisors. Since the members of the Special Committee are
disinterested with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, independent of, and
not affiliated with, the Parent Entities or the Lopker Entities, the Special Committee believed that it could
effectively represent the interests of the Unaffiliated Stockholders in negotiating the terms of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and in making its decision to
recommend that the QAD Board adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and
making the decisions, determinations and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the
QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) considered, among other things, the following
potentially positive factors, which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative
order of importance:
the current and historical market prices of the Shares, including as set forth in the table under “Other
Important Information Regarding the Company - Market Price of Common Stock and Dividends,”
taking into account the market performance of the Shares relative to the common stock of other
participants in the industry in which the Company operates and general market indices;
certain factors related to the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and
the Company’s prospects and plans, including:
the reviews undertaken by, and understandings of, the Special Committee and the QAD Board
(other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) with respect to the Company’s business, operations,

assets, financial condition, earnings, ownership structure, management, strategy, competitive
position, current, historical and projected financial performance, prospects and plans, as well as the
associated risks involved achieving such projections, prospects and plans;
the reviews undertaken by, and understandings of, the Special Committee and the QAD Board
(other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) with respect to economic and market conditions and
trends, as well as the challenges and uncertainty surrounding such conditions and trends, both on
a historical and prospective basis, in the near term and the long term, such as:
the nature of the industry in which the Company operates, including anticipated industry trends
and changing competitive dynamics;
the risks and uncertainties relating to the ongoing industry transition to a cloud-based business,
including to be able to compete effectively in the markets in which the Company operates or may
operate in the future;
the risks and uncertainties relating to anticipated structural changes in the Company’s industry
due to technological changes and geopolitical uncertainties;
the potential risks to the Company of continuing to have publicly traded common stock, including
the risks of market volatility and the risks relating to the Company’s dual-class stock structure,
including:
the potentially adverse impact of the dual-class stock structure on the market for the Company’s
Shares, because each class has less of a public float than it would if there was a single class of
Shares;
the fact that there are fewer shares of Class B Common Stock than shares of Class A Common
Stock and the Class B Common Stock may be less desirable to the public due to the 20% higher
dividend on the Class A Common Stock; and
the risk that the holding of lower voting Class A Common Stock may not be permitted by the
investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to managers of
certain institutional investors.
certain compliance costs and obligations imposed on the Company as a result of having publicly
traded common stock;
the risks and uncertainties relating to the Company’s concentrated stock ownership;
the management forecasts prepared by the Company’s management for, or otherwise made
available to, the Special Committee and the QAD Board;
certain challenges and limitations on the Company of continuing as a stand-alone public company,
including:
the execution risk associated with, and potential for business disruption and negative stock
price reaction in connection with, carrying out a world-wide organizational restructuring for
expense reduction and margin improvement;
the fact that the Merger Consideration consists solely of cash, providing the Company’s
stockholders with certainty of value and immediate liquidity at an attractive per Share equity value
without the market or execution risks associated with continued independence;
the beliefs of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself)
that the Merger represents the best transaction reasonably available for Company stockholders in
light of the foregoing factors as well as, among other things:
the views of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused
herself) that the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Shares in accordance with the
Merger Agreement represented the highest per Share consideration that could reasonably be
obtained;
the beliefs of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused
herself) that the per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Shares, was more
32

TABLE OF CONTENTS
favorable to such holders than the potential value that might result from other alternatives
reasonably available to the Company, including the alternative of remaining an independent
company and pursuing the Company’s current strategic plan, and other strategic or financial
alternatives that might be undertaken as an independent company, in light of a number of factors,
including the risks and uncertainties associated with those alternatives, and the administrative and
compliance costs associated with operating the Company as a publicly traded company;
that the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself), with
the assistance of their respective independent legal and other advisors, had considered
alternatives, including continuing to operate the Company on a standalone basis, other potential
value creating options or a sale to an alternative buyer, and considered the risks and uncertainties
associated with such alternatives, and each respectively formed the view that no other alternatives
were reasonably likely to create greater value for the Company’s stockholders than the Merger,
taking into account the alternatives reasonably available to the Company and the risk of execution,
as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks (as more fully described under “Special
Factors - Background of the Merger”);
the beliefs of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused
herself) that, after such extensive negotiations conducted at the direction of the Special Committee,
with the assistance of experienced independent legal and financial advisors, the Company obtained
the best terms and highest price that Parent is willing to pay for the Company, pursuant to a
thorough process and that further negotiations would have created a risk of causing Parent to
abandon the Merger altogether or materially delay the entry into definitive transaction agreements
with respect to the Merger;
the fact that since the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, none of the Company, Parent,
the Special Committee, the QAD Board, nor any of their respective independent legal and financial
advisors, as applicable, have received any inbound inquiries from third parties related to potential
alternative acquisition proposals;
the reviews undertaken by the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who
recused herself) of the Merger Agreement and the structure of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including, among others, the specific financial and other terms and conditions set out below;
the terms of the Merger Agreement permitting the Company to receive unsolicited Company
Acquisition Proposals (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that do not result from any breach of the
non-solicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement, and the other terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, including:
that the Company may, in certain circumstances (i) furnish any information or access thereto to any
third party making such a Company Acquisition Proposal and its representatives and potential
financing sources and (ii) participate or engage in negotiations or discussions with such third
party and its representatives and potential financing sources regarding such Company Acquisition
Proposal, provided, in each case, the Company Acquisition Proposal is received prior to obtaining
the requisite Company Stockholder Approval with respect to the Merger Agreement Proposal;
that the Merger Agreement may be terminated, in certain circumstances, including, among others,
by the Company to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company
Superior Proposal, provided that the Company pay Parent a Company Termination Fee of
$59,000,000 in cash, which amount the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms.
Lopker, who recused herself) believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and taking into
account the range of such termination fees in similar transactions, and the unlikelihood that a fee of
such size would be a meaningful deterrent to other acquisition proposals; and
that the QAD Board may, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, in certain
circumstances, make a Company Change in Recommendation, including in response to (i) a
Company Intervening Event, or (ii) a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the
QAD Board determines constitutes a Company Superior Proposal,
in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;

the likelihood of the Merger being completed, based on, among other matters:
Parent having delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Equity
Commitment Letter to which the Company is a third-party beneficiary, pursuant to which the
Ultimate Parent has committed to provide, subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter, equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to
$1,626,900,000 to be used solely for the purpose of providing the financing for the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement at the Closing of the Merger, including the fees and
expenses related thereto, noting that the aggregated amount represents the amount estimated to be
required to fund the Required Amount, as defined in the Merger Agreement, at the Closing;
the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement;
the Company’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific
performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur;
the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain
circumstances, Parent pay the Company a Parent Termination Fee of $127,000,000 in cash, subject
to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (as more fully
described under “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fees”);
the Limited Guaranty, provided by TB Fund XIV, in favor of the Company, pursuant to which TB
Fund XIV has agreed to guarantee Parent’s obligations under the Merger Agreement, capped at
$133,000,000, with respect to payment of the Parent Termination Fee and certain interest payments
and reimbursement obligations of Parent;
the requirement that Parent and Merger Sub use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
the regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and
the likelihood and anticipated timing of completing the proposed Merger in light of the scope of the
conditions to completion, including that there were no anticipated substantive issues expected in
connection with the required regulatory approvals;
other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
the beliefs of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused
herself) that the Company Termination Fee is reasonable in light of, among other matters, the
benefit of the Merger to the Company’s stockholders, the size of such termination fee in similar
transactions and the enterprise value of the Company;
the terms of the Merger Agreement providing the Company sufficient operating flexibility to
conduct its business in the ordinary course until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger or
the termination of the Merger Agreement;
the Company’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific
performance to prevent certain breaches of the Merger Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub; and
the scope of the representations, warranties and covenants being made by the Company and
Parent;
the fact that Morgan Stanley rendered to the Special Committee its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, that as of June 27, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be
received by the Company’s stockholders (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to
the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such Company stockholders in the
aggregate (as more fully described under “Special Factors - Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.
LLC”);
the beliefs of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself)
that they were fully informed about the extent to which the interests of the Lopker Entities in the
Merger differ from those of the Company’s other stockholders;

the fact that the Lopker Entities, who, together with the Lopker Family Foundation, hold
approximately 67% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, have duly
executed and entered into a Support Agreement, pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their
Shares in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Support Agreement;
the fact that the Support Agreement terminates in the event that the Merger Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with its terms, as more fully described in the section titled “Special
Factors - Support Agreement”;
the fact that the Merger Agreement is subject to approval and adoption by the affirmative vote of
holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of all outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a
single class and (ii) a majority of the voting power of all outstanding Shares, voting as a single class,
that are not owned, beneficially or of record, by the Lopker Entities, their respective affiliates, or any
executive officer or director of the Company; and
the right of Company stockholders to exercise their statutory appraisal rights under the Section 262 of
the DGCL and receive payment of the fair value of their Shares in lieu of the Merger Consideration to
be paid per Share, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and the DGCL, unless and until any such Company stockholder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses his, her, its or their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and
making the decisions, determinations and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the
QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) considered, among other things, a number of
procedural safeguards that they believed were and are present to ensure the fairness of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and to permit the Special
Committee to represent effectively the interests of the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders and in light of
such procedural safeguards the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused
herself) did not consider it necessary to retain an unaffiliated representative to act solely on behalf of the
Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders for purposes of negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement or
preparing a report concerning the fairness of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger. These procedural safeguards include, among other things, the following, which are not
intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of importance:
that the Special Committee was formed at the outset of Company’s consideration of a potential
transaction and prior to any consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger;
that the Special Committee consists entirely of directors who are independent of, and not affiliated
with, the Parent Entities or the Lopker Entities or any of their respective affiliates, and who are not
members of the Company’s management;
that the members of the Special Committee are disinterested with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and had no financial interest in the
Merger different from, or in addition to, the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders generally (other
than as described in “Special Factors - Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company
in the Merger”);
that the members of the Special Committee were adequately compensated for their services and that
their compensation was in no way contingent on their approving the Merger Agreement and taking
the other actions described in this proxy statement;
that the Special Committee had exclusive authority to decide whether or not to proceed with a
transaction or any alternative thereto, subject to the QAD Board’s approval of the transactions;
that the Special Committee retained and was advised by its own experienced and independent legal
and financial advisors;
that the Special Committee had the exclusive power and authority, among other things, to (i) review
and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability of any potential transactions

with respect to the Company and any alternative thereto, (ii) negotiate with the counterparties to any
such potential transaction or any other party the Special Committee deems appropriate with respect to
the terms and conditions of any such potential transaction or any alternatives thereto and, if the
Special Committee deems appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve the
execution and delivery of documents pertaining to a given transaction or any alternative transaction
on behalf of the Company, (iii) determine whether such proposed transaction or any alternative
thereto negotiated by the Special Committee is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
all of its stockholders (and to the extent Ms. Lopker is determined to have an interest in such
proposed transaction different from the interests of the other shareholders, other than Ms. Lopker)
and (iv) recommend to the full QAD Board what action, if any, should be taken by the QAD Board
with respect to such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto;
that the QAD Board was not permitted to recommend any potential transaction or any alternative
thereto for approval by the Company’s stockholders or otherwise approve any proposed transaction
or any alternative thereto without a prior favorable recommendation of such proposed transaction or
alternative thereto by the Special Committee;
that the Special Committee had no obligation to recommend any transaction, including a transaction
with Parent, and that the Special Committee had the authority to reject any proposals made by Parent
or any other person;
that prior to the entry into the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee and its independent
advisors were permitted to solicit, initiate, propose or introduce the making, submission or
announcement of, or encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or offer that could constitute a
potential transaction with respect to the Company from any person;
that the Special Committee, together with its independent financial and legal advisors, conducted an
extensive process, involving frequent and extensive deliberations and negotiations over a period of
time, to consider:
potential transactions and alternatives thereto, including engaging with potential counterparties;
and
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
and, in each case, each member of the Special Committee was actively engaged in that process on a
regular basis and was provided with full access to the Company’s management and its advisors in
connection with the evaluation process (as more fully described under “Special Factors - 
Background of the Merger”);
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to Company
Stockholder Approval, which includes a “majority-of-the-minority” voting requirement, pursuant to
which the Merger Agreement must be approved and adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the voting power of all outstanding Shares, voting as a single class, that are not owned,
beneficially or of record, by the Lopker Entities, their respective affiliates, or any executive officer or
director of the Company, in addition to approval and adoption by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the voting power of all outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single class;
that, the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were the product of
extensive negotiations between the Special Committee and its legal and financial advisors, on the one
hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates and advisors, on the other hand, that resulted,
among other things, in an increase in the Merger Consideration during the course of negotiations as
compared to Parent’s purported final proposal, and the improvement, from the perspective of the
Company, of other terms of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, including the Ultimate Parent’s
commitment, pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, to invest in Parent $1,626,900,000, to be used
solely for the purpose of funding the Required Amount, the operating covenants and the amount of
the termination fees, relative to Parent’s initial proposed terms;
the various terms of the Merger Agreement that are intended to help ensure that the Company’s
stockholders receive the highest price per Share reasonably available, including:

by the Company to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company
Superior Proposal (as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement”), provided that the
Company pay Parent the Parent Termination Fee;
that the QAD Board may, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, in certain
circumstances, make a Company Change in Recommendation, including in response to (i) a
Company Intervening Event, or (ii) a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the
QAD Board determines constitutes a Company Superior Proposal;
in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;
and
that the Special Committee made its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, based upon the factors discussed in this proxy
statement and with the full knowledge of the interests of the Lopker Entities in the Merger.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and
making the decisions, determinations and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the
QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) also considered, among other things, certain
countervailing factors, including the following uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors,
which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of importance:
that, following the completion of the Merger, the Company will no longer exist as an independent
public company and that the consummation of the Merger and receipt of the Merger Consideration,
while providing relative certainty of value, will not allow the Company’s stockholders (other than the
Lopker Entities) to participate in potential further growth in the Company’s assets, future earnings
growth, future appreciation in value of the Shares or any future dividends after the Merger;
the risk that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger may not
be consummated in a timely manner or at all, for a variety of reasons, and the consequences thereof,
including (i) the potential loss of value to the Company’s stockholders, including the reduction of the
trading price of the Shares (ii) the potential negative impact on the operations and prospects of the
Company, including the risk of loss of key personnel and certain key members of senior management,
and (iii) the market’s perception of the Company’s prospects could be adversely affected if such
transactions were delayed or were not consummated;
the possible effects of the pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the potential for suits, actions or proceedings in respect of the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the risk of any loss or change
in the relationship of the Company and its subsidiaries with their respective employees, agents,
customers and other business relationships, and any possible effect on the Company’s ability to
attract and retain key employees, including that certain key members of senior management might
choose not to remain employed with the Company prior to the completion of the Merger;
the risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the Merger, including in connection with any
litigation that may arise in the future;
the risks and potentially negative factors described in “Special Factors - Certain Effects of the
Merger” and “Special Factors - Certain Effects on the Company if the Merger is not Completed,”
respectively;
that the Company’s directors, officers and employees have expended and will expend extensive
efforts attempting to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and such
persons have experienced and will experience significant distractions from their work during the
pendency of such transactions and that the Company has incurred and will incur substantial costs in
connection with such transactions, even if such transactions are not consummated;
that the receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger
Agreement will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

the restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement on the Company’s solicitation of acquisition
proposals from third parties, and that prospective bidders may perceive Parent’s right under the
Merger Agreement to negotiate with the Company to match the terms of any Company Superior
Proposal prior to the Company being able to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Company
Superior Proposal to be a deterrent to making alternative proposals;
that the Lopker Entities’ existing ownership interest in the Company and obligations under the
Support Agreement would likely be taken into account by third parties considering whether to make
alternative proposals;
the possibility that the Company may be required to pay Parent a Company Termination Fee of
$59,000,000 in cash under certain circumstances, including upon termination of the Merger Agreement
to accept a Company Superior Proposal (as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement - 
Termination Fees”);
the possibility that the Parent Termination Fee of $127,000,000 in cash payable by Parent to the
Company, together with other specified amounts, may be the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company due to (a) Parent’s breach of, or
failure to perform its representations, warranties or obligations under the Merger Agreement or (b)
Parent’s failure to consummate the Merger at such time at which all of the applicable conditions to
Closing have been satisfied (subject to certain conditions) or (ii) by Parent or the Company if the
transaction fails to close on or before January 30, 2022 and such failure is not caused by the party
seeking termination, and the Company would have been otherwise entitled to terminate the Merger
Agreement for either of the reasons set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above;
that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets and the Limited
Guaranty, provided by TB Fund XIV, is capped at $133,000,000, with respect to payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and certain interest payments and reimbursement obligations of Parent;
that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with the Company’s entry into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, the Lopker Entities have not agreed to vote
their Shares in favor of such Company Superior Proposal;
in the event that the QAD Board or any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) (i)
withdraws or changes its recommendation that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, or publicly proposes to
do so, or (ii) fails to include in the proxy statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) the
recommendation that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, in compliance with the Merger Agreement,
the Lopker Entities may still be required to vote such Shares equal to 35% of the total voting power of
the outstanding Shares (a) in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, (b) against any Company Acquisition Proposal and any action,
agreement or transaction that would reasonably be expected to materially impede, interfere with, delay
or postpone the consummation of the Merger, and (c) in favor of any other matter necessary to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and considered and voted
upon by the stockholders of the Company, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Support Agreement;
the understanding that the Lopker Entities, their affiliates and various executive officers and directors
have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the
Company’s stockholders generally (as discussed under “Special Factors - Interests of Executive
Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger”); and
the restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the
Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which could delay or prevent the Company
from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take
with respect to the operations of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.
The Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) concluded that,
overall, the potentially positive factors outweighed the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
factors relevant to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
Accordingly, the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself)
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger are
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company’s stockholders.
Accordingly, the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the
Merger Agreement Proposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, at the Special Meeting.
In the course of evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, and making the decisions, determinations and recommendations described above, the Special
Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) did not consider the liquidation
value of the Company because (i) they considered the Company to be a viable, going concern, (ii) they
believed that liquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of going concerns,
(iii) they considered determining a liquidation value to be impracticable given the significant execution risk
involved in any breakup of the Company and (iv) the Company will continue to operate its business
following the Merger. For the foregoing reasons, the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms.
Lopker, who recused herself) did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant methodology. Further, the
Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) did not consider net
book value, which is an accounting concept, as a factor because they believe that net book value is not a
material indicator of the value of the Company as a going concern but rather is indicative of historical costs
and because net book value does not take into account the prospects of the Company, market conditions,
trends in the industry in which the Company operates or the business risks inherent in that industry. The
Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) did not seek to
determine a pre-Merger going concern value for the Shares to determine the fairness of the Merger
Consideration to the Company’s stockholders. The Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms.
Lopker, who recused herself) believe that the trading price of the Shares at any given time represents the
best available indicator of the Company’s going concern value at that time so long as the trading price at
that time is not impacted by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. The Special
Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) carefully considered the advice
and opinion of Morgan Stanley. Although the reference to the Company’s stockholders in the opinion of
Morgan Stanley did not exclude the Company’s directors and officers (other than those affiliated with the
Lopker Entities) notwithstanding that such persons are deemed affiliates of the Company, such reference did
not affect the determination of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who
recused herself) in respect of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger, because such directors and officers will receive the same Merger Consideration as Unaffiliated
Stockholders.
The Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) are not aware of
any firm offer for a merger, sale of all or a substantial part of the Company’s assets, or a purchase of a
controlling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company from anyone other than
a filing person in the two (2) years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement
The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive, but is intended to summarize the material information and factors
considered by the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) in
their consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger. The Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) reached
the decision to approve the entry into the Merger Agreement and recommend its adoption by the Company’s
stockholders in light of the factors described above and other factors that the Special Committee and the
QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) believed were appropriate. In view of the variety of
factors and the quality and amount of information considered, the Special Committee and the QAD Board
(other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) did not find it practicable to and did not quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching their determinations. In addition, each
of the directors of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself)
may have given different weight to different factors. The Special Committee and the QAD Board conducted
an overall review of the factors described above, including through discussions with the Company’s
management and their respective legal and financial advisors, and considered the factors overall to be
favorable to, and to support, their decisions, determinations and recommendations. It should

The Special Committee retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial
opinion in connection with the possible sale of QAD. The Special Committee selected Morgan Stanley to act
as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its knowledge of
and involvement in recent transactions in QAD’s industry, and its knowledge of QAD’s business and affairs.
At the meeting of the Special Committee on June 27, 2021, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of June 27, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received
by the Company’s stockholders (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such Company stockholders in the aggregate.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of June 27, 2021, which sets forth, among other things,
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the
review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley in
this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read
Morgan Stanley’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the Special
Committee, in its capacity as such, and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger
Consideration to be received by the Company’s stockholders (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the
aggregate pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not address the relative merits of
the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such
alternatives could be achieved or are available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a
recommendation as to how the Company’s stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting with respect to the Merger
or any other matter.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information
of QAD;
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning
QAD;
reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of QAD (as more fully defined
herein, the “Management Case”) and certain extrapolations prepared with guidance from the
management of QAD (which were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by the
management of QAD) (as more fully defined herein, the “Financial Projections”);
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of QAD with
senior executives of QAD;
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Class A Common Stock;
compared the financial performance of QAD and the prices and trading activity of the Shares with
that of certain other publicly traded companies comparable with QAD, and their securities;
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition
transactions;
participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of QAD, Parent and their
respective financial and legal advisors;
reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated as of June 27, 2021, a draft of the Equity Commitment
Letter, substantially in the form of the drafted June 26, 2021, and certain related documents; and
40 • 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors
as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made
available to Morgan Stanley by QAD and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the
Financial Projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of QAD’s management of the future financial
performance of QAD. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such Financial Projections or the
assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver,
amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among other things, that Parent will obtain
financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, and that the definitive
Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan
Stanley. In addition, Morgan Stanley understood from QAD that, pursuant to Article IV of QAD’s Certificate
of Incorporation, the holders of Class A Common Stock must receive an amount and form of consideration
per share that is no less favorable than the consideration per share received by the holders of the Class B
Common Stock in the event of a merger, business combination or consolidation of QAD, including the
Merger. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to the allocation of Merger Consideration between the Class
A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock, or the relative fairness of any portion of the Merger
Consideration to holders of any Shares. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all
the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger,
no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on
the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax
or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of QAD and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or
regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as
compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such
alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the
fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of QAD’s officers, directors or employees, or
any class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Shares
(other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the Merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent
valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of QAD, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such
valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of June 27,
2021. Events occurring after June 27, 2021 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in
preparing it, and Morgan Stanley has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with
its oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter dated June 27, 2021 to the Special Committee.
The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses
performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of
analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these
summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses
listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such
analyses and of the factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized
and relied upon (i) the Management Case and (ii) the consensus estimates of equity research analysts (the
“Street Case”). The Management Case is more fully described below in the sections of this proxy statement
captioned “- Public Trading Comparables Analysis,” “- Discounted Equity Value Analysis” and
41 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
“- Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.” In accordance with direction from the Special Committee, Morgan
Stanley utilized the Street Case and Management Case in its financial analyses described below.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value
of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and
compared certain financial estimates for QAD with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst
research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and
experience, that share similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics,
including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations,
profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the
“comparable companies”). These companies were the following:
ERP Business Model Peer Companies 
Oracle Corporation 
SAP SE 
Sage Group plc 
Financial Profile Peer Companies 
Vertex Software, LLC 
Zuora Inc. 
Alarm.com 
New Relic, Inc. 
8x8, Inc.

Vonage Holdings Corp. 
Teradata Corporation 
Global Supply Chain Peer Companies 
Manhattan Associates, Inc. 
Descartes Systems Group Inc. 
Kinaxis Inc. 
SPS Commerce, Inc. 
E2open, LLC
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to (i) estimated revenue
and (ii) EBITDA, both of which, for purposes of this analysis, (a) for QAD, (x) were provided to Morgan
Stanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use, by QAD’s management for calendar years 2021 and 2022
for the Management Case, and (y) were based on the median of publicly available equity analyst research
estimates for calendar years 2021 and 2022 for the Street Case; and (b) for each of the comparable companies,
were based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes. For
purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined “aggregate value” as a company’s fully diluted equity
value plus total debt, plus non-controlling interest, less cash and cash equivalents, and “EBITDA” as
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.
Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application
of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of (i) aggregate
value to estimated revenue multiples and (ii) aggregate value to estimated EBITDA multiples, and applied
these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant metric for QAD. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan
Stanley utilized publicly available financial information, available as of June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day
prior to the meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger).
Based on the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis as provided by QAD’s management, Morgan
Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per Share as follows:

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to QAD. In evaluating the
comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond QAD’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on QAD’s business
and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of QAD and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical
analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using
comparable company data.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the
potential future equity value of a company as a function of such company’s estimated future revenue and
EBITDA. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied
present value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity
values per Share on a standalone basis for each of the Street Case and Management Case.
To calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized (i) calendar year 2023
revenue estimates and (ii) calendar year 2023 EBITDA estimates under each of the Street Case and
Management Case, respectively. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,
Morgan Stanley applied a forward range of aggregate value to (i) estimated revenue multiples, and (ii)
EBITDA multiples (based on the range of aggregate value to revenue and EBITDA multiples for the
comparable companies) to these revenue and EBITDA estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future
implied fully diluted equity value.
In each case, Morgan Stanley then added net cash to QAD’s future implied aggregate value to reach a future
implied fully diluted equity value. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future implied fully diluted
equity value by estimated fully diluted shares outstanding (with such estimates provided by QAD
management) to calculate a per share price. Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future
share price to June 30, 2021, at a discount rate of 8.1%, which rate was selected based on QAD’s estimated
cost of equity, which was arrived at by applying the capital asset pricing model, to calculate the discounted
fully diluted equity value.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of
a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such
company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per Share based on a discounted
cash flow analysis to value QAD as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the Street
Case and Management Case for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described
below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as EBITDA less (1)
stock-based compensation expense, (2) cash taxes, (3) capital expenditures, and plus or minus changes in net
working capital. Each of the Street Case and Management Case included extrapolations through calendar
year 2030 prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by QAD’s management. The
free cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a mid-year convention, to present values as of
June 30, 2021, at a discount rate ranging from 7.1% to 9.1%, which discount rates were selected, upon the
application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of QAD’s
weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the capital asset pricing model. Morgan
Stanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0% as part of its analyses, with such rates selected upon
the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value
was then adjusted for net cash and further adjusted for the net present value of net operating losses.
Based on the outstanding Share on a fully diluted basis as provided by QAD’s management, Morgan Stanley
calculated the estimated implied value per Share as follows:

Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of
a company based on publicly available financial terms. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable
transactions because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, most notably because they were
similar software transactions. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value
of the transaction to (i) the estimated next twelve (12) months’ (which we refer to as “NTM”) revenue, and (ii)
the NTM EBITDA, each based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of each such
transaction.

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics and time frame for each of the transactions listed above and
upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative
ranges of the aggregate value to the (i) estimated NTM revenue multiples of the transactions and (ii)
estimated NTM EBITDA multiples of the transactions, and applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated
calendar year 2021 NTM revenue and NTM EBITDA, respectively, based on the Street Case. The following

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to QAD or the Merger.
In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond QAD’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of
competition on QAD’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of QAD and the industry, and in the
financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate
value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the range of implied present value per share of QAD derived from the valuation of precedent transactions
were less than or greater than the Merger Consideration is not necessarily dispositive in connection with
Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the Merger, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley
considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial
analysis with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Special Committee,
including the following information described under the sections of this proxy statement captioned “-
Illustrative Precedent Premiums,” “- Historical Trading Ranges” and “- Equity Research Analysts’ Future
Price Targets.”
Illustrative Precedent Premiums
Morgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent premiums analysis by reviewing the same sets of
comparable transactions as under the Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis. For these transactions,
Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (1) the implied
premium to the acquired company’s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the
last trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news);
(2) the implied premium to the acquired company’s thirty (30)-trading-day average closing share price prior to
announcement (or the last thirty (30)-trading-day average closing share price prior to the share price being
affected by acquisition rumors or similar Merger-related news); and (3) the implied premium to the acquired
company’s fifty two (52)-week high closing share price prior to announcement.
Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional
judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range of premia and applied such range
to QAD’s closing share price of Class A Common Stock on June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the
meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger).

Stock. Morgan Stanley reviewed a range of closing prices of the Class A Common Stock for various periods
ending on June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms.
Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the
Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger). Morgan

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for Class A Common Stock prepared
and published by equity research analysts prior to June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to
46 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger). These targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of the future
public market trading price of Class A Common Stock. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for
the Class A Common Stock was $75.00 to $82.00 per share as of May 26, 2021 to May 27, 2021. Morgan
Stanley discounted the range of analyst price targets per share of Class A Common Stock by one (1) year at a
rate of 8.1%, which discount rate was selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional
judgment and experience, to reflect QAD’s cost of equity. This analysis indicated an implied range of fully
diluted equity values for shares of Class A Common Stock of $69.38 to $75.85 per share, as discounted by
one (1) year based on undiscounted analyst price targets, as of June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day prior
to the meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt the

Preliminary Presentations by Morgan Stanley
In addition to its June 27, 2021 opinion and presentation to the Special Committee and the underlying
financial analyses performed in relation thereto, Morgan Stanley also delivered preliminary presentation
materials to the Special Committee on June 25, 2021 (the “Preliminary Presentation Materials”). The
preliminary financial considerations and other information in the Preliminary Presentation Materials were
based on information and data that was available as of the date of such presentation. The Preliminary
Presentation Materials delivered at the QAD Board meeting on June 25, 2021 substantively reflected the
analyses described above under “- Summary of Financial Analyses.” A copy of such Preliminary
Presentation Materials has been filed as an exhibit to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection
with the Merger, will be made available for inspection and copying at the principal executive offices of QAD
during its regular business hours by any interested holder of Shares, and may be obtained by requesting it in
writing from QAD at the address described in the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
The Preliminary Presentation Materials were for discussion purposes only and did not present any findings
or make any recommendations or constitute an opinion of Morgan Stanley with respect to the fairness of the
Merger Consideration or otherwise. The financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in relation to its
opinion dated June 27, 2021, as described above under “- Summary of Financial Analyses,” superseded all
analyses and information presented in the Preliminary Presentation Materials.
General
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley performed a variety
of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting
any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of
the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various
assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual
value of QAD.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond QAD’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on
QAD’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition and prospects of QAD and the industry, and in the financial markets in

TABLE OF CONTENTS
general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future
results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such
estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a
financial point of view of the Merger Consideration to be received by the Company’s stockholders (other
than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the aggregate pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in
connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of June 27, 2021 to the Special Committee. These
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which Shares might actually trade.
The Merger Consideration to be received by the Company’s stockholders (other than the holders of the
Excluded Shares) in the aggregate pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm’s-length
negotiations between QAD and Parent and was approved by the Special Committee. Morgan Stanley
provided advice to the Special Committee during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any
specific consideration to QAD or the Special Committee, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did
not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or
other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s
opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how the
Company’s stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Special Committee was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Special Committee to recommend that the QAD Board approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
opinion of the Special Committee with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of
whether the Special Committee would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.
The Special Committee selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s
qualifications, expertise and reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in QAD’s
industry, and its knowledge of QAD’s business and affairs. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm
engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its
securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange,
commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing
and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest
on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may
trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their
customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of QAD, Parent, TB UGP and their respective affiliates, or any
other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative
instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee financial advisory
services and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex D, in
connection with the Merger, and QAD has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $27 million
for its services, $3 million of which has been paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section
and attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and the remainder of which is contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger. QAD has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including
fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In
addition, QAD has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its
affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan
Stanley’s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
In the two (2) years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have
provided financial advisory and financing services for TB UGP and certain of its affiliates and their affiliated
funds’ respective portfolio companies (collectively, the “Thoma Bravo Related Entities”), and have received
aggregate fees of approximately $25 to $35 million in connection with such services. Neither

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Morgan Stanley nor any of its affiliates have been engaged in any financial advisory or financing
assignments for QAD, and have received any fees for such services from QAD during the two (2) years prior
to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and
financing services to QAD, Parent, TB UGP and Thoma Bravo Related Entities and their respective affiliates
in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.",54,63
QAD INC_20210909_DEFM14A_19523541_4291901.Pdf,Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger,"Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger
Under a possible interpretation of the SEC rules governing “going private” transactions, the Parent Entities
may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and engaged in a “going private” transaction and, therefore,
may be required to express their beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to the Company’s Unaffiliated
Stockholders. The Parent Entities are making the statements included in this section solely for purposes of
complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules and regulations under the Exchange Act.
However, the view of the Parent Entities as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a
recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement. The Parent Entities have interests in the Merger that are different from, and in
addition to, those of the other stockholders of the Company.
The Parent Entities did not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the QAD Board (other
than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) regarding, nor receive advice from the respective legal or other
advisors of the Special Committee or the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) as to, the
fairness of the Merger. The Parent Entities have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform,
any valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the Company’s
Unaffiliated Stockholders. Based on, among other things, the factors considered by, and the analysis and
resulting conclusions of, the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) and the Special
Committee discussed in “- Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the
QAD Board and the Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger”  (which analysis and resulting conclusions
the Parent Entities adopt), the Parent Entities believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the Company’s
Unaffiliated Stockholders. In particular, the Parent Entities considered the following:
the fact that no member of the Company’s senior management other than Ms. Lopker, Mr. Chilton and
Mr. Lender has a substantial financial interest in the Merger that is different from, or in addition to,
the interests of the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders generally, although the Merger Agreement
does include customary provisions for indemnity and the continuation of liability insurance for the
Company’s officers and directors;
the fact that the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself)
unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the
Company’s stockholders;
the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, thus allowing stockholders (other than the Lopker
Entities) to immediately realize a certain and fair value for their Shares, which value represents a
significant premium over the closing price of the Shares on the last trading day before the Company
publicly announced the Merger;
the fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders without
the delays that would otherwise be necessary in order to liquidate the positions of larger holders, and
without incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with market sales; and
• 
• 
the fact that there are no unusual requirements or conditions to the Merger and that the Merger is not
conditioned on any financing being obtained by Parent, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will
be consummated and that the consideration to be paid to the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders in
the Merger will be received.
The Parent Entities further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the Company’s Unaffiliated
Stockholders based upon, among other things, the following factors:
the fact that the Special Committee, consisting solely of directors who are not officers or employees
of the Company and who are not affiliated with the Parent Entities or the Lopker Entities, and who

have no financial interest in the Merger different from, or in addition to, the Company’s Unaffiliated
Stockholders generally (other than as described in “Special Factors - Interests of Executive Officers
and Directors of the Company in the Merger”), was given exclusive authority to, among other things,
review, evaluate and negotiate the terms of the Merger, to determine the advisability of the Merger, to
decide not to engage in the Merger, and to consider alternatives to the Merger;
the fact that the Special Committee was formed at the outset of Company’s consideration of a
potential transaction and prior to any consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger;
the fact that the Special Committee was fully informed about the extent to which the interests of the
Lopker Entities in the Merger differed from those of the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders;
the fact that the Special Committee conducted an extensive process, including frequent and extensive
deliberations and negotiations, and retained and was advised by independent, nationally recognized
financial and legal advisors;
the fact that the QAD Board was not permitted to recommend any potential transaction or any
alternative thereto for approval by the Company’s stockholders or otherwise approve any proposed
transaction or any alternative thereto without a prior favorable recommendation of such proposed
transaction or alternative thereto by the Special Committee;
the fact that the Special Committee was deliberate in its process and ran a thorough, open and
competitive process and evaluated various alternatives;
that the Special Committee had no obligation to recommend any transaction, including a transaction
with Parent, and that the Special Committee had the authority to reject any proposals made by Parent
or any other person;
the fact that representatives of the Company contacted a large number of potential financial and
strategic acquirors in the sale process;
the fact that the Merger Consideration was the result of the Special Committee’s extensive arm’s-
length negotiations with Parent;
the fact that the closing of the Merger is conditioned on the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of all outstanding
Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single class and (ii) a majority of the voting power of all
outstanding Shares, voting as a single class, that are not owned, beneficially or of record, by the
Lopker Entities, their respective affiliates, or any executive officer or director of the Company;
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to provide
information to, or participate in discussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding other
proposals;
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to terminate
the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement related to a Company Superior Proposal,
subject to paying Parent a Company Termination Fee of  $59,000,000 in cash, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and
the availability of appraisal rights to the Company’s stockholders (other than the Lopker Entities)
who comply with all of the required procedures under Delaware law for exercising appraisal rights,
which allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Shares.
The Parent Entities also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the
substantive and procedural fairness of the proposed Merger, including:
that the stockholders of the Company (other than the Lopker Entities) will not participate in any
future earnings or growth of the Company’s business and will not benefit from any potential sale to a
third party in the future, or from any appreciation in the Company’s value;
the risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all;

that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with essentially no assets other than the
equity and funding commitments of TB Fund XIV;
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the Merger,
which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise and
certain other actions it might otherwise take with respect to the operations of the Company pending
completion of the Merger;
the potential negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger,
could have on the Company’s business and relationships with its employees, vendors and
customers;
that the Company and its subsidiaries are restricted from soliciting, initiating, or encouraging the
submission of alternative acquisition proposals from third parties or the making of any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal;
the possibility that the amounts that may be payable by the Company upon the termination of the
Merger Agreement, including payment to Parent of a Company Termination Fee of $59,000,000 in cash,
and the processes required to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the opportunity for Parent
to make revisions to its Merger proposal, could discourage other potential acquirors from making a
competing bid to acquire the Company; and
the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to the Company’s stockholders (other than the
Lopker Entities with respect to their Rollover Shares) that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
The Parent Entities did not consider the liquidation value of the Company because they considered the
Company to be a viable, going concern that will continue to operate its business following the Merger.
Therefore, the Parent Entities did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant methodology. The Parent
Entities did not seek to determine a pre-Merger going concern value for the Shares to determine the fairness
of the Merger Consideration to the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders because, following the Merger, the
Company will have a significantly different capital structure. The Parent Entities note that the Merger
Consideration of $87.50 in cash per Share is higher than the net book value of the Company per Share of
$6.43 as of April 30, 2021. However, to the extent the pre-Merger going concern value was reflected in the
pre-announcement per Share price of the Shares, the per Share Merger Consideration of $87.50 represented a
premium to the going concern value of the Company. The Parent Entities were not aware of any firm offer for
a merger, sale of all or a substantial part of the Company’s assets, or a purchase of a controlling amount of
the Company securities having been received by the Company from anyone other than a filing person in the
two (2) years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Parent Entities
in connection with the fairness of the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all
material factors considered by them. The Parent Entities did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or
otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their conclusion as to the fairness of
the Merger. Rather, the Parent Entities reached their position as to the fairness of the Merger after
considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The Parent Entities believe these factors provide a reasonable
basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the Company’s Unaffiliated
Stockholders. This position should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Company
stockholder to approve the Merger Agreement. The Parent Entities make no recommendation as to how
stockholders of the Company should vote their Shares relating to the Merger.
None of the Parent Entities participated in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the QAD Board
(other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) regarding, nor received advice from the respective legal or
other advisors of the Special Committee or the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) as
to, the fairness of the Merger to the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders. Based on the Parent Entities’
knowledge and analysis of available information regarding the Company, as well as discussions with
members of the Company’s senior management regarding the Company and its business and the factors
considered by, and findings of, the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who
recused herself) and discussed in this proxy statement in the section entitled “- Purpose and Reasons of the
Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the QAD Board and the Special Committee; Fairness of the
Merger,” the Parent Entities believe that the Merger is fair to the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders.

Under a possible interpretation of the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, each of the Parent
Entities may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, required to express their reasons for
the Merger to the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders, as defined in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act. The
Parent Entities are making the statements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying with
the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. For the Parent Entities, the primary
purpose of the Merger is to allow Parent to own equity interests in the Company and to bear the rewards and
risks of such ownership after the Merger is completed and the Shares cease to be publicly traded. The Parent
Entities believe that structuring the transaction in such manner is preferable to other transaction structures
because it (i) will enable Parent to acquire all of the Shares at the same time, (ii) will allow the Company to
cease to be a publicly registered and reporting company, and (iii) represents an opportunity for the
Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) to receive the Merger
Consideration of $87.50 per Share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, subject
to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The Parent Entities did not
consider any other alternative transaction structures or other alternative means to accomplish the foregoing
purposes.",66,66

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, Pamela M. Lopker and the other Lopker Entities
may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, required to express their beliefs as to the
fairness of the proposed Merger to the Unaffiliated Stockholders of the Company. The Merger is the Rule
13e-3 transaction for which a Schedule 13E-3 Transaction Statement has been filed with the SEC. As
described below, the Lopker Entities believe that the Merger is fair to the Company’s Unaffiliated
Stockholders on the basis of the factors described under “Special Factors - Purpose and Reasons of the
Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the QAD Board and the Special Committee; Fairness of the
Merger”; “Special Factors - Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger.” Ms. Lopker
did not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the QAD Board regarding the Merger, and
did not receive advice from the legal or other advisors of the Company or the Special Committee as to the
fairness of the Merger. As disclosed under “Special Factors - Interests of Executive Officers and Directors
of the Company in the Merger,” the Lopker Entities have interests in the Merger both the same as those of
the Unaffiliated Stockholders of the Company by virtue of the expected receipt of the per Share Merger
Consideration for a portion of the Lopker Entities’ equity interests in the Company upon completion of the
Merger, and not identical to those of the Unaffiliated Stockholders of the Company by virtue of the Lopker
Entities’ ability to rollover a portion of their ownership stake in the Company (such rollover being valued
with the same per Share valuation of the Company’s Shares used to determine the Merger Consideration) in
exchange for a continuing ownership stake in Parent and a right for Ms. Lopker to serve as one of its
directors.
The Unaffiliated Stockholders of the Company were represented by the Special Committee, which negotiated
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement on their behalf, with the assistance of the Special
Committee’s independent legal and financial advisors. Although Ms. Lopker engaged Moelis & Company
LLC as her financial advisor in connection with the Merger, Moelis has not performed any valuation or other
analysis for the purpose of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders.
The Merger was approved by the directors of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself).

Following completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will have been merged with and into the Company, with the
Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Shares of the Company are
currently listed on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act. Following completion of the Merger,
there will be no further market for the Shares and, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and

deregistered under the Exchange Act.
The Parent Entities currently anticipate that the Company’s operations initially will be conducted following
completion of the Merger substantially as they are currently being conducted (except that the Company will
cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent). The Parent Entities

all other conditions to the Closing of the Merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and
the following will occur.
Treatment of the Shares
At the Effective Time of the Merger, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger (other than the Excluded Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, whereupon all such Shares will cease to be outstanding and
shall cease to exist, and the holders of such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other
than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right to receive dividends and other distributions,
in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards
Vested Company SARs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each Vested Company SAR, will be cancelled
and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
aggregate number of Shares subject to such Vested Company SAR multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable per Share base price of such Vested Company SAR, subject to any
required withholding of taxes. Amounts payable in respect of the cancelled Vested Company SARs will be
paid promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case later than five (5) days following
the Effective Time of the Merger).
Unvested Company SARs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding Unvested Company SAR
will be cancelled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the

the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per Share base price of such Unvested
Company SAR, and such amount will be payable in accordance with such Unvested Company SAR’s vesting
terms, subject to any required withholding of taxes.

If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders or if the Merger is not
completed for any other reason, the Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their Shares in
connection with the Merger. Instead, unless the Company is sold to a third party, the Company will
56 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
remain an independent public company, and the Shares will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq,
so long as the Company continues to meet the applicable listing requirements. In addition, if the Merger is
not completed, the Company expects that management will operate the Company’s business in a manner
similar to that in which it is being operated today and that the Company’s stockholders will continue to be
subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject. There is no assurance as to
the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your Shares, including the risk that the
market price of Shares may decline to the extent that the current market price of Shares reflects a market
assumption that the Merger will be completed.
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, the Company would be required to pay Parent a

Except for annual and quarterly guidance, the Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose
forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other results due to the inherent uncertainty,
unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions, estimates and projections. In connection
with its consideration of the Company’s stand-alone prospects and potential strategic transactions available
to the Company, management of the Company prepared and provided to the Special Committee and Morgan
Stanley financial forecasts (the “projections”). The Company’s management subsequently directed Morgan
Stanley to use the projections in connection with rendering its fairness opinion to the Special Committee and
performing its related financial analysis, as described above under the heading “- Opinion of Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC.” The summary of the projections is included in this proxy statement solely to give the
Company’s stockholders access to certain financial projections that were made available to the Special
Committee and Morgan Stanley. The summary of the projections may not be appropriate for other purposes
and is not being included in this proxy statement to influence a Company stockholder’s decision whether to
vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger.
The projections were prepared by our management for internal use. The projections were not prepared with a
view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with GAAP (as detailed below), the
published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections, the use of non-GAAP financial measures or the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective
financial information, but, in the view of the Company’s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis,
reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation and presented as of the time
of preparation, to the best of the Company’s management’s knowledge and belief, the reasonable projections
of the future financial performance of the Company.
Neither the Company’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled,
examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained
herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its
achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial
information.
The projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables
and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of the Company’s
management. Because the projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they also become subject to
greater uncertainty with each successive year. A number of important factors with respect to the Company’s
business and the industry in which it participates may affect actual results and result in the projections not
being achieved. For a description of some of these factors, the Company’s stockholders are urged to review
the Company’s most recent SEC filings as well as the discussion entitled “Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” and other risk factors described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended January 31, 2021, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.
In addition, the projections may be affected by the Company’s inability to achieve strategic goals, objectives
and targets over the applicable period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results
are indicative of the future performance of the Company or that actual results will not differ materially from
those presented in the prospective financial information.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The inclusion of the projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the
Company or any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives considered or considers the
projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the projections should not be relied
upon as such. Neither the Company nor any of its respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or
representatives has made or makes any representation to any of the Company’s stockholders or any other
person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the
projections or can give any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the projections, and
none of them undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the date the projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future
events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in
error. The Company does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the
projections, except as otherwise required by law.
The projections include non-GAAP financial measures, and they were presented because management
believed they could be useful indicators of the Company’s projected future operating performance. The
Company prepared the projections on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP,
and non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled
amounts used by other companies. As used herein, “GAAP” means generally accepted accounting
principles.
All financial projections are forward looking statements. These and other forward looking statements are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the risks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary
statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021,
and subsequent quarterly and current reports on Form 10-Q and 8-K. Please consider carefully the
discussion entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Information” elsewhere in the
proxy statement.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the projections, the Company’s stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the projections.
The following is a summary of the projections (unaudited):

For the purposes of the financial analyses as described above under the heading “- Opinion of Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC,” fiscal year projections are treated as the prior calendar year projections (e.g.,
FY2022E (ended January) is equivalent to CY2021E (ended December)).
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from other
companies and excludes the following items: interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
restructuring, separation, transaction and integration-related cost and other non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA differs from Reported Adjusted EBITDA because Reported Adjusted EBITDA does
not include expenses associated with stock-based compensation.",71,72

In considering the recommendations of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) with
respect to the Merger, the Company’s stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors
have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the
Company’s stockholders generally. The Special Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, and
the QAD Board were aware of these interests and considered the interests described below, among other
matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger and in making its recommendations.
Special Committee Fees
Each of the members of the Special Committee, consisting of directors who are not directly or indirectly
affiliated with, and who are otherwise independent from, Ms. Lopker and who are not members
58 
(1)
(2)TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the Company’s management or otherwise interested in the Merger, will receive a fee of $20,000 per month
for each month that the Special Committee is in effect, beginning in March 2021, in connection with their
services to the Company with respect to the Merger (which fee is not conditioned on the consummation of
the Merger). The fees to members of the Special Committee are expected to total between $500,000 and
$600,000.
Payments to Executive Officers in Respect of Equity Awards
Upon the Effective Time of the Merger, each Company SAR, Company RSU and Company PSU will be
converted into the right to receive cash payments based upon the Merger Consideration as described below.
As of September 7, 2021, the Company’s executive officers hold 902,500 vested Company SARs, 47,500
unvested Company SARs, 199,374 Company RSUs, and 94,872 Company PSUs. For certain named executive
officers, 50% of the previously granted, unvested, equity-based compensation for such named executive
shall vest immediately upon a change in control.
Vested Company SARs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each Vested Company SAR, will be cancelled
and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
aggregate number of Shares subject to such Vested Company SAR multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable per Share base price of such Vested Company SAR, subject to any
required withholding of taxes. Amounts payable in respect of the cancelled Vested Company SARs will be
paid promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case later than five (5) days following
the Effective Time of the Merger).
Unvested Company SARs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding Unvested Company SAR
will be cancelled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (A) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Unvested Company SAR multiplied by (B)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per Share base price of such Unvested
Company SAR, and such amount will be payable in accordance with such Unvested Company SAR’s vesting
terms.
Vested Company RSUs and Vested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each (i) Vested
Company RSU and (ii) Vested Company PSU will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of Shares subject to the Vested
Company RSU and/or Vested Company PSU (with Company PSUs granted in 2019 earned based on actual
performance achieved through the Effective Time and Company PSUs granted in 2021 deemed earned at
100% of target level of performance), multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration, subject to any required
withholding of taxes. Amounts payable in respect of the cancelled Vested Company RSUs and cancelled
Vested Company PSUs will be paid promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case later
than five (5) days following the Effective Time of the Merger). For purposes of clarity, 50% of the Company
RSUs and Company PSUs held by each of Anton Chilton, Pamela M. Lopker and Daniel Lender that are
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger will vest in accordance with the terms
of their respective CIC Agreement (as defined below) and will be treated as Vested Company RSUs and
Vested Company PSUs and payable promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger.
Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each tranche
of Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs will be cancelled and replaced with a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the amount of the Merger Consideration multiplied
by (B) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company
PSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (with Company PSUs granted in 2019 earned
based on actual performance achieved through the Effective Time of the Merger and Company PSUs granted
in 2021 deemed earned at 100% of target level of performance) (the “Cash Replacement Company RSU/PSU
Amounts”).
For each tranche of cancelled Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs, except as otherwise
provided by the terms of the Merger Agreement, 50% of the Cash Replacement Company RSU/​PSU Amounts,
subject to any required withholding of taxes, will be paid promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger
(and in no case later than five (5) days following the Effective Time of the Merger).
59 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Except as otherwise provided by the terms of the Merger Agreement, the remaining 50% of the Cash
Replacement Company RSU/PSU Amounts for each tranche of cancelled Unvested Company RSUs and
Unvested Company PSUs will vest, subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates
(including the surviving Company and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, subject to any
required withholding of taxes, at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company PSUs
for which such Cash Replacement Company RSU/PSU Amount were exchanged, would have vested pursuant
to their terms or upon an earlier qualifying termination of employment by the Company without cause or a
resignation by the holder for good reason (as described in the Merger Agreement).
For purposes of clarity and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding
paragraph, 50% of the Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by each of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr.
Lender that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger will be treated as
Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs and will be converted into the Cash Replacement
Company RSU/PSU Amounts as described above; however, such amounts will vest and be payable in
accordance with the terms of their respective CIC Agreement (i.e., will be paid on the first anniversary of the
Closing, or, the earlier of the regular vesting date applicable to such award and the date the named executive
officer’s employment is terminated either by the Company without “cause” or a resignation by the named
executive officer due to a “constructive termination”  (in each case, as defined in the CIC Agreements)) and
as provided by the terms of the Merger Agreement.
For an estimate of the amount payable to each of the Company’s named executive officers in respect of such
unvested equity-based awards on the closing date of the Merger, assuming the closing date of the Merger
was September 7, 2021 for these purposes, see “- Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the
Company in the Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation” below.
The table below also sets forth the total number of Shares and number of Shares subject to equity-based
awards determined as described above and below, per individual, expected to be held on the closing date of
the Merger, assuming (i) the closing date of the Merger was September 7, 2021 and (ii) the number of
outstanding Shares and equity-based awards for each director and executive officer on the closing of the
Merger were equal to the number of Shares and equity-based awards that were outstanding as of September
7, 2021, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement (such
numbers do not forecast any grants, any vesting, additional issuances, dividends, additional deferrals or
forfeitures of equity-based awards following the date of this proxy statement). For purposes of these
estimates, the number of Shares owned and Shares subject to Company RSUs and Company PSUs were
multiplied by the per Share Merger Consideration of $87.50, and the number of Shares subject to Company
SARs were multiplied by the difference between the per Share Merger Consideration of $87.50 and the
applicable per Share base price.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Number of Shares subject to outstanding Company PSUs is calculated as 0% of the target number of
Shares for the third tranche of the 2019 Company PSU grants (based upon anticipated performance
achievement in fiscal year 2022), 121.6% of the target number of Shares for the second tranche of the
2020 Company PSU grants (based upon actual performance achievement in fiscal year 2021) and 100% of
the target number of Shares for 2021 Company PSU grants.
On June 21, 2021, as disclosed in a Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on April 29, 2021, Mr.
Roberts’s term on the QAD Board (and therefore Special Committee) ended pursuant to the term set
forth in the bylaws of the Company, and he did not stand for reelection.
Change in Control Agreements; Change in Control Policy
The Company has previously (i) entered into change in control agreements, approved by the Company’s
Compensation Committee, with Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender (the “CIC Agreements”), which
provide certain benefits to such executive officers in the event of a change in control (as defined in the CIC
Agreements) and (ii) adopted a Change in Control Policy designed to cover a limited number of Company
individuals whose positions and titles are defined as Company President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, other members of the Company’s executive committee, Vice
Presidents and other individuals, in each case, as are specifically approved by the Company’s Compensation
Committee for inclusion under such policy. Ms. Kara L. Bellamy does not have a CIC Agreement and was not
previously approved to be included in the Company’s Change in Control Policy; however, following
negotiations among the Parent Entities, the Company and the Special Committee, and pursuant to the terms
of the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee approved and the Parent has agreed to cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to all employees with a title of Vice President or above who also do not have a CIC
Agreement and were not previously approved to be included in the Company’s Change in Control Policy
(including Ms. Bellamy) with change in control severance payments and benefits after a qualifying
involuntary termination of employment, as described below, consistent with the terms of the Company’s
Change in Control Policy.
The terms of the CIC Agreements are substantially the same, each providing cash severance, accelerated
vesting of certain previously granted, unvested, equity-based compensation and cash payments in lieu of
continuation of benefits coverage. The CIC Agreements provide a gross-up for any excise taxes that the
executive officers may incur under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”) if the amounts they receive would constitute “excess parachute payments”  (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder).
The CIC Agreement for each of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender provides that 50% of the previously
granted, unvested, equity-based compensation for the named executive vests immediately upon a change in
control. Subject to the accelerated vesting benefit described below, the remaining unvested equity awards
will vest upon the earlier of (i) the original vesting date or (ii) the first anniversary date of the change in
control, provided the named executive remains employed by the Company as of the relevant vesting date. All
of the other change in control benefits provided under the CIC Agreements are considered “double trigger,”
meaning that the payment of cash severance, accelerated vesting of the remaining 50% of the previously
granted, unvested, equity-based compensation prior to the first anniversary date of the change in control
and cash in lieu of continuation of benefits require both a “change in control” of the Company and the
termination of the named executive’s employment by the Company without “cause” or a resignation by the
named executive officer due to a “constructive termination”  (in each case, as defined in the CIC Agreements)
within eighteen (18) months following a change in control. The Merger will constitute a “change in control”
as defined in the CIC Agreements. Upon occurrence of such termination of employment, each of the CIC
Agreements provides for the following:
a lump sum payment equal to eighteen (18) months times the base monthly salary of the named
executive at the greater of: (a) the rate in effect at the time of the change in control or (b) the rate in
effect at the time of termination of employment;
a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times the greater of: (a) the average annual bonus paid in the two (2)
fiscal years prior to termination of employment or (b) the target bonus for the year of such termination
of employment;

immediate vesting of any unvested equity compensation; and
a cash payment equivalent to the present value of the projected cost of continuation of all employee
benefits and perquisites, including life insurance, health benefits, disability insurance, cars and
expense reimbursement, and 401(k) matching payments for a period of eighteen (18) months following
termination, plus an amount equal to the portion of the named executive’s unvested 401(k) account
balance that would vest if the named executive had eighteen (18) additional months of service for
vesting purposes under our 401(k) plan.
As a condition to the receipt of the payments and benefits under the CIC Agreements, each of Mr. Chilton,
Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants for the one (1) year
period following their termination of employment, which include a non-compete, a non-solicit of employees,
non-interference with the Company’s relationship with its employees or customers, and non-disparagement
of the Company.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Company’s Change in Control Policy, Ms. Bellamy would
be entitled to receive the payments and benefits outlined below if her employment is terminated by the
Company without “cause” or she resigns following a “change in status”  (in each case, as defined in the
Change in Control Policy) during the twelve (12) months following a change in control. The Merger will
constitute a “change in control” as defined in the Change in Control Policy. Upon occurrence of such
termination of employment, Ms. Bellamy will receive:
a payment equal to twelve (12) months of her base compensation. Under the Change in Control
Policy, compensation base is defined as an executive’s highest fiscal year base salary in effect within
two (2) years prior to the change in control;
a payment equal to one times her average annual bonus. Under the Change in Control Policy, average
annual bonus is defined as an executive’s average annual bonus for the two (2) full fiscal years
immediately preceding the change in control;
accelerated vesting of any outstanding equity compensation awards granted under the Company’s
equity incentive plans; and
a payment equal to twelve (12) months benefits replacement. The benefits replacement payment is
intended to compensate the executive for employee benefits being received at the time of the
executive’s termination of employment.
For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable under
the CIC Agreements and the Change in Control Policy to the named executive officers, see “- Golden
Parachute Compensation” below.
Indemnification Benefits
Each of the Company’s executive officers and directors are entitled to the indemnification benefits in favor of
the Company’s directors and executive officers, as described in more detail in “The Merger Agreement - 
Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.”
Golden Parachute Compensation
The table below, titled “Potential Change-in-Control Payments to Named Executive Officers,” along with its
footnotes, sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation
payable to the Company’s named executive officers as determined for purposes of our most recent annual
proxy statement, which compensation is subject to the non-binding, advisory, affirmative vote of a majority
of the Shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon,
as described below in “Merger Related Executive Compensation Arrangements (The Golden Parachute
Proposal - Proposal 2).” Our named executive officers for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, included
Anton Chilton, Chief Executive Officer, Pamela M. Lopker, President, Daniel Lender, Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer and Kara L. Bellamy, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief
Accounting Officer. The table assumes the consummation of the Merger occurred on September 7, 2021, and
the employment of the named executive officer was terminated by the Company without

“cause” or by the named executive officer following a “constructive termination” or “change in status,”
applicable, on such date. The value of any equity-based awards was calculated by multiplying the number of
the Shares subject to Company RSUs and Company PSUs by the per Share Merger Consideration of $87.50
and by multiplying the number of the Shares subject to Company SARs by the difference between the per
Share Merger Consideration of $87.50 and the applicable Company SAR per Share base price.
The calculations in the table below do not include amounts that the Company’s named executive officers
were already entitled to receive or vested in as of the date hereof or amounts under contracts, agreements,
plans or arrangements to the extent they do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of
executive officers and that are available generally to all the Company’s salaried employees.

As described above in “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards,” the
equity amounts consist of the accelerated vesting (in the case of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr.
Lender) and/or payment of unvested Company SARs, Company RSUs and Company PSUs. For Ms.
Bellamy, the equity amount represents the accelerated payment of 50% of her Cash Replacement
Company RSU/​PSU Amount in respect of her cancelled unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs.
The amounts shown are based on the number of such equity-based awards held by each named
executive officer as of September 7, 2021, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before
the filing of this proxy statement. Depending on when the Closing Date occurs, certain equity-based
awards may vest in accordance with their terms.
The amounts shown in this column represent the portion of the unvested equity awards that are
“single-trigger” in nature, which will become vested and/or payable immediately upon the closing date
whether or not employment is terminated.

third tranche of the 2019 Company PSU grants (based upon anticipated performance achievement in
fiscal year 2022), 121.6% of the target number of Shares for the second tranche of the 2020 Company
PSU grants (based upon actual performance achievement in fiscal year 2021) and 100% of the target
number of Shares for 2021 Company PSU grants.
As described above in “- Change in Control Agreements; Change in Control Policy,” the cash
payments to each of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender consist of a lump-sum cash payment equal
to the sum of eighteen (18) months of monthly base salary and 1.5 times the greater of: (a) the average
annual bonus paid in the two (2) fiscal years prior to termination of employment or (b) the target bonus
for the year of such termination of employment. For Ms. Bellamy, she will receive a lump-sum cash
payment equal to twelve (12) months of compensation base (i.e., highest fiscal year base salary in effect
within two (2) years prior to the change in control) and a lump-sum cash payment equal to one times her
average annual bonus for the two (2) full fiscal years immediately preceding the change in control. The
cash severance amounts shown in this column are “double-trigger” in nature, which will become
payable only if, in the case of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker, and Mr. Lender, their employment is terminated
by the Company without cause or they resign due to a constructive termination during the eighteen (18)
months following the closing, and, in the case of Ms. Bellamy, her employment is terminated by the
Company without “cause” or she resigns following a “change in status”  (in each case, as defined in the
Change in Control Policy) during the twelve (12) months following the closing.

As described above in “The Merger Agreement - The Merger; Merger Consideration - Treatment of
Equity Compensation Awards,” the equity amounts consist of the accelerated vesting and payment of
unvested Company SARs, Company RSUs and Company PSUs. The number of Shares subject to
outstanding Company PSUs is calculated as 0% of the target number of Shares for the third tranche of

held by each named executive officer as of September 7, 2021, the latest practicable date to determine
such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement. The amounts shown do not attempt to forecast
any grants, additional issuances, dividends, additional deferrals or forfeitures of equity-based awards
following the date of this proxy statement. Depending on when the closing date occurs, certain equity-
based awards will vest in accordance with their terms.
The amounts shown in this column represent the portion of the unvested equity awards that are “double-

For each of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender, the cash payments included in this column (4)
represent the present value of the projected cost of continuation of all employee benefits and
perquisites, including life insurance, health benefits, disability insurance, cars and expense
reimbursement, and 401(k) matching payments for a period of eighteen (18) months following
termination of employment, plus an amount equal to the portion of the named executive’s unvested
401(k) account balance that would vest if the named executive had eighteen (18) additional months of
service for vesting purposes under our 401(k) plan. For Ms. Bellamy, the cash payment included in
column (4) represents a payment equal to twelve (12) months benefit replacement, which is intended to
compensate her for employee benefits being received at time of her termination of employment. The
amounts reflected in this column (4) are to be paid in a lump sum and are “double-trigger” in nature as
they will become payable only if, in the case of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker, and Mr. Lender, their
employment is terminated by the Company without cause or they resign due to a constructive
termination during the eighteen (18) months following the closing, and, in the case of Ms. Bellamy, her
employment is terminated by the Company without cause or she resigns following a change in status
during the twelve (12) months following the closing.
Under the CIC Agreements, the Company will provide full tax gross-up payments to each of Mr. Chilton,
Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender for any excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code with respect to
excess parachute payments. The amount of any excise tax and related gross-up payment for any named
executive officer, will depend on the actual closing date of the Merger, and the timing of termination of
employment, if any. The value of the tax reimbursement amount set forth in the table for Mr. Chilton (A)
assumes that (i) the Merger is consummated, and the executive’s qualifying termination of employment
occurs, on September 7, 2021, and (ii) 2021 federal and state income and other employment-related tax
rates apply, and (B) was calculated (i) using a “base amount”  (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code) based upon Mr. Chilton’s W-2 compensation for the five (5) taxable years beginning with 2016
and ending with 2020 and (ii) without taking into account the potential value of restrictive covenants to
which Mr. Chilton is subject. Accordingly, the value of the tax gross-up payment may increase or
decrease based on changes to any of the above assumptions, calculations or other variables. The tax
gross-up payment is “single trigger” in nature as a termination of employment is not required in order to
receive such benefit.
The amounts in this column represent the total of all compensation in columns (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5).
As a condition to the receipt of the payments and benefits under the CIC Agreements, each of Mr.
Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants for the one
(1) year period following their termination of employment, which include a non-compete, a non-solicit of
employees, non-interference with the Company’s relationship with its employees or customers, and non-
disparagement of the Company.
Contribution and Exchange Agreement
In addition, as is described elsewhere in this proxy statement, on June 27, 2021, the Lopker Entities
separately entered into a Contribution and Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which and immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the Lopker Entities will contribute to Ultimate Parent the Rollover Shares and, in exchange
for such Rollover Shares, Ultimate Parent will issue to the Lopker Entities the Parent Units. The Contribution
and Exchange Agreement also includes certain confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and non-
disparagement covenants applicable to Ms. Lopker and the other Lopker Entities. A copy of the Contribution
and Exchange Agreement is attached as Annex C to the accompanying proxy statement and is incorporated
by reference in the accompanying proxy statement in its entirety. See

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to
U.S. Holders (as defined below) of the Shares. This summary is general in nature and does not discuss all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of the Shares in light of their
particular circumstances. This discussion is based on the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated under
the Code, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we
refer to as the IRS, and other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, and
all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, with possible retroactive effect. We
have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and
the conclusions reached in the following discussion, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree
with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of
litigation. This discussion does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local
or non-U.S. jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation,
nor does it address any aspects of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax. In addition, this
discussion only applies to the Shares that are held as a capital asset (generally, property held for investment)
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code and does not address tax considerations applicable to any
holder of the Shares that may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, including:

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax

the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Any such partnership (including any entity
or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes), and any partners thereof, that
hold the Shares should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of exchanging the
Shares pursuant to the Merger. In addition, holders of Shares who are not U.S. Holders may be subject to
different tax consequences than those described below and are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
their tax treatment under U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws.
The following summary is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and
advice. Holders of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisor with respect to the specific tax consequences to
them of the Merger in light of their own particular circumstances, including U.S. federal estate, gift and other non-
income tax consequences, and tax consequences under state, local and non-U.S. tax laws.
U.S. Holders
The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that will
apply to U.S. Holders. For purposes of this discussion, the term U.S. Holder refers to a beneficial owner of
the Shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual who is a citizen or resident in the United States;
a corporation (or any other entity or arrangement treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust has validly elected to be treated as a “United States
person” under applicable Treasury regulations.
Exchange of the Shares for Cash Pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The exchange of the Shares by a U.S.
Holder for cash in the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A
U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash
received in the Merger and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Shares exchanged therefor. Gain or loss will
generally be determined separately for each block of the Shares (generally, the Shares acquired at the same
cost in a single transaction) held by such U.S. Holder. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss,
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Shares is more than one
(1) year at the time of the exchange. Long-term capital gains recognized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder are
generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain
limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Shares that is neither a U.S.
Holder nor an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt
of cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger unless:
the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the
United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, such gain is attributable to a
permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States);
the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or
more during the taxable year of the disposition of Shares pursuant to the Merger, and certain other
requirements are met; or
we are or have been a “U.S. real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at
any time during the shorter of the five (5) year period ending on the date of the Merger or the period
that the Non-U.S. Holder held the Shares and, in the case where the Shares are regularly traded on an
established securities market, the Non-U.S. Holder has owned, directly or constructively, more than
5% of the Shares at any time within the shorter of the five (5) year period preceding the Merger or
such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Shares. There can be no assurance that our Shares will
be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market for this purpose.
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net
income basis at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such Non-U.S.
Holder were a U.S. Holder. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits
tax at a rate of 30%, or lower rate specified in an applicable income tax treaty, on such effectively connected
gain, as adjusted for certain items.
Gain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate
of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset
by U.S.-source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a
resident of the United States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns
with respect to such losses.
Gain described in the third bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net
income basis at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such Non-U.S.
Holder were a U.S. Holder. In addition, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax at a rate of
15% of the amount realized upon such disposition. We will be classified as a United States real property
holding corporation if the fair market value of our “United States real property interests” equals or exceeds
50% of the sum of the fair market value of our worldwide real property interests plus our other assets used

or held for use in a trade or business, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Non-U.S. Holders
are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them if we are or have been a
“United States real property holding corporation.”
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax
Proceeds from the exchange of the Shares pursuant to the Merger generally will be subject to information
reporting. In addition, backup withholding tax at the applicable rate (currently 24%) generally will apply
unless the applicable U.S. Holder or other payee provides a valid taxpayer identification number and
complies with certain certification procedures (generally, by providing a properly completed IRS Form W-9)
or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding tax. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be
allowed as a credit against that holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a
refund, provided, that, the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Each U.S. Holder should duly
complete, sign and deliver to the exchange agent an appropriate IRS Form W-9 to provide the information
and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding tax, unless an exemption applies and is established
in a manner satisfactory to the exchange agent.
A Non-U.S. Holder generally certifies its status as such by providing a properly completed and signed IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-BEN-E. A Non-U.S. Holder that does not provide such form generally will be presumed
to be a U.S. Holder, subject to backup withholding tax as described above.",80,83

Equity Financing
The Merger Agreement does not contain any financing-related contingencies or financing conditions to
consummation of the Merger. In connection with the Merger, Parent delivered to the Company the Equity
Commitment Letter, dated as of the date June 27, 2021, entered into by and among TB Fund XIV and Parent.
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, TB Fund XIV has committed, subject to the terms and conditions
contained therein, to provide equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to $1,626,900,000 (the
“Commitment”) to Parent on or prior to the closing of the Merger to purchase, or cause an assignee
permitted by the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter to purchase, directly or indirectly, equity securities
of Parent, solely for the purpose of providing the financing for the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement at the Closing of the Merger, including the fees and expenses related thereto. The Commitment
represents the aggregate amount estimated to be required to fund the Required Amount, as defined in the
Merger Agreement, at the Closing.
Funding of the Commitment is subject to the conditions and limitations provided in the Equity Commitment
Letter, which include: (a) the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement; (b) the satisfaction or written
waiver by the parties, as applicable, of each of the conditions to the parties’ obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the prior or substantially concurrent satisfaction of such
conditions at the Closing), and the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Commitment is subject to reduction in the event that the full amount
of the Commitment is not necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.
The Equity Commitment letter and TB Fund XIV’s obligation to fund the Commitment will terminate
automatically and immediately upon the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation of the Closing and the
payment of the Required Amount, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
The Company is a third party beneficiary of the rights granted to Parent under the Equity Commitment Letter
(if and only if the Company is entitled to specific performance of Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to
consummate the Merger) solely for the purpose of seeking specific performance of Parent’s right to cause
the Commitment to be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter (solely to the
extent that Parent can cause the Commitment to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter).

reimbursement of the Company’s and the Company’s subsidiaries’ (y) reasonable and documented out-of-

Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the HSR Act, and
filings under similar foreign antitrust laws, and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied
and/or all applicable consents have been obtained. Notification and Report Forms were filed with the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on July 12, 2021 and the
applicable waiting period expired on 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, August 11, 2021, and the requisite regulatory
approvals were obtained, or the applicable waiting periods expired or terminated, under the antitrust laws of
certain foreign jurisdictions on August 10, 2021.
At any time before or after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to
enjoin the consummation of the Merger, conditionally approve the Merger upon the divestiture of assets of
the Company, subject the consummation of the Merger to regulatory conditions or seek other remedies. In
addition, state attorneys general and other regulators could take action under the antitrust or other laws as
they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also
seek to take legal action under the applicable laws under some circumstances. Although the parties have

Currently, the Company is aware of four (4) pending cases related to the Merger. In Nantahala Capital
Partners II L.P. v. QAD Inc., et al., a purported stockholder class action filed in Delaware Chancery Court on
July 2, 2021, the plaintiff alleges breaches of contract and fiduciary duty against directors Anton Chilton,
Scott Adelson, Kathleen Crusco, and Peter van Cuylenburg (the “Director Defendants”), and Pamela M.
Lopker, as well as a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty against Thoma Bravo and certain
affiliates of Thoma Bravo relating to the QAD Board’s vote to approve the Merger Agreement. The complaint
names the Company as a defendant to the extent necessary for any of the relief requested. Plaintiff is
seeking, among other things, to enjoin the Closing of the Merger or, in the alternative, damages, including
rescissory damages. The plaintiff claims that the Contribution and Exchange Agreement (pursuant to which
and immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Lopker Entities will contribute to Ultimate Parent the Rollover
Shares and, in exchange for such Rollover Shares, Ultimate Parent will issue to the Lopker Entities the Parent
Units) and the Merger Agreement violate Article IV, Section 2.B(d) of QAD’s corporate charter, which
provides that holders of Class A Common Stock receive per Share consideration no less favorable than that
received by any holders of Class B Common Stock in any merger. The plaintiff alleges that Ms. Lopker and
the Director Defendants breached Article IV, Section 2.B(d) of QAD’s corporate charter, that Ms. Lopker’s
participation in the separate Contribution and Exchange Agreement with Thoma Bravo breached her fiduciary
duties to the Company, that the Director Defendants’ approval of the Merger breached their fiduciary duties
to the Company, and that Thoma Bravo and its affiliates aided and abetted those breaches. In a supplement
to their complaint, filed on August 16, 2021,
72 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Plaintiff alleges that the Director Defendants and Ms. Lopker breached their fiduciary duties by
disseminating a false, misleading, and materially incomplete Proxy, and that Thoma Bravo aided and abetted
those breaches. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that the Proxy, issued on August 2, 2021, provides an inaccurate
description of the events leading to the Merger and the consideration that Ms. Lopker will receive in
connection with the Merger. The court has ordered that the case proceed on an expedited basis. The
Company believes the claims are without any merit
On August 5 and 6, 2021, purported shareholders of the Company filed two complaints in the District Court
of the Southern District of New York, captioned Stein v. QAD Inc., et. al., 1:21-cv-06856 and Whitfield v.
QAD, Inc., et. al., 1:21-cv-06674, both naming the Company and members of its board of directors as
defendants. On September 3, 2021, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a complaint in the District
Court of the Eastern District of New York, captioned Parmar v. QAD Inc., et al., 1:21-cv-04974, naming the
Company and members of its board of directors as defendants. All three actions assert federal securities
claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and related provisions for alleged failures to
disclose material information, and seek to enjoin or rescind the Merger with Thoma Bravo and a request for

If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, stockholders who continuously hold Shares
through the Effective Time, who do not vote such Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
and who properly demand appraisal of such Shares and do not effectively withdraw their demands or
otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of such Shares in connection
with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of Shares who perfect their
appraisal rights, who do not thereafter effectively withdraw their demand for appraisal, and who follow the
procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have such Shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such
Shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined
to be fair value, if any, (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Special Meeting - Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount
determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their Shares are encouraged
to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the
exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of
their Shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before
the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy with respect to, or
otherwise vote, the Shares for which you seek appraisal in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement; (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the date of the making of the demand
through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of
the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are
satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are
described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Special Meeting - Appraisal
Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex E to this
proxy statement and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. If you hold your Shares
through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal

rights, you should consult with such broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures
for the making of a demand for appraisal by such broker, bank or other nominee. For more information, please

the Merger Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the
information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the
Merger Agreement in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the Merger because it is the
principal document governing the Merger.
The Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information
regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and are not intended to provide you with any factual
information about us or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about us contained in this proxy
statement or in our public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the Merger Agreement and this summary
are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts
and circumstances relating to the Company. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement
and in the public filings we make with the SEC, as described in the section titled “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by and covenants of each of the parties to
the Merger Agreement that were made only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified
dates. Those representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the
Merger Agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with the negotiation of
the Merger Agreement (including by being qualified by confidential disclosure schedules and certain other
disclosures exchanged between the parties to the Merger Agreement, which are not reflected in the Merger
Agreement) and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality which may differ from what may be
viewed as material by you or other investors. In particular, in your review of the representations and
warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind
that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the
circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right not to close the transactions
contemplated thereby if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a
change in circumstances or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement,
rather than establishing matters as facts. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent
information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by the Company. As of the date of this
proxy statement, except as set forth in the Company’s public disclosures, there are no specific material facts
that exist that the Company believes materially contradicts its representations and warranties in the Merger
Agreement. The Company will provide additional disclosure in its public reports to the extent it becomes
aware of the existence of any specific material facts that are required to be disclosed under U.S. federal
securities laws and might contradict its representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement.
In any event, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement should not
be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy
statement and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. See the section titled “Where You Can

Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a continuing employee), other

agreement, for a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, for so long as the continuing employee
is employed by the Surviving Corporation during such period after the Effective Time, (i) base cash
compensation that is no less favorable than as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term
bonus and short-term incentive opportunities (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation) that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance
benefits to each continuing employee that are no less favorable than those under the Company benefit plans
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, but not limited to, the Company’s change in
control severance policy, and any other severance policies) or benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements
and arrangements of Parent or the Surviving Corporation as in effect at the time of termination of
employment, whichever is greater and (iv) employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than defined
benefit pension, retiree welfare, base cash compensation, short-term and long-term bonus and short-term and
long-term incentive opportunities, nonqualified deferred compensation, change in control, equity and equity-
based compensation and severance benefits) to continuing employees that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to either those provided to the continuing employees as of the date of the Merger Agreement or
those provided similarly situated employees of Parent or any of its affiliates.
Parent has agreed to take commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to permit each
continuing employee to either continue to participate from and after the Closing Date for the continuation
period in the company benefit plans (excluding any equity or equity-based arrangements or any long-term
incentive arrangements) in which such continuing employee participated immediately prior to the Closing
Date, or be eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date in benefit plans of Parent or any of its
affiliates. To the extent Parent causes a continuing employee to cease to be eligible to participate in the
Company’s benefit plan and instead provides for such continuing employee to be eligible to participate in a
replacement plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its affiliates, if any such replacement plan is a
group health plan, each participating continuing employee must be credited, for the year in which the
Closing occurs, with any deductibles and copayments already incurred during such year under the Company
benefit plan being replaced. Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation, or their affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize each continuing employee’s years of service and level of
seniority with the Company and its subsidiaries (including service and seniority with any other employer
that was recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries) for purposes of terms of employment and
eligibility, vesting and vacation benefit determination (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or eligibility for any retiree health or welfare benefit) under the replacement plans. Parent must
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each replacement plan to waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion or restriction with respect to participation and coverage requirements under a replacement plan
that is a group health plan applicable to a continuing employee for the plan year in which the Closing occurs
to the extent such exclusion or restriction did not apply with respect to such continuing employee under

entitled “No Solicitation by the Company and Company Change in Recommendation” do any or all of the

Committee, may make a Company Change in Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening Event if
(i) the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law, (ii) (A) the Company has provided Parent at least four (4) business days’ written notice prior to making
any such Company Change in Recommendation, which notice shall describe the Company Intervening Event
in reasonable detail and which notice shall not itself constitute a Company Change in Recommendation and
(B) if requested by Parent in good faith, during such four (4) business day period after providing such
notice, negotiate in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed
by Parent so that a Company Change in Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (iii) after giving
effect to the revisions contemplated by the foregoing clause (ii) if any, after consultation with financial
advisors and outside counsel, the QAD Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, has
determined in good faith that failure to make the Company Change in Recommendation in response to such
Company Intervening Event, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the QAD Board’s
fiduciary duties under applicable law. The provisions described in this paragraph also apply to any material
change in the event, occurrence or fact relating to such Company Intervening Event and require a new notice
from the Company, except that the references to periods of four (4) business days in the procedures
described in this paragraph shall be shortened to two (2) business days for such purposes.

by both the Special Committee and the QAD Board prior to the time of Company Stockholder Approval;
provided, that, (a) the receipt, existence or terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Superior
Proposal, or (b) any changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in the market price or trading volume of
the Shares or the credit rating of the Company (it being understood that the underlying cause of any of the
foregoing in this clause (b) may be considered and taken into account), in each case, shall not be deemed to
be a Company Intervening Event.
The Company has agreed that the QAD Board may not make a Company Change in Recommendation and the
Company may not terminate the Merger Agreement as described below, unless:
the Company has provided to Parent four (4) business days’ prior written notice (the “Company
Superior Proposal Notice”), which notice shall not constitute a Company Change in Recommendation,

advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and the material terms and conditions
of any such Company Superior Proposal), the identity of the person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and copies of all definitive or proposed agreements or other material documents
submitted in connection therewith;
during such four (4) business day period, if requested in writing by Parent in good faith, the
Company and its representatives engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding changes
to the terms of the Merger Agreement intended by Parent to cause such Company Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal; and
the QAD Board has considered any adjustments to the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent (the “Parent Proposed Changed Terms”) by no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the
fourth (4 ) business day of such four (4) business day period and, upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel) that the Company Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal if such Parent Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect, and that the failure
to make the Company Change in Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the
QAD Board under applicable law;
provided, however, that any (1) material revisions to the terms of a Company Superior Proposal or (2) material
revisions to a Company Acquisition Proposal that the QAD Board had determined no longer constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal, will constitute a new Company Acquisition Proposal and will in each case
require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Company Superior Proposal Notice, except that the
references to four (4) business days in the immediately preceding three (3) bullet points will be deemed to be
two (2) business days.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, at any point prior to receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval if, in response to a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal
made after the date of the Merger Agreement and not withdrawn that did not result from a material breach of
the Merger Agreement provisions in the section titled “No Solicitation by the Company and Company
Change in Recommendation,” the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel) that (i) such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to make the Company Change in Recommendation or terminate the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
QAD Board’s fiduciary obligations under applicable law, (A) subject to compliance with the requirements set
forth in the immediately preceding paragraph and bullet points, the QAD Board, upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee, may make a Company Change in Recommendation or (B) the Company may terminate
the Merger Agreement in accordance with its term in order to enter into a Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal, provided, among other conditions, the
Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee.
The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty four (24) hours after receipt) advise Parent in
writing in the event that the Company receives any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal
or request for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and
in connection with such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and conditions (including the identity of
the third party making any such Company Acquisition Proposal) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal.
The Company will (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of the status and material terms of
any such Company Acquisition Proposal (including, prior to furnishing any information or to participating in
any discussions or negotiations pursuant to the Merger Agreement, advising Parent of any determination by
the QAD Board pursuant to the Merger Agreement) and any discussions and negotiations concerning the
material terms and conditions thereof and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event
within twenty four (24) hours after receipt) any written indication of interest (or amendment thereto) or any
written material that constitutes an offer (or amendment thereto) including copies of any proposed Company
Alternative Acquisition Agreements.

Merger Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare a preliminary proxy statement and file it with the SEC and
(ii) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC a Schedule 13E-3. This proxy

any Indemnified Party that is named as a party in such proceeding, the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of, any security holder litigation or other proceeding against the Company or its
directors relating to such transactions, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the prior written

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section titled “Stockholder Litigation,” nothing will

defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, and any

Specific Performance
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of the Merger Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached by the parties. The parties have agreed that they shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or
any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger
Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware lacks jurisdiction over such matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware and the federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, without proof of damages or
otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each
party has agreed not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance and further agreed not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would
provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each party has further agreed that neither the other party
nor any other person will be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in the provision described in this paragraph, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, the parties acknowledged and agreed
that Parent has an obligation thereunder to cause the Financing to be funded, including by exercising its
rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and such obligation of Parent will be subject to the requirements
set forth in the first bullet below, and the right of the Company to specific performance in connection with
enforcing such obligation of Parent and the Company’s third party beneficiary rights under the Equity
Commitment Letter will be subject to the requirements that:

Stockholders of Record
If your Shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those Shares, the stockholder of record or record holder.
This proxy statement and proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company. As the stockholder of
record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote in person at the Special
Meeting. If you have requested printed proxy materials, we have enclosed a proxy card for you to use.
If you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, either in person or by proxy, your Shares will not
be voted at the Special Meeting, and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists.
Additionally, if you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, either in person or by proxy, your
failure to vote will have (a) the effect of counting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal with respect
to the approval threshold requiring the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of all
outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single class and (ii) a majority of the voting power of all
outstanding Shares, voting as a single class, that are not owned, beneficially or of record, by the Lopker
Entities, their respective affiliates, or any executive officer or director of the Company, and (b) no effect on
the Golden Parachute Proposal (so long as quorum is present) or the Adjournment Proposal (regardless of
whether a quorum is present).
Beneficial Owners
If your Shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of
those Shares held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your
broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those Shares, the stockholder of record. As
the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your
Shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting.
However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these Shares in person at the
Special Meeting unless you submit a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.
Your broker, bank or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your Shares if you instruct your broker,
bank or other nominee as to how to vote. You should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank
or other nominee regarding the voting of your Shares. Under applicable stock exchange rules, absent your
instructions, a broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on “non-routine”
matters and all of the matters to be considered at the Special Meeting are, under such rules, “non-routine.”
As a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such Shares, your broker, bank or other
nominee is not empowered to vote such Shares.
If you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on at least one, but not all of the proposals to
be considered at the Special Meeting, your Shares will be voted according to your instructions on those
proposals for which you have provided instructions and will be counted as present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. In this scenario, a “broker non-vote” will
occur with respect to each proposal for which you did not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank
or other nominee.
A failure to provide instructions with respect to any of the proposals and a broker non-vote will have (a) the
effect of a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal with respect to the approval threshold

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold Shares through the Effective Time who
do not vote such Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand
appraisal of such Shares and who do not effectively withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights of
appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of such Shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of
the DGCL (“Section 262”). The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to
appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex E and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its
entirety. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a
recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in Section
262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of Shares unless otherwise expressly
noted herein. Only a holder of record of Shares is entitled to demand appraisal of such Shares registered in
that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in Shares held of record in the name of another
person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the
steps set forth in Section 262 (and summarized below) properly and in a timely manner to

TABLE OF CONTENTS
perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your Shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to
exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with such broker, bank or other nominee.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of Shares who: (i) submit a written demand for
appraisal to the Company before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) do not
submit a proxy with respect to, or otherwise vote, the Shares for which such holders seek appraisal in favor
of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the
date of the making of the demand through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other
procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have such
Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of
such Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the
court. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss
appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number
of Shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding Shares
as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (b) the value of the aggregate per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected
exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal
award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
such period. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal
proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the
time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and
the “fair value” of the Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest
accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving
Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,
the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders
who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights
are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy
statement constitutes the Company’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection
with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E, in compliance
with the requirements of Section 262. In connection with the Merger, any holder of Shares who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex E
carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may
result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her, its or their appraisal
rights will be entitled to receive the per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement,
without interest thereon. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to
seek appraisal of any Shares, the Company believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights,
that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. To the extent there are any inconsistencies
between the summary of Section 262 contained herein and Section 262, Section 262 will govern.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their Shares must do ALL of the following:
NOT vote the Shares for which appraisal is sought in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement;
deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of such Shares before the vote on the Merger
Agreement at the Special Meeting, which written demand must reasonably inform the Company of the
identity of the stockholder who intends to demand appraisal of his, her, its or their Shares and that
such stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such Shares;
continuously hold such Shares on and from the date of making the demand through the Effective
Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the Shares before the
Effective Time); and
110 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of such
Shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. This may be undertaken by the stockholder (or any
person who is the beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust or by a broker, bank or other
nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation is under
no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of Shares wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to the Company, before the vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement will be submitted to stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s Shares,
and that stockholder must not vote such Shares or submit a proxy for such Shares in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement. A holder of Shares exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the Shares on the
date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the Shares of record through the
Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be
voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s
right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a
stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights for such stockholder’s Shares
must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or
abstain from voting, with respect to such Shares. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will,
in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The
written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote against the adoption
of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute
a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption
of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of Shares is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the Shares registered in that
holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of Shares must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of
record, and must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the holder and state that the person
intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s Shares in connection with the Merger. If the Shares are
owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such
demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the Shares are owned of record by more
than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint
owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify
the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as
agent for the record owner or owners. A record holder such as a broker, bank or other nominee who holds
Shares as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Shares held
for one or more beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand should set forth the number of Shares as
to which appraisal is sought, and where no number of Shares is expressly mentioned it will be presumed to
cover all Shares held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds Shares through a broker who in
turn holds the Shares through a central securities depositary nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for
appraisal of such Shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the
depository nominee as the record holder.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to the Company at
100 Innovation Place, Santa Barbara, CA 93108, and may not be submitted by electronic submission. Such
written demand must be delivered to and received by the Company before the vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
Any holder of Shares who has delivered a written demand to the Company and who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her, its or their demand
for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to the
Company a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the
demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving
Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect
the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, within sixty (60) days after
the Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and the Company, as the Surviving Corporation,
does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except
with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso
in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of
an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the
appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or
more than the per Share Merger Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify
each holder of Shares who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and
who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective
and the effective date thereof.
and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of
Shares who has complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262
(including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant Shares) may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving
Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination
of the fair value of the Shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving
Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should
not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair value of the Shares. Accordingly, any holders of Shares who desire to have their Shares appraised
should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their Shares within the time
and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Shares to file such a petition within the
period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Shares who has complied with the requirements of
Section 262 and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written
request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of Shares
not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which the Company has
received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such Shares. The Surviving
112 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten (10) days after receipt by the
Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration
of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of Shares held
either in a voting trust or by a broker, bank or other nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s
own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing
statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of Shares and a copy thereof is served upon the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such
service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses
of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their Shares and with whom agreements as to the value
of their Shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery
may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving
Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the written statement described above at the addresses
stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication
determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne by the Surviving Corporation. After notice to
stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing
on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who
demanded payment for their Shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any stockholder fails to comply with
the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have asserted
appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Shares entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership
thresholds described above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal
proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any
rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into
account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly
and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from
time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However,
at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the
Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at
such time.
In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods
which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving
the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,
the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on
future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion
113 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
[that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative
elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of
Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known
or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual
circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder’s exclusive remedy.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as so
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the
consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their Shares and
that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in
a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the per Share Merger Consideration. Neither
Company nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per Share Merger Consideration to any stockholder
exercising appraisal rights, and each of Company and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash
payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for
purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a Share is less than the per Share Merger Consideration. If a
petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been
satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of
the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court
of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with
an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses
of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the Shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of
such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her, its or their Shares under Section 262 fails to perfect, or
effectively loses or withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s Shares will be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw,
the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if
neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal
rights or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation an effective written withdrawal of the
holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote
such Shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except
dividends or other distributions on the holder’s Shares, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to
the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the ownership thresholds described
above has been satisfied as to the stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or if the stockholder delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger,
either within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving
Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is
filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to
any stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms
as the court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60)
days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a
stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights
is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

MERGER RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS  
(THE GOLDEN PARACHUTE PROPOSAL - PROPOSAL 2)
The Proposal
The Company is asking you to approve the Golden Parachute Proposal.
General
As required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company is
providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain
compensation arrangements for the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the “Potential Change-in-Control Payments to
Named Executive Officers” table and the footnotes to that table contained in the section captioned “Special
Factors - Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger - Golden Parachute
Compensation.”
The Company believes that those certain compensation arrangements for the Company’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger are reasonable and demonstrate that the Company’s executive
compensation program was designed appropriately and structured to ensure the retention of talented
executive officers and a strong alignment with the long-term interests of the Company’s stockholders. This
vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation that
may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. In addition,
this vote is separate and independent from the vote of stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement
Proposal. The Company asks that its stockholders vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that certain compensation arrangements for the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the “Potential Change-
in-Control Payments to Named Executive Officers” table and the footnotes to that table contained in the
section captioned “Special Factors - Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the
Merger - Golden Parachute Compensation,” is hereby APPROVED on a non-binding, advisory basis.”
This vote is advisory, and therefore, it will not be binding on the Company, nor will it overrule any prior
decision or require the QAD Board (or any committee thereof) to take any action. Furthermore, the CIC
Agreements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, the Company’s named executive officers may be or become
entitled to certain compensation arrangements in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in this proxy
statement. However, the QAD Board values the opinions of the Company’s stockholders, and to the extent
that there is any significant vote against the Golden Parachute Proposal, the QAD Board will consider
stockholders’ concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. The
QAD Board will consider the vote of a majority of the votes cast “FOR” the foregoing resolution as non-
binding, advisory approval of certain compensation arrangements for the Company’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.
Vote Required
The approval of the Golden Parachute Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the Shares
present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class. Each
record holder of Class A Common Stock is entitled to 1/20  of one vote for each share of Class A Common
Stock owned of record on the Record Date and each record holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled to
one (1) vote for each share of Class B Common Stock owned of record on the Record Date.

or appropriate, including adjournments to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time
of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal.
If the Company stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, the Company could adjourn the Special
Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal (other than in respect of any
proposal for which the vote has been taken and the polls have been closed at the Special Meeting). Among
other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if the Company had received
proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Agreement Proposal such that the

vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those Shares to change their
votes to votes in favor of any such proposal. Additionally, the Company may seek to adjourn the Special
Meeting if a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
We have historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on the Shares, however, except for those
dividends declared prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement prohibits us from
declaring or paying any dividends on the Shares until the Effective Time of the Merger or the termination of
the Merger Agreement, without Parent’s consent.
The closing price of the Shares on June 25, 2021, the last trading day before the Company publicly
announced the Merger, was $72.90 per share of Class A Common Stock and $48.00 per share of Class B
Common Stock.
On September 7, 2021, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was distributed to our
stockholders, the closing price for the Shares on the Nasdaq was $87.10 per share of Class A Common Stock
and $86.70 per share of Class B Common Stock. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for
the Shares in connection with voting your Shares.
If the Merger is completed, there will be no further market for the Shares and, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time and in compliance with applicable law, the Company’s securities will be delisted
from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act.",137,138
QAD INC_20210909_DEFM14A_19523541_4291901.Pdf,Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management,"Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of the Shares as of September 7, 2021 by:
each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the total outstanding Shares;
each of our named executive officers;
each of our directors; and
all of our executive officers and directors as a group.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of
Shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, Shares subject to
options, SARs, RSUs, PSUs, warrants and other rights held by that person that are currently exercisable or
become exercisable within sixty (60) days following September 7, 2021 are deemed outstanding. Such Shares,
however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other
person. Each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the
Shares shown as beneficially owned by such person, except as otherwise set forth in the notes to the table.
The percentages reflect beneficial ownership as of September 7, 2021 as determined in accordance with Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act. The address for all beneficial owners in the table below is 100 Innovation
Place, Santa Barbara, CA 93108, except as otherwise noted.

CONTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE AGREEMENT
THIS CONTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made as of June 27, 2021, by
and between Project Quick Ultimate Parent, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Parent”), on the one hand,
and Pamela M. Lopker (“Lopker”), The Lopker Living Trust dated November 18, 2013 (the “Lopker Trust”),
and the Estate of Karl F. Lopker (the “Lopker Estate” and collectively with Lopker and the Lopker Trust, the
“Rollover Investor”), on the other hand. Except as otherwise set forth herein, capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).
WHEREAS, Project Quick Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Project Quick Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and QAD Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”), are parties to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date
hereof (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company
with the Company being the surviving entity, and the Company will become a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent;
WHEREAS, in connection with (but subject to the consummation of) the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, Parent and Rollover Investor desire to enter into an agreement pursuant to which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (a) Rollover Investor shall contribute to Parent the Rollover Shares
(as defined below), (b) in exchange for such Rollover Shares, Parent shall issue to Rollover Investor, on the
terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, the Parent Units (as defined below), and (c) Parent
shall contribute the Rollover Shares to a newly-formed, direct subsidiary of Parent (“Intermediate”); and
WHEREAS, it is intended that the contribution of Rollover Shares in exchange for Parent Units be treated for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a tax-free contribution governed by Section 721 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth herein, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Contribution and Issuance of Parent Units.
(a) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Rollover Closing”), Rollover Investor hereby
contributes, transfers and assigns (or causes to be contributed, transferred and assigned) to Parent, free
and clear of all Liens, all of Rollover Investor’s right, title and interests in the shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock (the “Rollover Shares”) set forth on Exhibit A with the aggregate
value as of the Closing set forth across from the heading “Aggregate Value of Rollover Shares” on
Exhibit A. Parent acknowledges and agrees that Rollover Investor may, upon written notice to Parent,
amend Exhibit A hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time without the consent of Parent to change
the mix of shares or particular shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock included in
the Rollover Shares, provided, that the “Aggregate Value of Rollover Shares” set forth therein shall not
change from the amount set forth on Exhibit A.
(b) In exchange for such Rollover Shares, Parent hereby issues to Rollover Investor (or its designated
Affiliate) (i) the number of Parent’s Class A Units (“Class A Units”) set forth on Exhibit A at the per Unit
agreed upon value set forth therein and (ii) the number of Parent’s Class B Units (“Class B Units”) set
forth on Exhibit A  at the per Unit agreed upon value set forth therein (collectively, such Class A Units
and Class B Units, the “Parent Units”), such that immediately thereafter, Parent Units having an
aggregate value equal to the value attributed to the Rollover Shares shall have been issued to Rollover
Investor (or its designated Affiliate).
C-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS
(c) The issuance of the Parent Units to Rollover Investor hereunder is intended to be exempt from
registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act. Immediately after the issuance of the Parent Units to Rollover Investor, the parties agree
that each Class A Unit will be treated under the LP Agreement as having made a capital contribution of
$1,000 for each such Class A Unit.
(d) Prior to the Closing Date, Rollover Investor may permit either or both of Bo Lopker and Juliana
Lopker (each, an “Alternative Rollover Investor”) to enter into a separate Contribution and Exchange
Agreement (each, an “Alternative Rollover Agreement”) with Parent, on substantially the same terms as
those set forth in this Agreement (other than the covenants contained in Section 8, which shall not be
required), pursuant to which each Alternative Rollover Investor will agree to contribute Company
Common Stock, with an aggregate value not to exceed $15,000,000, to Parent in exchange for Parent
Units. Upon execution of any Alternative Rollover Agreement, the parties will cause Exhibit A hereto to
be amended to reflect a reduction in the aggregate numbers of Rollover Shares, and Parent Units
hereunder by the aggregate amount of the commitments under all Alternative Rollover Agreements.
(e) Prior to the Closing Date, each of Parent and Rollover Investor shall negotiate in good faith the
terms of the LP Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, with such terms to be consistent
with the terms set forth on the Equity Term Sheet attached hereto as Exhibit B.
(f) As a condition to the issuance of the Parent Units, Rollover Investor shall deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to Parent (i) a certificate representing the Rollover Shares (if certificated) free and clear from
all Liens duly endorsed (or accompanied by a duly executed share power with respect to the Rollover
Shares), and (ii) a duly executed counterpart signature page to each of the LP Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement.
(g) The Parent Units will continue to be Parent Units for purposes of this Agreement in the hands of any
holder other than Rollover Investor (except for Parent or its Subsidiaries and except for transferees in a
Public Offering), and except as otherwise provided herein or in the LP Agreement, each such other
holder of the Parent Units will succeed to all rights and obligations attributable to Rollover Investor as a
holder of the Parent Units pursuant to this Agreement and the LP Agreement. The Parent Units will also

or covenants regarding such tax consequences or benefits upon which Rollover Investor has relied.
3. Representations and Warranties of Parent. In connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent represents and warrants to Rollover Investor, as of the date hereof and as of the Rollover Closing,
that:
(a) Parent is a limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws

judgment or decree to which Parent is a party or by which it is bound.
(c) The Parent Units, when issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, will be duly authorized,
validly issued and outstanding, fully paid, no assessable and free and clear of all Liens, other than as
applicable to the Parent Units or the holders thereof under applicable federal and state securities laws,
the LP Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.
(d) The Rollover Investor will acquire Parent Units pursuant to this Agreement for the same price per
Parent Unit as TB is acquiring its equity interests in Parent in connection with the Merger (valuing the
Rollover Shares based on the Merger Consideration).
(e) Parent was formed solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and, except for obligations incurred or actions taken in connection with its formation or the
negotiation and consummation of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, Parent has not engaged in any business or activity of any type or

arising hereunder) shall be governed by the internal law of the State of Delaware without giving effect

Delaware. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LITIGATION, ACTION, PROCEEDING, CROSS-CLAIM, OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY COURT
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN

PROCEEDING SEEKING EQUITABLE RELIEF) SHALL PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN THE
COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (THE “COURT OF CHANCERY”) OR, TO THE
EXTENT THE COURT OF CHANCERY DOES NOT HAVE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE AND THE APPELLATE
COURTS HAVING JURISDICTION OF APPEALS IN SUCH COURTS (THE “DELAWARE FEDERAL
COURT”) OR, TO THE EXTENT NEITHER THE COURT OF CHANCERY NOR THE DELAWARE
FEDERAL COURT HAS SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE

Agreement specifically, to recover damages and costs (including attorney’s fees) caused by any breach
of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights existing in its favor. The parties
hereto agree and acknowledge that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of
the provisions of this Agreement and that any party may in its sole discretion apply to any court of law
or equity of competent jurisdiction (without posting any bond or deposit) for specific performance
and/or other injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this
Agreement.
(k) Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any
manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each party. No failure or delay of either party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. A waiver of
right or remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right or
remedy on any other occasion. Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and remedies of the
parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies, which they would
otherwise have hereunder. Any agreement on the part of either party to any such waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of
such party.

this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,

Rollover Investor in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and Rollover Investor’s

EXHIBIT B​
TERM SHEET FOR CO-INVESTOR EQUITY
The following details certain terms for (i) a limited partnership agreement (the “LP Agreement”) to be entered
into among Project Quick Ultimate Parent, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), Thoma
Bravo Fund XIV, L.P., and certain affiliated investment funds (collectively, “TB”), the Rollover Investor set
forth in the Contribution and Exchange Agreement to which this term sheet is attached (“Co-Investor”) and
certain other equityholders and (ii) a registration rights agreement to be entered into among the Partnership,
TB, Co-Investor and certain other equityholders, in each case in connection with the acquisition (the
“Transaction”) by a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership of all of the issued and
outstanding stock of QAD Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Target”).
Board of Managers
The Partnership shall be managed by a Board of Managers (the “Board”),
which managers, subject to the immediately following sentence, shall all be
appointed, removed and replaced solely by TB. Co-Investor shall be entitled
to one seat on the Board (and any committee to which the Board might
delegate broad duties such that such committee effectively acts like the
Board, but excluding (for the avoidance of doubt) the audit and cyber
security committees with customary duties) for so long as Co-Investor
(including her Permitted Transferees) holds at least 40% of the equity
acquired by Co-Invest pursuant to the Contribution and Exchange
Agreement. An action of the Board will require the approval of a majority of
the managers obtained at a meeting called with at least 24 hours notice or by
written consent of the Board that is either unanimous or sent to Co-Investor
no fewer than 48 hours prior to such action being effective.
Terms of Securities
TB and Co-Investor shall acquire equity interests of the Partnership in
“strips” of Class A Units and Class B Units. For each dollar invested, Co-
Investor shall receive the same strip of Class A Units and Class B Units
received by TB in exchange for each dollar invested by TB. All of the
invested dollars at Closing (including Co-Investor’s rollover contribution)
will be allocated to the Class A Units for purposes of determining capital
contributions.
The Class A Units will, in priority and preference to the Class B Units, entitle
the holders thereof to an amount equal to the capital contributions with
respect to the Class A Units plus any accrued and unpaid yield at a rate of
9% per annum, compounded quarterly (the “Liquidation Value”). After
payment in full of the Liquidation Value, proceeds shall be allocated pro-rata
amongst the holders of Class B Units in accordance with the LP Agreement.
Preemptive Rights
Co-Investor shall have customary preemptive rights (based on relative pro
rata ownership) in the event that the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries
authorizes the issuance or sale of any new equity securities (including
securities convertible into equity securities) of the Partnership or any of its
subsidiaries to TB or its affiliates, subject to customary exceptions.
Transfer Restrictions
Prior to a Sale of the Partnership (as defined below), Co-Investor shall not
transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of any interest without the prior
written consent of TB (which may be given or withheld in its sole discretion),
except transfers (i) to Permitted Transferees, (ii) as a participating unitholder
in a sale by TB, (iii) pursuant to a conversion of the Partnership or (iv) in an
Approved Sale (as defined below).
In the case of Co-Investor, a transfer to a “Permitted Transferee” shall
include transfers to (i) a trust solely for the benefit of Co-Investor and/or her
spouse and/or descendants and any family partnership or similar estate
1 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
planning vehicle, the partners, members or equityholders of which consist
solely of Co-Investor, her spouse and/or descendants and (ii) family
foundations for the benefit of Co-Investor and her spouse and/or
descendants and (iii) to any other family member.
For the avoidance of doubt, Co-Investor shall not have the right to appoint
or transfer Co-Investor’s Board seat.
Participation Rights
Prior to a Sale of the Partnership, if TB intends to transfer a portion of its
interests (subject to customary exceptions, such as transfers to Permitted
Transferees, which will include affiliated investment funds), Co-Investor will
have customary “tag along” rights and be entitled to sell in the contemplated
transfer the same class(es) of units at the same price as TB on a pro rata
basis. Unitholders participating in such transfer shall be required to agree to
the same terms as TB is required to agree to in connection with such transfer
and shall (i) be required to pay their pro rata share (based on the amount of
consideration received by such holder of Partnership units in such transfer
for such holder’s units) of the aggregate expenses incurred by TB and the
participating unitholders in connection with such transfer and (ii) join on a
several, and not joint and several, basis (based on the amount of
consideration received by such holder of Partnership Units in such transfer
for such holder’s units) in any indemnification or other obligations that TB
agrees to provide in connection with such transfer, up to the net proceeds
actually received by such participating unitholder (other than such
indemnification or other obligations that relate specifically to the equity
interests of any such unitholder being transferred in the transaction), subject
to customary conditions and limitations (including that (a) no participating
holder shall be required to make representations or warranties that are
different in any material respect from those made by all other participating
holders, and (b) no participating holder shall be liable for the inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty made by any other participating holder in
connection with such transaction, other than the Partnership).
Sale of the Partnership
If TB approves a Sale of the Partnership (an “Approved Sale”), each holder
of Partnership units shall vote for, consent to and raise no objections against
such Approved Sale. If the Approved Sale is structured as a (i) merger,
equity exchange or consolidation, each holder of Partnership units shall
waive any dissenters’ rights, appraisal rights or similar rights in connection
with such merger, equity exchange or consolidation, (ii) sale of Partnership
units or equity exchange, each holder of Partnership units shall agree to sell
or exchange, as applicable, all of his, her or its Partnership units or rights to
acquire Partnership units on the same terms and conditions applicable to TB
or (iii) sale of the Partnership’s assets (including its wholly-owned
subsidiaries), each holder of Partnership units shall, to the extent a vote is
required, vote his, her or its Partnership units to approve such sale and any
subsequent liquidation of the Partnership or other pro rata distribution of
the proceeds therefrom to the Partnership unitholders on a pari passu basis
with TB in accordance with the distribution waterfall, whether by written
consent or at a unitholders’ meeting.
Each holder of Partnership units shall take all necessary or desirable actions
in connection with the consummation of the Approved Sale as reasonably
requested by the Board or TB. In connection with an Approved Sale, the
holders of Partnership units shall agree to appoint Thoma Bravo, L.P. or its
designee as the representative for all holders of Partnership units and Thoma
Bravo, L.P. or its designee shall have customary rights and privileges
2 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
as the representative and agent for the selling unitholders in such an
Approved Sale, provided that Thoma Bravo, L.P. shall not be permitted to (I)
serve as proxy, attorney-in-fact or otherwise execute any agreement on
behalf of Co-Investor, (II) commence or defend litigation where Co-Investor
is named as plaintiff or defendant without Co-Investor’s consent (it being
understood that the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the Thoma Bravo,
L.P.’s ability to commence or defend litigation on behalf of all partners
collectively or to commence or defend litigation on behalf of the Partnership
and its Subsidiaries) or agree to any term or condition as part of any
settlement that would involve any obligation of Co-Investor other than the
payment of monetary damages payable on a several and not joint and several
basis by all similarly situated holders or (III) take any action on behalf of Co-
Investor that is otherwise not permitted to be taken by TB under the LP
Agreement.
Holders of Partnership units will (i) bear their pro rata (based upon the
amount of consideration received by such holder of Partnership units in the
Approved Sale for such holder’s units) portion of the costs of any Approved
Sale to the extent such costs are incurred for the benefit of all holders of
Partnership units and are not otherwise paid by the Partnership or the
acquiring party and (ii) be obligated to join on a several, and not joint and
several, basis (based upon the amount of consideration received by such
holder of Partnership units in the Approved Sale for such holder’s units) in
any indemnification or other obligations TB agrees to provide in connection
with such Approved Sale, up to the net proceeds actually received by such
unitholder (other than such indemnification or other obligations that relate
specifically to any such unitholder), subject to customary conditions and
limitations (including that (a) no holder shall be required to make
representations or warranties that are different in any material respect from
those made by all other holders, and (b) no holder shall be liable for the
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by any other holder in
connection with such transaction, other than the Partnership).
“Sale of the Partnership” means any transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which any person(s) or entity(ies) in the aggregate
acquire(s) (i) units of the Partnership possessing the power (other than
voting rights accruing only in the event of a default, breach or event of
noncompliance) to elect a majority of the Board (whether by merger,
consolidation, reorganization, combination, sale or transfer of the
Partnership’s units, unitholder or voting agreement, proxy, power of attorney
or otherwise) or (ii) all or substantially all of the Partnership’s assets
determined on a consolidated basis.
In the event that TB proposes to transfer any of its units to the Partnership,
then TB shall have the right to compel the other holders to transfer their pro
rata portion of the aggregate interests of the class or series of units so
proposed to be transferred by TB, subject to the procedures and protections
described above, as applicable.
Conversion to a Corporation; 
Subsidiary IPO
In the event TB desires to convert the Partnership into a corporation in
connection with an IPO or for any other reason, the unitholders shall agree
to take all actions requested by TB or the Partnership in connection with
such conversion, including, without limitation, voting for or consenting to
such conversion and entering into a stockholders agreement and/or other
agreements reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to reflect
substantially the same terms set forth in the LP Agreement, and the same
economic terms in respect of the economic interests held by TB and
3 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Co-Investor; provided that Co-Investor’s consent shall be required for any
conversion effected other than to facilitate an IPO if such conversion would
reasonably be expected to be a taxable event to Co-Investor for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and would have a disproportionate adverse economic
effect on Co-Investor compared to TB (and for this purpose all TB and the
Co-Investor shall be treated as having identical tax characteristics and
attributes, including (1) being subject to identical tax rates and (2) being
subject to tax in all of the same jurisdictions, and any matters involving Code
Sections 704(c) and 737 and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder
shall not be taken into account). Similarly, in the event TB desires to effect a
subsidiary IPO, the unitholders shall agree to take all actions reasonably
requested by TB or the Partnership in connection with such IPO, including,
without limitation, voting for or consenting to any such actions necessary or
desirable in connection therewith and entering into a stockholders agreement
and/or other agreements necessary or appropriate in order to reflect
substantially the same terms set forth in the LP Agreement.
Registration Rights
TB will have demand and piggy-back registration rights at the Partnership’s
expense. Co-Investor will be entitled to participate (i.e., piggy back) on a pro
rata basis (based on units held) with TB in any registered public offering of
Partnership stock (following a reorganization). The Registration Rights
Agreement will include customary holdback or lock-up covenants applicable
equally to TB and Co-Investor with respect to the IPO and subsequent
registered offerings. In addition, at TB’s request, TB and Co-Investor shall
enter into a customary two-year coordination agreement in connection with
an IPO, provided that each of TB and Co-Investor have the same pro rata
access to liquidity. Co-Investor shall have the right to require the Partnership
to file and keep effective a shelf-registration statement covering resales by
Co-Investor following the second anniversary of the IPO.
Consent Rights
Co-Investor will have a consent right with respect to the following:
(i) non-arms’ length transactions between the Partnership or any of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and TB or any of its affiliates, on the other
hand, subject to customary exceptions for (a) commercial transactions with
TB portfolio companies in the ordinary course of business on terms no less
favorable in any material respect to the Partnership than would be generally
available to other similarly situated companies not affiliated with TB, (b)
expense reimbursement, D&O insurance and indemnification agreements, (c)
customary compensation arrangements (whether in the form of cash and/or
equity) with TB operating partners, (d) an advisory services agreement that
provides for an annual monitoring fee equal to 1% of TB’s equity investment,
expense reimbursement (including reimbursement of TB’s transaction
expenses related to the Transaction) and customary indemnification, (f) an
investment purchase agreement pursuant to which TB will acquire equity
interests of the Partnership at the closing of the Transaction, and (g) TB’s
credit fund participating (in a non-lead role and on terms no more favorable
than other participants) in the credit facility or other debt of the Partnership
or its Subsidiaries, including the receipt of payments and exercise of rights
by TB’s credit fund in accordance with the terms of such credit facility or
debt; and
(ii) any non-pro rata distributions to equityholders of the Partnership.
Information Rights
For so long as Co-Investor holds any outstanding Class B Units, Co-
Investor shall receive from the Partnership unaudited quarterly financial
statements, audited annual financial statements, an annual budget and such
other information reasonably required for tax compliance purposes.

Dilution
Subject to the preemptive rights described above, each of TB and the other
unitholders shall be diluted, without dilution protection, by any equity
issued or sold to management, board members, operating partners,
consultants or employees of the Partnership or its affiliates.
Amendments
Any amendment or change to the LP Agreement or Registration Rights
Agreement that has a disproportionate and adverse effect on Co-Investor as
compared to the other unit holders holding the same class of units shall
require the prior written consent of Co-Investor.
Governing Law
This summary of terms, and the agreements to be entered into as described
herein, shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.
Tax Matters
The LP Agreement shall include a customary tax distribution provision.
The Partnership shall use the “traditional method” for purposes of making
any allocations required under Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
For so long as Co-Investor is a unitholder of the Partnership, (X) at the
written request of the Co-Investor, the Partnership shall provide Co-Investor
with a copy of all income tax returns of the Partnership that have been filed
for periods in which the Co-Investor was a unitholder provided that the
Partnership in its discretion may redact any information with respect to other
partners, and (Y) the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
connection with any taxable sale of a portion but not all of a specific class of
property (including any class of stock of any corporate subsidiary of the
Partnership) held by the Partnership to not disproportionately transfer
property within such specific class of property that is 704(c) Property. For
this purpose, “704(c) Property” means (i) property (other than cash) that was
contributed by the Co-Investor or (ii) property issued to the Partnership with
respect to property (other than cash) contributed by the Co-Investor to the
Partnership that was “section 704(c) property”  (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3) with respect to the Co-Investor. In the
event that the Partnership makes any distribution of any property
contributed to the Partnership by Co-Investor within seven years of such
contribution and Co-Investor is otherwise entitled to participate in such
distribution, the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
distribute such property to Co-Investor.

Special Committee of the Board of 
Directors QAD Inc.

Santa Barbara, CA 93108
Members of the Special Committee of the Board:
We understand that QAD Inc. (the “Company”), Project Quick Parent, LLC (“Parent”) and Project Quick
Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated as of June 27, 2021 (the “Merger
Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with and
into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent,
and each outstanding share of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (“Class A
Common Stock”), and Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (“Class B Common
Stock”, and, together with Class A Common Stock, the “Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares of Company Common Stock that are, as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (i) issued and held by the Company or any of the
Company’s direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, (ii) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, (iii) held by a member of the Company management
identified in the Merger Agreement as Rollover Shares, or (iv) held by holders of such shares who have not
voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have
properly exercised and validly perfected appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who
have complied with, Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware with respect to any
such shares held by any such holder (clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), collectively, the “Excluded Shares”), will
be converted automatically into the right to receive $87.50 per share in cash, without interest and subject to
any withholding Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the “Merger
Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement,
and capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined will have the meanings set forth in the Merger
Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the
Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company Common
Stock in the aggregate.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial
information of the Company;
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data
concerning the Company;
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company and
certain extrapolations prepared with guidance from the management of the Company (which
were reviewed and approved for our use by the management of the Company) (collectively, the
“Financial Projections”);4)

Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the
Company with senior executives of the Company;
Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Class A Common Stock;
Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the
Company Common Stock with that of certain other publicly traded companies comparable with
the Company, and their securities;
Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition
transactions;
Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company,
Parent and their respective financial and legal advisors;
Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft equity commitment letter from the equity financing
source to the Parent, substantially in the form of the draft dated June 26, 2021 (the “Equity
Commitment Letter”) and certain related documents; and
Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other
factors as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company and
formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the Financial Projections, we have assumed that
they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. We
express no view as to such Financial Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition,
we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among other
things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter, and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof
furnished to us. In addition, we understand from the Company that, pursuant to Article IV of the Company’s
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Class A Common Stock must receive an amount and form of
consideration per share that is no less favorable than the consideration per share received by the holders of
the Class B Common Stock in the event of a merger, business combination or consolidation of the Company,
including the Merger. We express no view as to the allocation of Merger Consideration between the Class A
Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock, or the relative fairness of any portion of the Merger
Consideration to holders of any series of common stock of the Company. We have assumed that, in
connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that
would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed
Merger. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon,
without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors
with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the
Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not
such alternatives could be achieved or are available. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of
the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any
class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the Merger. We have not made
any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof.
Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and
we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of which is
D-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS
contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided
financial advisory and financing services to Thoma Bravo, LLC (“Thoma Bravo”) (the ultimate controlling
equity owner of the Parent) and certain of its affiliates and their affiliated funds’ respective portfolio
companies (collectively the “Thoma Bravo Related Entities”), and, in each case, have received fees in
connection with such services. Neither we nor any of our affiliates have been engaged on any financial
advisory or financing assignments for the Company, and have received any fees for such services from the
Company during the two years prior to the date hereof. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial
advisory and/or financing services to the Company, Parent, Thoma Bravo and the Thoma Bravo Related
Entities in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services. In addition, we,
our affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with the Special Committee of the Board of
Directors, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by
Thoma Bravo.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment
management and individual wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities
underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime
brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan
Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that
invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect
transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of
Thoma Bravo, the Thoma Bravo Related Entities, Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates, or any
other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative
instrument.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other
professionals in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Special
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed
without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any
filing the Company is required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this
transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion
or recommendation as to how the stockholders of the Company should vote at the stockholders’ meeting to
be held in connection with the Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the
holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to
such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the aggregate.

Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a
demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds
such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with
subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor

Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record
date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to
act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to §251(h),
as of immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a
national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided
that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation
surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the
surviving corporation as provided in §251(f) of this title.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders
thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§251,
252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;
Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which
shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the

exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

[Repealed.]
Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section
shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its(d) 
(1)

TABLE OF CONTENTS
certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent
corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is
to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days
prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with §255(c) of this
title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c)
of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent
corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to
demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the
taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic
transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that
purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of
the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute
such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written
demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation
who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or
If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to §228, §251(h), §253, or §267 of this title,
then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the
surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the
approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares
of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of
§114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of
giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, within the
later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days after the
date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the
appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by
electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly
designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs
the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send
a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal
rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following
the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title,
later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20
days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been
given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For
purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent
corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date
the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the
notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof
and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements
of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic
transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that
purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger
or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted
in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this
title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in §251(h)(6)d. of this
title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in,
the offer referred to in §251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have
been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the
stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding
subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either
in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.
Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the
Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements
as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the
petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by
such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the
time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such
notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by
the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.
At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this
section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who
have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit
their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss
the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of
the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were
listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of
such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
E-3 
(h) 
(i) 
(j) 
(k) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2)
the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares
exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to §253 or §267 of this title.
After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of
the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the
fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless
the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this
subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment
shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the
merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in
cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving
or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the
Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate
fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal
rights under this section.
The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to
each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders
of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery
may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of
any state.
The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be
charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the
merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the
time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or
resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the
corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder
without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court
deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has
not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of
this section.

Company SAR (the “Cash Replacement SAR Amounts”). The Cash Replacement SAR Amount for
such cancelled Unvested Company SAR will be payable in accordance with the vesting terms of
such Unvested Company SARs.
(iii) Vested Company RSUs and Vested Company PSUs. Each Vested Company RSU and Vested
Company PSU shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock

Company PSUs granted in 2019 and at 100% of target performance for Company PSUs granted in
2021), as applicable, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration (the “Vested RSU/PSU
Consideration”), subject to any required withholding of Taxes, payable on the Closing Payment
Schedule.
(iv) Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs. Except as otherwise provided for on
Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to the Unvested Company RSUs and
Unvested Company PSUs:
(1) Each award of Company RSUs and Company PSUs that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU (other
than Company PSUs granted in 2019, which shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the
Effective Date if performance has not been achieved as of the Effective Date and if
performance has been achieved as of the Effective Date, then such Company PSUs shall be
earned at actual performance) (the “Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs”)
shall be cancelled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (A) the amount of the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested
Company PSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cash Replacement Company
RSU/PSU Amounts” and with the Cash Replacement SAR Amounts, the “Cash Replacement
Amounts”).
(2) For each tranche of cancelled Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company PSUs, fifty
percent (50%) of the Cash Replacement Company RSU/PSU Amounts, subject to any required
withholding of Taxes, will be payable on the Closing Payment Schedule, with performance
achievement determined based on clause (4) below.
(3) For each tranche of cancelled Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs, the
remaining 50% of the Cash Replacement Company RSU/PSU Amounts for each tranche of
Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs will, subject to the holder’s
continued service with the Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU and Unvested
PSUs for which such Cash Replacement RSU/PSU Amounts were exchanged would have
vested pursuant to their terms or upon an earlier qualifying termination of employment without
cause or constructive termination as described in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, with performance achievement determined based on clause (4) below.
(4) Except as otherwise provided herein, all Cash Replacement Company RSU/PSU Amounts
will have the same terms and conditions (including, with respect to vesting (including
accelerated vesting on specific terminations of employment, to the extent applicable)) as
applied to the Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs for which they were
exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Transactions or for such
other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination
of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement Company
RSU/PSU Amounts; provided that with respect to Cash Replacement PSU Amounts that relate
to the tranche of Unvested Company PSUs that were granted in 2021 for which the
performance period has not yet been achieved, such achievement will be deemed at 100% of
target. All such Cash Replacement Company RSU/PSU Amounts will be subject to accelerated
A-19 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
vesting upon a qualifying termination of employment without cause or constructive
termination as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.
(5) For purposes of clarity, the number of shares of Company Stock underlying the Vested
Company PSUs, for which the performance period has not been achieved as of the Effective
Time, will be determined based on actual performance, based on the results through the
Effective Time as determined in good faith by the Company’s Compensation Committee (in
consultation with Parent), taking into account truncation of goals based on the remaining time
in the performance period and seasonality of performance, and the number of shares
underlying the Vested Company PSUs, for which the performance period has been achieved,
will be based on such achievement; provided that with respect to Vested Company PSUs that
were granted in 2021 for which the performance period has not yet been achieved, such
achievement will be deemed at 100% of target.
(v) Payment Procedures. The Surviving Corporation shall pay on the timing dates set forth above
all Cash Replacement Amounts, as applicable, net of any applicable withholding Taxes, through, to
the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation’s payroll (subject to any required tax
withholdings) to the applicable holders of such Company Equity Awards. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company SARs, Company RSUs and Company PSUs
pursuant to this Section 3.2(a), cannot be made through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system
or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such
holder promptly following the Effective Time.
(b) With respect to any amount payable under Section 3.2(a) that constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that payment of such amount would
otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall
instead be made at the earliest time permitted under this Agreement and the terms of the corresponding
award that will not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock, other capital stock of the Company, or
other compensation of any kind (other than amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2(a) to
any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any Company equity or equity-based awards under the
Company Stock Plans otherwise and the Company Stock Plans will thereupon terminate.

holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to receive
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant
to clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c). On the Closing Date and substantially concurrently
with the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock
described in Section 3.1(a)(iii) and the Rollover Shares, and assuming there are no Dissenting Shares),
an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable at or in connection
with the Closing (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued
in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 3.3(a), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration. Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund.
(b) Payment Procedures.
(i) Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any event not more than three (3) Business Days
thereafter, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
A-20 TABLE OF CONTENTS
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares, the Rollover Shares, and shares of Company Common Stock
described in Section 3.1(a)(iii)) (the “Certificates”); and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares, the Rollover Shares, and shares of Company Common Stock described in
Section 3.1(a)(iii)) (the “Uncertificated Shares”), (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(ii) and any dividends or other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to clause (ii)
of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive, and the
Paying Agent shall promptly pay, in exchange therefor, an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificate, and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of
an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent
shall promptly pay, in exchange therefor, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares, and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered will be cancelled. The Paying Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying
Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii)
and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares as contemplated by clause (ii) of the first
sentence of Section 3.3(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder
of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal
to the Paying Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 3.1(a)(ii).
(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with
the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company with the objective that the Paying Agent will
transmit to the Depository Trust Company or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
(excluding any shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(a)(iii), the Rollover
Shares and Dissenting Shares, and including any dividends or other distributions pertaining to
such shares as contemplated by clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c)) held of record by
the Depository Trust Company or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Termination Rights. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock, subject, however, to (i) Section
3.4 and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared by the Company on Company
Common Stock prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation to be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration
A-21 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares (other
than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in
Section 3.1(b)), and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to such shares as contemplated by
clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c), without any interest thereon.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
former stockholders of the Company on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions pertaining to their former shares of Company Common Stock that such former holders have
the right to receive pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c), without interest
thereon, shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (as general unsecured
creditors) for payment of their claim, in respect of such shares.
(e) No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is
immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing shares of
Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(a)(iii)) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as

consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel) that (i) such Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to make the Company Change in

to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, (A) subject to
compliance with Section 6.4(f), the Company Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee,
may make a Company Change in Recommendation or (B) the Company may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(h) in order to enter into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement with

Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent four (4)

any Company Subsidiary and together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators

including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification
Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security ; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the payment of any
Indemnification Expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of a
Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay all amounts so paid in advance if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 6.11 extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Proceeding relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the

representatives. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this Section 6.11(a), upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation
in writing (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have
under this Section 6.11(a), except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party’s position

defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,
defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Proceeding for which indemnification is required to be
provided pursuant to this Section 6.11(a), including any Proceeding relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any Judgment in any actual or threatened
Proceeding in respect of which indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder
unless such settlement, compromise or Judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or

in the conduct of the defense of such action. For the avoidance of doubt, any Proceeding related to
Dissenting Shares will be governed by Section 3.4. The provisions of this Section 6.14 that concern the

reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, in the case of the payment of the
Company Termination Fee, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the case of payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this

Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only the Company shall be liable
for damages for such fraud or Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, the Company Related
Parties shall not have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or
the Transactions, (ii) the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated or (iii) any
breach (or threatened or alleged breach) of, or failure (or threatened or alleged failure) to perform under,

obligations of Parent under Section 8.4(f), Section 6.16(c) and Section 6.17, in the event the Parent
Termination Fee is paid to the Company in circumstances for which such fee is payable pursuant to
Section 8.4(e), payment of the Parent Termination Fee, together with any amount payable pursuant to
Section 8.4(f), shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (other than as provided in the Guarantee) of the

Transactions, (ii) the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated or (iii) any

would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by
the parties. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or
any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in

adequate remedy for any such breach. Each Party further agrees that neither the Other Party nor any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.9, and each party irrevocably

instrument.
