The Merger Proposal (see page 17)
Monmouth is asking its common shareholders to vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Monmouth with and
into Merger Sub (the “Merger”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 5, 2021 (as it
may be amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Monmouth, ILPT, and Merger Sub (the “Merger
Proposal”).
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of
Monmouth Common Stock outstanding as of the record date for the special meeting of Monmouth’s common
shareholders (the “Special Meeting”). For approval of the Merger Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or
“ABSTAIN.” If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, but do not indicate
instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on the Merger Proposal, your shares of
Monmouth Common Stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of Monmouth’s board of directors,
which is “FOR” the Merger Proposal. Because the required vote for the Merger Proposal is based on the number of
votes Monmouth common shareholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote
your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will
have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
If Monmouth common shareholders fail to approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur.
Monmouth’s board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the approval of the Merger Proposal.
The Compensation Proposal (see page 18)
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Monmouth is asking its common shareholders to
vote at the Special Meeting on an advisory basis regarding the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger (the “Compensation Proposal”).
The common shareholder vote on executive compensation is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on
Monmouth, its board of directors or ILPT. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by
their terms, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the
Merger is completed, Monmouth’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be
paid or become payable to Monmouth’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger,
in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation. Approval of the Compensation
Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires, provided a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast on the proposal. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet,
but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on the Compensation
Proposal, your shares of Monmouth Common Stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of
Monmouth’s board of directors, which is “FOR” the Compensation Proposal. An abstention (which will count as
present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum) or failure to vote on the Compensation Proposal
(including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) will have no effect on the
approval of the Compensation Proposal, assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting.
Monmouth’s board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Monmouth’s named executive officers that
is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger.
The Adjournment Proposal (see page 19)
Monmouth is asking its common shareholders to vote on a proposal to approve any adjournments of the Special
Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Merger Proposal (the
“Adjournment Proposal”).
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires, provided a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast on the proposal. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet,
but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on the Adjournment
Proposal, your shares of Monmouth Common Stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of
Monmouth’s board of directors, which is “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. An abstention (which will count as
present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum) or failure to vote on the Adjournment Proposal (including
failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) will have no effect on the approval of the
Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting.

General Description of the Merger (see page 25)
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, ILPT will acquire Monmouth and its subsidiaries through the merger of
Monmouth with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ILPT. At the
effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Monmouth Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Monmouth, ILPT
or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive $21.00 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”), without
interest, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of
Monmouth’s 6.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Monmouth Preferred Stock”) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Monmouth, ILPT or Merger Sub)
will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $25.00 plus accumulated and unpaid dividends
to, but not including, the date the Merger is completed (the “Preferred Stock Consideration”).
Recommendation of Monmouth’s Board of Directors and Its Reasons for the Merger (see page 32)
Monmouth’s board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” each of the proposals to be considered and voted
upon at the Special Meeting. In evaluating the Merger, Monmouth’s board of directors consulted with Monmouth’s
management and its legal and financial advisors and, after careful consideration, Monmouth’s board of directors
unanimously determined and declared that the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Monmouth and its shareholders,
approved, adopted, and authorized in all respects the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and authorized the execution and delivery by Monmouth of the Merger
Agreement. See “The Merger-Recommendation of Monmouth’s Board of Directors and Its Reasons for the Merger”
for more information about the factors considered by Monmouth’s board of directors in determining and declaring
that the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are

adopting, and authorizing the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, in authorizing the execution and delivery by Monmouth of the Merger Agreement, and in
recommending that Monmouth shareholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
Opinions of Monmouth’s Financial Advisors (see page 35)
Opinion of J.P. Morgan
In connection with the Merger, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”), Monmouth’s financial advisor, delivered
to Monmouth’s board of directors an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
November 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its
opinion, the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such shareholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated November 4, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan
in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The
summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of such opinion. Monmouth’s common shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P.
Morgan’s opinion was addressed to Monmouth’s board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and
for the purposes of its evaluation of the Merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s
common shareholders in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no
opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Monmouth or as to the underlying decision by Monmouth to
engage in the Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan.
The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Monmouth as to how such shareholder
should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. For a description of the opinion that Monmouth received
from J.P. Morgan, see the section entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Monmouth’s Financial Advisors-Opinion of J.P.
Morgan.”
Opinion of CSCA
CSCA Capital Advisors, LLC (“CSCA”) was engaged by Monmouth to serve as a financial advisor in connection
with the Merger. On November 4, 2021, CSCA rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing
by delivery of CSCA’s written opinion dated November 4, 2021) to Monmouth’s board of directors that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of Monmouth Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Monmouth’s common shareholders.
The full text of CSCA’s written opinion, dated as of November 4, 2021, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
CSCA’s written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors
considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by CSCA in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read
CSCA’s opinion carefully in its entirety. For a summary of CSCA’s opinion and the methodology that CSCA used to
render its opinion, see the section entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Monmouth’s Financial Advisors-Opinion of
CSCA.”
Financing (see page 52)
The obligation of ILPT under the Merger Agreement to complete the Merger is not conditioned on ILPT’s obtaining
funds or financing.
The funds required to consummate the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the fees and
expenses associated with the acquisition and financing) will be obtained by one or more of the following:
•
debt financing committed by certain lenders, pursuant to a commitment letter, dated as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, to make available to ILPT a bridge loan, under which ILPT may borrow up to $4.0 billion
on a short-term basis for 364 days, or alternative financing as permitted under the Merger Agreement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
an equity contribution through investments by equity partners; and/or
•
other funds available to ILPT, including through alternative or substitute financing.
Interests of Monmouth’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger (see page 53)
In considering the recommendation of Monmouth’s board of directors to approve the Merger, Monmouth’s
shareholders should be aware that Monmouth’s directors and executive officers have certain interests in the Merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Monmouth’s shareholders generally, including the receipt
of consideration in exchange for cancellation of outstanding unvested equity awards, the receipt of contractual
severance and/or transaction bonus payments by certain executive officers, and the right to continued
indemnification and insurance coverage. For a description of these interests, see the information provided in the
section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Monmouth’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
Regulatory Matters (see page 58)
Monmouth is unaware of any material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required
for the completion of the Merger, other than the acceptance for record of the articles of merger by the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland and certificate of merger by the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, in each case with respect to the Merger.
Voting Agreement (see page 58)
In connection with the Merger, Mr. Eugene W. Landy, the Chairman of Monmouth’s board of directors, and Mr.
Michael P. Landy, Monmouth’s President and Chief Executive Officer, have entered into a voting agreement with ILPT
pursuant to which, in their capacity as shareholders, they have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of such
voting agreement, to vote their shares of Monmouth Common Stock in favor of the Merger. The shares of Monmouth
Common Stock subject to the voting agreement represent approximately 3% of the outstanding voting power of
Monmouth Common Stock as of the record date for the Special Meeting.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 58)
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties will treat the Merger as a taxable sale by Monmouth of all of
Monmouth’s assets to ILPT in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the Preferred Stock Consideration, the
assumption of all of Monmouth’s liabilities and any other applicable amounts, followed immediately by the
distribution of such Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock Consideration (and any other applicable amounts) to
the holders of equity interests in Monmouth in complete liquidation of Monmouth pursuant to Revenue Ruling 69-6,
1969-1 C.B. 104, Section 331(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and Section 562(b)(1) of the Code.
Because, as a REIT, Monmouth is entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating distributions, and Monmouth
anticipates that its deemed liquidating distribution will exceed its taxable income recognized as a result of the Merger
(together with any other undistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the Merger), Monmouth
anticipates that it will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
For further discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see “The Merger-Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Dividends (see page 61)
The Merger Agreement permits Monmouth to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends on the outstanding shares of
Monmouth Common Stock in an amount not exceeding $0.18 per share for each completed quarter until the
consummation of the Merger, quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding Monmouth Preferred Stock in an amount
equal to $0.3828125 per share, and distributions reasonably necessary for Monmouth to maintain its REIT status and
avoid or reduce the imposition of any entity level income or excise tax under the Code (or applicable state law).
In the event that Monmouth declares or pays any dividend or other distribution that is reasonably necessary to
maintain its REIT status and avoid or reduce the imposition of any entity level income or excise tax under the Code
(or applicable state law) in excess of the permitted $0.18 per share of Monmouth Common Stock per quarter, such
excess amount will reduce the Merger Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Delisting and Deregistration of Monmouth Common Stock and Preferred Stock (see page 61)
After the Merger is completed, the shares of Monmouth Common Stock and Monmouth Preferred Stock currently
listed on the NYSE will cease to be listed on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.
Litigation Relating to the Merger (see page 62)
Beginning on December 13, 2021, purported shareholders of Monmouth filed two lawsuits against Monmouth and
members of Monmouth’s board of directors, challenging disclosures related to the Merger. The complaints (the
“Complaints”), Wang v. Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, et al., No. 1:21-cv-10632 (S.D.N.Y.) and
Whitfield v. Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, et al., No. 1:21-cv-10854 (S.D.N.Y.), allege, among other
things, that Monmouth and its directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder and that Monmouth’s directors violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by causing the filing of a proxy
statement relating to the Merger with the SEC that misstates or omits certain allegedly material information.
The Complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the consummation of the Merger, rescission of
the Merger to the extent implemented (or rescissory damages), accounting for damages, declaration that Monmouth
and its directors violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, and an award of
the plaintiff’s costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees. Monmouth believes that all of the claims asserted in the
Complaints are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against such actions. However, litigation is inherently
uncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that the defense of the actions will be successful. If
the lawsuits are successful, they could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in costs to Monmouth.
Additional lawsuits relating to the Merger may also be filed in the future.

MONMOUTH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT CORP_20211221_DEFM14A_19731738_4356032.Pdf,The Merger Agreement,"The Merger Agreement
Form and Timing of the Merger (see page 67)
The Merger Agreement provides that under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Monmouth will
merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ILPT.
The Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at 8:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the fifth business day (the “Closing Date”) after the day on which the last of the closing conditions to
be satisfied or waived (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied or waived until the Closing) is
satisfied or waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the “Condition Satisfaction Date”). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties may agree on another time or date. In addition, in the event that the closing conditions are
satisfied or waived such that the Closing Date would otherwise occur prior to the date that is 90 days after the date of
the Merger Agreement (February 3, 2022), ILPT has the right to extend the Closing Date once to a date that is no later
than February 3, 2022 by providing written notice to Monmouth no later than the Condition Satisfaction Date. If the
closing conditions are satisfied or waived such that the Closing Date would otherwise occur on or after February 3,
2022, ILPT does not have the right to extend the Closing Date. ILPT also has the right to accelerate the then-
scheduled Closing Date to a date specified by ILPT by giving at least three business days written notice to
Monmouth at any time after the Condition Satisfaction Date.
Merger Consideration (see page 67)
At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Monmouth Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Monmouth, ILPT or Merger Sub) will be
converted into the right to receive $21.00 in cash, without interest, subject to any applicable withholding tax.
At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Monmouth Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Monmouth, ILPT or Merger Sub) will be
converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the
Closing Date.
6TABLE OF CONTENTS
Nonsolicitation and Recommendation Withdrawal (see page 79)
The Merger Agreement restricts Monmouth’s ability to solicit competing takeover proposals from third parties, to
discuss or negotiate with a third party regarding any competing takeover proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing takeover proposal, or to furnish to any
person any non-public material information in connection with any competing takeover proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing takeover proposal. In
addition, the Merger Agreement restricts the ability of Monmouth’s board of directors to change its recommendation
that the holders of Monmouth Common Stock approve the Merger.
Notwithstanding this obligation, at any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s common
shareholders, Monmouth may under certain circumstances furnish information with respect to Monmouth and its
subsidiaries to a person or group making a competing takeover proposal or participate in discussions or negotiations
with a person or group making a competing takeover proposal, in each case in response to an unsolicited written
competing takeover proposal received after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not arise as a result of a
material breach of Monmouth’s nonsolicitation obligations, if Monmouth’s board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with Monmouth’s financial advisors and its outside legal counsel) that such a proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal and that the failure to take such actions would, or
would be reasonably likely to, be inconsistent with its directors’ duties under applicable law. Monmouth’s board of
directors may also change its recommendation that the holders of Monmouth Common Stock approve the Merger in
certain circumstances.
Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 81)
The respective obligations of Monmouth, ILPT and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction
or, to the extent permitted by law, waiver, on or prior to the Closing Date, of the following conditions:
•
Approval by Monmouth’s common shareholders of the Merger;
•
Absence of any law, regulation, temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order issued by a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction after the date of the Merger Agreement
that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Merger;
•
Accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties, subject to customary materiality and material
adverse effect qualifications with respect to certain representations and warranties;
•
The other party’s performance or compliance in all material respects with all agreements and covenants
required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement prior to the Closing;
•
Receipt of a certificate from an executive officer of the other party confirming the satisfaction of the two
immediately preceding conditions; and
•
In the case of ILPT and Merger Sub, receipt of a tax opinion of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP or other
nationally recognized tax counsel to Monmouth, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, for all
taxable periods of Monmouth commencing with Monmouth’s taxable year that ended on September 30,
2017, (i) Monmouth has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT under the Code and (ii) Monmouth’s prior, current and proposed ownership,
organization and method of operation have enabled Monmouth to continue to meet the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code (A) for all such taxable periods through and including
its most recently completed taxable year and (B) for its final taxable year commencing immediately after the
end of its most recently completed taxable year and concluding with (and inclusive of) the Effective Time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 82)
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the approval
of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders:
•
by mutual written consent of ILPT and Monmouth;
•
by either ILPT or Monmouth, if the Merger is not consummated on or before May 5, 2022 (the “Outside
Date”), provided that a party whose breach of any of its regulatory efforts obligations has been a principal
cause of the failure of the Merger to be consummated by the Outside Date may not invoke this termination
right;
•
by either ILPT or Monmouth, if, after the date of the Merger Agreement, any governmental entity of
competent jurisdiction issues an order or takes any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or

of such order or action may not invoke this termination right;

by either ILPT or Monmouth, if the approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders is not
obtained upon a vote taken thereon at a meeting of Monmouth’s shareholders (or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof);
•
by either ILPT or Monmouth, if the other party has breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, generally subject to a 45 day
cure period, and such breach or failure to perform would result in a failure of a closing condition with
respect to representations and warranties and covenants, provided that a party may not invoke this
termination right if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
under the Merger Agreement;
•
before the approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders, by ILPT, if Monmouth’s board of
directors or any committee thereof withholds, withdraws (or modified or qualifies in a manner adverse to
ILPT) the recommendation that the holders of Monmouth Common Stock approve the Merger, fails to
include such recommendation in the proxy statement, authorize, approve, adopt or recommend any
competing takeover proposal, fails to recommend against any then-pending tender or exchange offer that
constitutes a competing takeover proposal within certain specified time periods, or, upon ILPT’s written
request, fails to reaffirm, upon certain specified circumstances and within certain specified time periods, its
recommendation that Monmouth’s common shareholders approve the Merger; or
•
before the approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders, by Monmouth in order to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior takeover proposal, subject to certain requirements.
Upon a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, Monmouth will be required to pay ILPT a
termination fee of $72 million or reimburse ILPT for all its out-of-pocket expenses up to $10 million.
Certain Sales Activities (see page 75)
Monmouth has agreed to use reasonable best efforts (including causing its subsidiaries and representatives to use
their respective reasonable best efforts) to provide to ILPT all pre-closing cooperation reasonably requested by ILPT
in writing in connection with any sales or marketing efforts relating to potential sales of Monmouth’s real properties,
subject to certain limitations.

beneficially owned approximately 3,672,966 shares of Monmouth Common Stock, which represented approximately

No Appraisal Rights (see page 66)
Holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock or Monmouth Preferred Stock are not entitled to exercise any
appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting shareholder to receive the fair value of the
shareholder’s shares in connection with the Merger because, as permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law,
Monmouth’s charter provides that shareholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless Monmouth’s board of
directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire board of directors, determines that the rights will apply
to the Merger. Monmouth’s board of directors has made no such determination and the Merger Agreement provides
that no such rights will be available. In addition, under the Maryland General Corporation Law, holders of shares
listed on a securities exchange generally are also not entitled to such rights. However, holders of shares of
Monmouth Common Stock can vote against the Merger.

Date. To review in greater detail the reasons of Monmouth’s board of directors for recommending that

Q:
How does Monmouth’s board of directors recommend that Monmouth’s shareholders vote on the proposals?
A:
After careful consideration, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger
Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in

other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (iii) authorized the execution and delivery of the

For a more complete description of the recommendation of Monmouth’s board of directors, see the section
entitled “The Merger-Recommendation of Monmouth’s Board of Directors and Its Reasons for the Merger.”
Q:
Do any of Monmouth’s executive officers or directors have interests in the Merger that may differ from those
of its shareholders?
A:
Monmouth’s executive officers and directors have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition
to, their interests as our shareholders. The members of Monmouth’s board of directors were aware of and
considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in
recommending that Monmouth’s shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal. For a description of these
interests, see the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of Monmouth’s Executive Officers and Directors in the
Merger.”
Q:
Are there any conditions to the Closing that must be satisfied for the Merger to be completed?
A:
In addition to the approval of the Merger Proposal by Monmouth’s shareholders, there are a number of
customary conditions that must be satisfied or waived for the Merger to be consummated. For a description of
all of the conditions to the Merger, see “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to Completion of the Merger.”
Q:
If my shares of Monmouth Common Stock are held in “street name” by my broker or other nominee, will my
broker or other nominee vote my shares of Monmouth Common Stock for me?
A:
If you hold your shares of Monmouth Common Stock in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by
a bank or nominee (that is, in “street name”), you must provide the record holder of your shares with
instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank, or
nominee. In order for any shares held in street name to be represented at the Special Meeting, you must provide
your broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares. Brokers who hold shares on behalf
of their customers may not give a proxy to vote those shares without specific instructions from their customers.
Q:
What will happen if I fail to vote or fail to instruct my broker, bank, or nominee how to vote?
A:
If you do not instruct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote your shares of Monmouth Common Stock,
your broker, bank or nominee may not vote your shares on the Merger Proposal, the Compensation
12
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Proposal, or the Adjournment Proposal and your shares will not be deemed to be present at the Special Meeting.
This will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal, but it will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, provided a quorum is otherwise present.
Q:
What will happen if I abstain from voting?
A:
If you abstain from voting it will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal, but it will have no
effect on the Compensation Proposal, or the Adjournment Proposal, provided a quorum is otherwise present.
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
A:
We expect to complete the Merger as soon as reasonably practicable following satisfaction of all of the required
conditions to closing the Merger; however, ILPT has the right to extend the Closing Date once to a date that is
no later than February 3, 2022. If Monmouth’s shareholders approve the Merger Proposal, and if the other
conditions to closing the Merger are satisfied or waived, it is currently expected that the Merger will be
completed in the first half of 2022. However, there is no guarantee that the conditions to closing the Merger will
be satisfied or that the Merger will close on this timing, or at all.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger is not approved by Monmouth’s shareholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other
reason, Monmouth’s shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Monmouth Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, Monmouth will remain a public company, and the Monmouth
Common Stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, and listed on the NYSE. Upon a
termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, Monmouth will be required to pay ILPT a
termination fee of $72 million or reimburse ILPT for all its out-of-pocket expenses up to $10 million. See “The
Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement-Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement.”
Q:
If I am a shareholder, do I need to do anything with my stock certificates now?
A:
No. You should not submit your stock certificates at this time. After the Merger is completed, if you held shares
of Monmouth Common Stock, the paying agent will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for
tendering your shares for cash pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon surrender of a certificate
or book-entry share for cancellation along with the executed letter of transmittal and other required documents
described in the instructions, shareholders will receive payment in cash pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement.
Q:
What are the anticipated U.S. federal income tax consequences to me of the Merger?
A:
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the
particular tax consequences to you of the Merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the
application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). For further discussion, see “The
Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
Are shareholders entitled to appraisal rights?
A:
No. Shareholders are not entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. See “No Appraisal
Rights” for more information.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
After you have carefully read this proxy statement, please respond by completing, signing, and dating your
proxy card or voting instruction card and returning it in the enclosed preaddressed postage-paid envelope or, if
available, by submitting your proxy by one of the other methods specified in your proxy card or voting
instruction card as promptly as possible so that your shares of Monmouth Common Stock will be represented
and voted at the Special Meeting.
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Please refer to your proxy card or voting instruction card forwarded by your broker, bank or other nominee to
see which voting options are available to you.
The method by which you submit a proxy will in no way limit your right to vote at the Special Meeting, if you
later decide to attend the Special Meeting in virtual format.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Monmouth Common Stock before the Special Meeting?
A:
If you held shares of Monmouth Common Stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the Effective Time,
you will retain your right to vote at the Special Meeting, but not the right to receive the Merger Consideration
for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when the Merger becomes effective will pass to the
person who at that time owns the shares you previously owned.
Q:
How will my proxy be voted?
A:
All shares of Monmouth Common Stock entitled to vote and represented by properly completed proxies
received prior to the Special Meeting, and not revoked, will be voted at the Special Meeting as instructed on the
proxies. If you properly sign, date and return a proxy card, but do not indicate how your shares of Monmouth
Common Stock should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your proxy will be voted as Monmouth’s
board of directors recommends, and therefore “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Compensation Proposal,
and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other
nominee, your shares of Monmouth Common Stock will NOT be voted or represented at the Special Meeting.
Q:
Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
A:
Yes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the Special
Meeting. If you are a holder of record, you can do this in any of the four following ways:
•
entering a new vote by Internet or by telephone;
•
completing and returning a later-dated proxy card;
•
sending a written notice to Monmouth’s corporate secretary in time to be received before the Special
Meeting stating that you would like to revoke your proxy; or
•
attending and voting at the Special Meeting (although attendance at the Special Meeting will not, by itself,
revoke a proxy).
If your shares of Monmouth Common Stock are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee and you
desire to change your vote or vote in person, your broker, bank or other nominee can provide you with
instructions on how to change or revoke your vote.
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the Special Meeting?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the Special Meeting, including multiple copies of this
proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares of
Monmouth Common Stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction
card for each brokerage account in which you hold your shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares of
Monmouth Common Stock are registered in more than one name, you may receive more than one proxy card.
Please complete, sign, date, and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive or, if
available, please submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
Within four business days following certification of the final voting results, Monmouth intends to file a Current
Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing the final voting results of the Special Meeting. If final voting results
are not available to Monmouth in time to file a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the
Special Meeting, Monmouth will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and will provide
the final results in an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K as soon as they become available.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Have any shareholders entered into a voting agreement in connection with the Merger?
A:
Yes. Mr. Eugene W. Landy, the Chairman of Monmouth’s board of directors, and Mr. Michael P. Landy,
Monmouth’s President and Chief Executive Officer, have entered into a voting agreement with ILPT, pursuant to
which, in their capacity as shareholders, they have agreed to vote their shares of Monmouth Common Stock,
which represent approximately 3% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of Monmouth Common
Stock as of the record date for the Special Meeting, in favor of the Merger. See “The Merger-Voting Agreement.”
Q:
Will a proxy solicitor be used?
A:
Yes. Monmouth has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc. (“MacKenzie Partners”) to assist in the solicitation of
proxies for the Special Meeting. Monmouth estimates that it will pay MacKenzie Partners a fee of approximately
$350,000. Monmouth has also agreed to reimburse MacKenzie Partners for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
and disbursements incurred in connection with the proxy solicitation and to indemnify MacKenzie Partners
against certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses. In addition to mailing proxy solicitation material,
Monmouth’s directors, officers, and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by any other
electronic means of communication deemed appropriate. No additional compensation will be paid to
Monmouth’s directors, officers, or employees for such services.

Some of the statements contained in this proxy statement constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, statements regarding consummating the Merger and the
timing thereof. Any forward-looking statements contained in this proxy statement are intended to be made pursuant
to the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations,

forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,”
“believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or
phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical
matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions.
The forward-looking statements contained in this proxy statement reflect Monmouth’s current views about future
events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in
circumstances that may cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking
statement, including, without limitation:
•
inability to complete the Merger because, among other reasons, one or more conditions to the closing of
the Merger may not be satisfied or waived;
•
uncertainty as to the timing of completion of the Merger;
•
potential adverse effects or changes to relationships with tenants, employees, service providers or other
parties resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger;
•
the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the
Merger Agreement;
•
possible disruptions from the Merger that could harm Monmouth’s business, including current plans and
operations;
•
availability and terms of financing, including ILPT’s financing for the Merger;
•
unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the Merger;
•
reduced demand for, or oversupply of, industrial and logistics space in Monmouth’s markets and other
conditions affecting the industries in which Monmouth operates;
•
legislative, regulatory and economic developments, including changes in tax, real estate, environmental,
zoning and other laws and regulations; and
•
unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism,
outbreak of war or hostilities and epidemics and pandemics, including COVID-19, as well as management’s
response to any of the aforementioned factors.
Monmouth does not guarantee that the Merger and events described in this proxy statement will happen as
described (or that they will happen at all). For a further discussion of other factors that could cause Monmouth’s
future results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in
Monmouth’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for subsequent
quarters.
While forward-looking statements reflect Monmouth’s good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future
performance. Monmouth disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to
reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future events or other
changes, except as required by law.

Monmouth is asking its common shareholders to vote on a proposal to approve the merger of Monmouth with and
into Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
For detailed information regarding the Merger Proposal, see the information about the Merger and the Merger

Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of
Monmouth Common Stock outstanding as of the record date for the Special Meeting. For approval of the Merger
Proposal, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN”. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by
telephone or through the Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or
“ABSTAIN” on the Merger Proposal, your shares of Monmouth Common Stock will be voted in accordance with the
recommendation of Monmouth’s board of directors, which is “FOR” the Merger Proposal. Because the required vote
for the Merger Proposal is based on the number of votes Monmouth common shareholders are entitled to cast rather
than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including failure to give voting instructions to your
broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposal.
If Monmouth common shareholders fail to approve the Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur.
Monmouth’s board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the approval of the Merger Proposal.

THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) under the
Exchange Act, Monmouth is asking its common shareholders to vote at the Special Meeting on an advisory basis
regarding the compensation that may be paid or become payable to its named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger. Information intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K concerning this
compensation, subject to certain assumptions described therein, is presented in the section entitled “The Merger-
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Monmouth’s Executive Officers.”
The common shareholder vote on executive compensation is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on
Monmouth, its board of directors or ILPT. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by
their terms, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the
Merger is completed, Monmouth’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that may be
paid or become payable to Monmouth’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger,
in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation. Approval of the Compensation
Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
Monmouth is asking its common shareholders to vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation (“Monmouth”) approve,
on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive
officers of Monmouth that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Monmouth’s
Executive Officers” beginning on page 56 (which disclosure includes the table required pursuant to Item 402(t)
of Regulation S-K).”
Required Vote and Board of Directors’ Recommendation
Adoption of the above resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis, requires, provided a quorum is present, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by
telephone or through the Internet, but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or
“ABSTAIN” on the Compensation Proposal, your shares of Monmouth Common Stock will be voted in accordance
with the recommendation of Monmouth’s board of directors, which is “FOR” the Compensation Proposal. An
abstention (which will count as present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum) or failure to vote on the
Compensation Proposal (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) will have
no effect on the approval of the Compensation Proposal, assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the Special
Meeting.
Monmouth’s board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Monmouth’s named executive officers that
is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger.

Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Merger Proposal.

Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires, provided a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast on the proposal. If you properly authorize your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet,

but do not indicate instructions to vote your shares “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on the Adjournment
Proposal, your shares of Monmouth Common Stock will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of
Monmouth’s board of directors, which is “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. An abstention (which will count as
present for purposes of determining presence of a quorum) or failure to vote on the Adjournment Proposal (including
failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) will have no effect on the approval of the
Adjournment Proposal, assuming a quorum is otherwise present at the Special Meeting.
Monmouth’s board of directors recommends that you vote “FOR” the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

The Special Meeting will be held in a virtual-only format on February 17, 2022, commencing at 11:00 a.m., Eastern
Time. The Special Meeting will be held online via a live webcast at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/
MNR2022SM.
To participate in the Special Meeting, you will need the control number included on your proxy card or the
instructions that accompanied your proxy materials. If you hold shares through a bank, broker or other institution,
you may contact that institution if you have questions about obtaining your control number. The Special Meeting
webcast will begin promptly at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Monmouth encourages you to access the meeting prior to the
start time. Online check-in will begin at 10:45 a.m. Eastern Time, and you should allow ample time for the check-in
procedures.
At the Special Meeting, the holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock will be asked to consider and vote upon
the following proposals:
1.
To approve the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “Merger Proposal”);
2.
To approve on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Monmouth’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby (the “Compensation Proposal”); and
3.
To approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the Merger Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
Shareholders must approve the Merger Proposal for the Merger to occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are described in
the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement.”
The vote on the Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Because
the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Monmouth. Accordingly, if the
Merger Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable,
subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and arrangements,
regardless of the outcome of the non-binding advisory vote on the Compensation Proposal.

After careful consideration, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement,
the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests
of Monmouth and its shareholders, (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (iii) authorized the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement.
Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously recommends that Monmouth’s shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger

Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of
Monmouth Common Stock outstanding on the record date.
21TABLE OF CONTENTS
Approval of the Compensation Proposal requires, provided a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of all votes cast on such proposal.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires, provided a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of all votes cast on such proposal. If a quorum is not present, the chair of the Special Meeting may adjourn
the Special Meeting. Adjournments and postponements are subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Merger
Agreement.
Regardless of the number of shares you own, your vote is important. Please complete, sign, date and promptly
return the enclosed proxy card today or vote by phone or Internet.
Monmouth’s Bylaws provide that, at a meeting of shareholders (including the Special Meeting), the presence, in
person or by proxy, of the shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting
will constitute a quorum. Shares that are voted and shares abstaining from voting will be treated as being present at
the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. The Bylaws further provide that,
whether or not a quorum is present, a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and present at a meeting of
shareholders, in person or by proxy, have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time to a date nor more than
120 days after the original record date without notice other than announcement at the meeting.
As of the record date for the Special Meeting, Monmouth’s directors and executive officers owned and are entitled to
vote an aggregate of approximately 3,672,966 shares of Monmouth Common Stock, entitling them to exercise
approximately 3.7% of the voting power of the shares of Monmouth Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. Monmouth’s directors and executive officers have informed Monmouth that they intend to vote the shares
of Monmouth Common Stock that they own in favor of the Merger Proposal, in favor of the Compensation Proposal,
and in favor of the Adjournment Proposal, although, other than Messrs. Eugene W. Landy and Michael P. Landy,
they have no obligation to do so. Messrs. Eugene W. Landy and Michael P. Landy have entered into a voting
agreement with ILPT, pursuant to which, in their capacity as shareholders, they have agreed to vote their shares of
Monmouth Common Stock, which represent approximately 3% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of
Monmouth Common Stock as of the record date for the Special Meeting, in favor of the Merger. See “The Merger-
Voting Agreement.”

MONMOUTH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT CORP_20211221_DEFM14A_19731738_4356032.Pdf,Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes,"Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
Because the required vote at the Special Meeting for the Merger Proposal is based on the number of votes entitled to
be cast rather than on the number of votes cast on such proposal, abstentions will have the same effect as votes
AGAINST such proposal. Abstentions will have no effect on either the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal, provided a quorum is otherwise present.
Under NYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-
votes at the Special Meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker or other nominee are
represented at a meeting, but the broker or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial
owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal but has
discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if you own shares of Monmouth
Common Stock through a broker or other nominee (i.e., in “street name”), you must provide voting instructions as
described in “The Special Meeting-Voting-Shares Held in ‘Street Name’” in order to have your shares voted at the
Special Meeting. Because the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of
the shares of Monmouth Common Stock outstanding on the record date, the failure to provide your broker or other
nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” such proposal. The failure to
provide your broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or
the Adjournment Proposal, provided a quorum is otherwise present.

If you are a holder of record of shares of Monmouth Common Stock on the record date and you fail to return your
proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet, unless you attend the Special Meeting and vote directly, your
shares will NOT be considered present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present and will NOT be voted. This will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the Merger Proposal and,
assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, Monmouth recommends that you also vote by proxy so that your
vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Special Meeting.
Shares Held in “Street Name”
If your shares of Monmouth Common Stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street
name,” you will receive voting instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee. You must follow the voting
instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on
how to vote your shares. Street name shareholders should generally be able to vote by returning a voting instruction
form and may be able to vote by telephone or on the Internet, depending on the voting process of your broker, bank
or other nominee.
If your shares of Monmouth Common Stock are held in “street name” and you fail to provide your broker, bank, or
other nominee with instructions regarding how to vote your shares, your shares will NOT be considered present at

As a matter of course, Monmouth’s board of directors, management and outside advisors have regularly reviewed
and evaluated Monmouth’s strategic direction, financial performance, business plans, operations and portfolio in an
effort to maximize value to its shareholders. In so doing, Monmouth has identified, and at times pursued, potential
strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions.
On December 1, 2020, Blackwells, one of Monmouth’s shareholders, delivered a letter from Jason Aintabi,
Blackwells’s Founder and Chief Investment Officer, to Eugene Landy, Chairman of Monmouth’s board of directors,
and Michael Landy, Monmouth’s President and Chief Executive Officer, communicating an unsolicited, non-binding
preliminary proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Monmouth Common Stock in an all-cash transaction
at a price of $16.75 per share (the “Initial Blackwells Proposal”). On the date of the Initial Blackwells Proposal, shares
of Monmouth Common Stock closed at $14.80 per share on the NYSE. On December 8, 2020, a special meeting of
Monmouth’s board of directors was held to discuss the Initial Blackwells Proposal, attended by representatives of
Monmouth’s financial advisor, CSCA, and outside Maryland corporate counsel, Venable LLP (“Venable”). Following
that discussion, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously determined that the Initial Blackwells Proposal was not
in the best interests of Monmouth and, at the direction of Monmouth’s board of directors, Mr. Eugene Landy
conveyed the determination of the board of directors to Blackwells by letter.
On December 16, 2020, Monmouth entered into an engagement letter with CSCA under which CSCA would provide
general advisory services. Monmouth decided to engage CSCA based on, among other things, CSCA’s substantial
experience in the REIT industry and Monmouth’s long-standing relationship with CSCA.
After market close on December 18, 2020, Blackwells delivered a revised proposal to Messrs. Eugene Landy and
Michael Landy offering to pay $18.00 per share in cash to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Monmouth
Common Stock (the “Revised Blackwells Proposal”). On the date of the Revised Blackwells Proposal, shares of
Monmouth Common Stock closed at $16.99 per share on the NYSE.
On December 20, 2020, Bloomberg News published an article reporting that Blackwells had offered to acquire
Monmouth for $18.00 per share in cash, and on December 21, 2020, Blackwells issued a press release disclosing the
Revised Blackwells Proposal, including the full text of Mr. Aintabi’s December 18, 2020 letter that accompanied the
Revised Blackwells Proposal. Following publication of the Bloomberg News article and Blackwells’s press release, the
share price of Monmouth Common Stock increased $0.72 per share to a closing price of $17.71 per share on December
21, 2020. Also on December 21, 2020, Monmouth publicly disclosed its receipt of the two proposals from Blackwells.
On December 22, 2020, CSCA received an inquiry from a large private investment firm primarily focused on global real
estate, which we refer to as “Bidder A”, indicating an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Monmouth.
25TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 23, 2020, prior to receiving a response from Monmouth regarding the Revised Blackwells Proposal,
Blackwells delivered a written notice to Monmouth stating that it intended to nominate a slate of four director
candidates, including Monmouth’s former general counsel, to fill the four director seats up for election at
Monmouth’s 2021 annual meeting of shareholders. Blackwells also stated that it intended to submit six non-binding
proposals to be voted on by Monmouth’s shareholders at the 2021 annual meeting.
On January 13, 2021, Monmouth engaged J.P. Morgan as its additional financial advisor in connection with a possible
decision by its board of directors to explore strategic alternatives. Monmouth engaged J.P. Morgan based on J.P.
Morgan’s substantial industry knowledge, its experience with strategic alternatives processes for other real estate
companies and its prior experience working with Monmouth. Monmouth also entered into an additional engagement
letter with CSCA dated as of January 13, 2021, expanding the scope of CSCA’s engagement to include advising and
assisting in connection with a potential strategic alternatives review process.
On January 14, 2021, at its regular quarterly board meeting, Monmouth’s board of directors considered, among other
things, the Revised Blackwells Proposal. In addition to members of Monmouth’s management, in attendance for
portions of the meeting were representatives of CSCA, J.P. Morgan and Venable. Following various presentations by
advisors, Monmouth’s board of directors further discussed the Revised Blackwells Proposal and unanimously
determined that the Revised Blackwells Proposal was not in the best interests of Monmouth and, at the direction of
the board of directors, Mr. Eugene Landy wrote to Blackwells to inform them of the determination of the board of
directors. During the meeting, Monmouth’s board of directors also determined, following a presentation by
representatives of J.P. Morgan, that it would be in the best interests of Monmouth to explore potential strategic
alternatives, including a potential sale. To enable Monmouth’s board of directors to undertake that review in an
efficient manner, the board of directors decided to form a Strategic Alternatives Committee, consisting of four
directors, Messrs. K.C. Conway and Scott Robinson (each an independent director) and Messrs. Michael Landy and
Kevin Miller, which committee would support the review process and make recommendations to Monmouth’s board
of directors.
Also on January 14, 2021, Monmouth publicly disclosed its board of directors’ determinations to reject the Revised
Blackwells Proposal and to conduct a review of Monmouth’s potential strategic alternatives. Shortly following the
announcement, representatives of Bidder A contacted both CSCA and J.P. Morgan to reiterate Bidder A’s interest in
exploring a potential transaction.
Shortly after the January 14, 2021 meeting of the board of directors, at the request of Monmouth’s board of directors,
and with the assistance of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, Monmouth’s management began preparing a Confidential
Information Memorandum to be provided to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction. During this period, J.P.
Morgan and CSCA also received inquiries from a number of parties interested in participating in the strategic
alternatives process.
On January 20, 2021, Monmouth filed suit in state court in New Jersey against its former general counsel and
Blackwells seeking to bar its former general counsel from participating in the slate of directors nominated by
Blackwells. Blackwells subsequently sent a litigation demand to Monmouth, alleging that Monmouth’s board of
directors’ decisions to file suit, and not to appoint an independent committee to consider the Initial Blackwells
Proposal and the Revised Blackwells Proposal, was a breach of the board of directors’ fiduciary duties. Monmouth’s
board of directors thereupon created a committee of independent directors to review the demand with the assistance
of counsel.
On February 1, 2021, Monmouth and its advisors finalized a form non-disclosure agreement to be circulated to
potential counterparties. In addition, on February 1, 2021, J.P. Morgan and CSCA provided Monmouth with a draft list
of approximately 90 potential counterparties, including financial sponsors, real estate investment trusts, sovereign
wealth funds, pension funds, real estate managers and other financial and strategic investors that J.P. Morgan and
CSCA believed could potentially have an interest in a transaction with Monmouth and likely would have the
capability to consummate such a transaction. Subsequently, based on feedback from Monmouth, the advisors added
additional potential counterparties to the draft list.
Later on February 1, 2021, a meeting of the Strategic Alternatives Committee was convened. The Strategic
Alternatives Committee reviewed and discussed the potential counterparties that had been assembled by J.P. Morgan
and CSCA with input from Monmouth’s management, noting that the list included numerous credible strategic and
financial bidders. Following this discussion, the Strategic Alternatives Committee approved the proposed list.

On February 12, 2021, Monmouth engaged Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP (“Stroock”) to act as legal counsel to
Monmouth and its board of directors in connection with the strategic alternatives process.
Between February 2 and March 5, 2021, Monmouth and its advisors negotiated and executed non-disclosure
agreements (each a “Non-Disclosure Agreement” and collectively, the “Non-Disclosure Agreements”) with 36
potential counterparties that were contacted as part of the strategic alternatives review process, including with ILPT,
Equity Commonwealth (“EQC”) and Bidder A. The Non-Disclosure Agreements generally included customary
standstill restrictions on the counterparties but did not prohibit the counterparties from requesting that Monmouth
waive such standstill restrictions.
On March 16, 2021, Monmouth received four preliminary, non-binding proposals, including proposals from each of
EQC, ILPT, Bidder A, and a private owner and operator of industrial real estate in the United States, which we refer to
as “Bidder B.” The proposal submitted by EQC represented an all-stock transaction and provided for an exchange of
each share of Monmouth Common Stock for 0.571 EQC common shares, representing an implied value of $16.22 per
share based on the trading price of EQC’s common shares at the time of EQC’s March 16 proposal. The proposals
submitted by ILPT, Bidder A and Bidder B contemplated all-cash transactions with per share offer prices of $19.25,
$18.30 and $19.50, respectively. None of the four preliminary proposals received by Monmouth addressed the ability
of Monmouth to pay dividends in respect of Monmouth Common Stock during the period between the execution of a
definitive agreement and the closing. Each of ILPT, EQC, Bidder A and Bidder B were invited to continue to
participate in the next stage of the strategic alternatives process.
Before the deadline for the submission of revised proposals, various telephone calls and e-mails were exchanged
between Monmouth and its advisors, on the one hand, and representatives of each of ILPT, EQC, Bidder A and
Bidder B regarding diligence and process matters. Additionally, during this period, ILPT, EQC and Bidder A also
conducted tours of a large number of Monmouth’s properties.
On April 20, 2021, EQC and ILPT delivered revised proposals and, the following morning on April 21, 2021, Bidder A
submitted a revised proposal. Bidder B did not submit a revised proposal. ILPT’s revised proposal consisted of an all-
cash offer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock at a price of $18.50 per share. ILPT’s offer noted that
Monmouth may not pay any dividends to holders of Monmouth Common Stock between signing of the merger
agreement and the closing of the merger. EQC’s revised proposal provided for an all-stock transaction in which each
share of Monmouth Common Stock would be exchanged for 0.6638 EQC common shares, representing an implied
value of $19.15 per share based on EQC’s closing stock price of $28.85 per share on April 20, 2021 and, when added to
the $0.18 per share dividend payable to holders of Monmouth Common Stock on June 15, 2021 that had been
previously declared by Monmouth’s board of directors, would result in an effective price of $19.33 per share of
Monmouth Common Stock in light of EQC’s expressed willingness to permit Monmouth to pay the previously
declared dividend and to refrain from paying a matching pre-merger cash dividend to EQC’s common stockholders in
respect of such previously declared $0.18 per share dividend. Bidder A’s revised proposal consisted of an all-cash
offer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock for a price of $19.00 per share. Bidder A’s revised proposal
prohibited the payment of any dividends to holders of Monmouth Common Stock between signing and closing of the
merger, which would include the $0.18 per share dividend payable on June 15, 2021 previously declared by
Monmouth’s board of directors, other than dividends necessary to maintain Monmouth’s REIT qualification, and
required that the stated price of $19.00 per share be reduced by the amount of any such REIT qualification dividends
paid between signing and closing of the merger. The Strategic Alternatives Committee determined that an additional
round of bidding was advisable, and that each of ILPT, EQC and Bidder A should be invited to submit “best and
final” offers the following week.
On April 23, 2021, ILPT informed J.P. Morgan that it was withdrawing from the process, explaining that it was not in a
position to improve its proposal.
On April 28, 2021, EQC and Bidder A each submitted best and final proposals. EQC’s final proposal consisted of an
all-stock offer with 0.67 EQC shares to be issued in exchange for each share of Monmouth Common Stock, resulting
in a base offer price of $19.08 per share based on EQC’s closing stock price of $28.48 on April 27, 2021. In addition,
EQC’s final proposal (including the revised draft merger agreement
27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
attached thereto) provided for up to $0.36 of additional value to the holders of Monmouth Common Stock by
allowing Monmouth to pay the $0.18 per share regular quarterly common stock dividend that had been declared in
April 2021, and to declare and pay an additional $0.18 per share regular quarterly common dividend prior the closing
of the merger, without EQC declaring or paying a matching pre-merger cash dividend to EQC’s shareholders. Bidder
A’s final proposal was an all-cash offer to acquire all shares of Monmouth Common Stock at a stated price of $19.51
per share. Bidder A’s proposal provided that the per share price to be paid in the merger would be reduced by the
amount of any dividends declared or paid by Monmouth on shares of Monmouth Common Stock between signing
and closing of the merger, including the $0.18 per share dividend payable on June 15, 2021 previously declared by
Monmouth’s board of directors.
Also on April 28, 2021, several meetings of the Strategic Alternatives Committee and Monmouth’s board of directors
were held to discuss the final proposals received from EQC and Bidder A. Following extensive discussions involving
Monmouth’s advisors, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously approved the Strategic Alternatives Committee’s
recommendation to accept the EQC draft merger agreement and final proposal, subject to finalizing documentation.
Between April 28 and May 4, 2021, Mr. Michael Landy, and representatives from J.P. Morgan, CSCA, Stroock, EQC
and EQC’s financial and legal advisors negotiated the merger agreement, and final confirmatory due diligence was
completed.
Additional meetings of Monmouth’s board of directors were held on April 30, 2021 to hear presentations by J.P.
Morgan and CSCA with respect to their preliminary valuation analyses of the economic terms of the proposed
transaction with EQC and on May 4, 2021 to consider approval of the merger agreement. Following the delivery of
oral fairness opinions by each of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, and an update on the terms and status of the merger
agreement by Stroock, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving the merger
agreement and related matters. Later in the evening on May 4, 2021, Monmouth entered into a merger agreement with
EQC and issued a joint press release regarding Monmouth’s proposed merger with EQC.
Among the Non-Disclosure Agreements, the standstill restrictions in nine Non-Disclosure Agreements expired by
their terms upon Monmouth’s execution of the merger agreement with EQC. Following the execution of the merger
agreement with EQC, Monmouth notified the counterparties for the remaining 26 Non-Disclosure Agreements that
Monmouth was granting an irrevocable waiver of the standstill restrictions to permit the counterparties to submit a
proposal, inquiry or indication of interest regarding a possible transaction to Monmouth’s board of directors and to
make a public announcement of any such proposal, inquiry or indication of interest, so long as, in any such case,
such counterparties did not engage in discussions or negotiations, or enter into any agreements or understandings,
whether or not legally enforceable, with any third party (excluding the counterparty’s affiliates and representatives)
with respect to any such proposal, inquiry or indication of interest.
On July 8, 2021, J.P. Morgan and CSCA received a letter from Starwood Capital Group (“Starwood”) setting forth an
unsolicited proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of Monmouth Common Stock for net cash consideration of
approximately $18.70 per share, reflecting a stated purchase price of $19.51 per share reduced by the termination fee
payable to EQC under the merger agreement executed on May 4, 2021 and the $0.18 per share dividend on shares of
Monmouth Common Stock declared by Monmouth’s board of directors on July 1, 2021. On July 15, Starwood
delivered an amended proposal, reflecting an increase of $0.18 per share in the consideration that would be paid for
shares of Monmouth Common Stock, resulting in a net cash consideration of $18.88 per share, reflecting a stated
purchase price of $19.51 per share reduced only by the termination fee payable to EQC (with no reduction for the
$0.18 per share dividend previously declared by Monmouth’s board of directors on July 1, 2021). On July 21, 2021, a
special meeting of Monmouth’s board of directors was convened for the purpose of discussing the July 8, 2021
Starwood proposal, as amended on July 15, 2021, and determining a response. Following such discussion,
Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously reaffirmed its support for, and recommendation in favor of, the then-
pending merger with EQC.
On July 29, 2021, the committee that Monmouth’s board of directors had appointed to review the litigation demand
served by Blackwells advised the board of directors that it had completed its work and that it recommended that
Monmouth not file suit against its board of directors. The committee determined, among other
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
things, that Monmouth did not have a duty to establish a special committee to review Blackwells’s offer, and that the
board of directors had appropriately considered the potential benefits and harms of pursuing litigation against its
former general counsel and Blackwells before doing so. Monmouth’s board of directors accepted this
recommendation.
Between July 27, 2021 and August 13, 2021, members of management of EQC and of Monmouth, and representatives
of each party’s financial, legal and proxy advisors, periodically discussed the status of the proposed merger with EQC
and the related proxy solicitations. On August 13, 2021, representatives of EQC submitted an offer letter to
Monmouth proposing certain revisions to the existing terms of the merger agreement, including (1) an increase in the
merger consideration to $19.00 for each share of Monmouth Common Stock by increasing the exchange ratio from
0.67 EQC shares per share of Monmouth Common Stock to 0.713 EQC shares per share of Monmouth Common Stock,
which represented a 6.4% premium over the existing all-stock transaction based on the closing price of EQC’s
common shares on August 13, 2021 of $26.65, and (2) the option for Monmouth shareholders to elect to receive such
consideration in the form of cash, EQC common shares or a combination of cash and EQC common shares, in each
case, subject to proration based upon a maximum cash amount. The terms of EQC’s revised proposal with respect to
payment of dividends on shares of Monmouth Common Stock were consistent with the provisions of the original
merger agreement Monmouth entered into with EQC.
Following receipt of EQC’s offer letter, members of management of EQC and of Monmouth, and representatives of
each party’s financial and legal advisors, conducted negotiations concerning the terms of an amended merger
agreement. Monmouth’s board of directors also met on August 13, 2021 and twice on August 15, 2021 to discuss
EQC’s offer letter and the proposed amended merger agreement. Following the delivery of new oral fairness opinions
by each of J.P. Morgan and CSCA with respect to the revised financial terms of the transaction and an update on the
terms and status of the amended merger agreement by Stroock, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously
approved the execution of an amended merger agreement with EQC and recommended that Monmouth’s shareholders
approve the merger with EQC on the amended terms at a special meeting of shareholders scheduled for August 31,
2021. In the evening of August 15, 2021, Monmouth and EQC executed the amended merger agreement and on the
morning of August 16, 2021, Monmouth and EQC issued a joint press release announcing entry into the amended
merger agreement with EQC.
On August 18, 2021, Monmouth received a new revised unsolicited acquisition proposal from Starwood. Starwood’s
revised proposal provided for net cash consideration of approximately $19.20 per share of Monmouth Common Stock.
This revised offer represented a stated per share purchase price of $19.93 per share, reduced by the termination fee
that would be payable to EQC if Monmouth terminated the amended merger agreement with EQC (with no reduction
for the $0.18 per share dividend previously declared by Monmouth’s board of directors on July 1, 2021). On August
23, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth’s board of directors was convened for the purpose of discussing and
determining what action(s) to take in response to the revised Starwood proposal. Following such discussion,
Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously decided to reaffirm its support for the then-pending merger with EQC,
and Monmouth issued a press release announcing this decision on August 23, 2021.
On August 31, 2021, at a special meeting of Monmouth’s shareholders held for purposes of voting on the proposed
merger with EQC, the holders of Monmouth’s common shares did not approve Monmouth’s proposed merger with
EQC as required by Maryland law and the terms of Monmouth’s charter. Later on August 31, 2021, Monmouth
received a written notice from EQC terminating the amended merger agreement as a result of the failure of
Monmouth’s shareholders to approve the merger and requesting reimbursement of its out-of-pocket fees and
expenses pursuant to the terms of the amended merger agreement. Subsequently, after receiving documentation
relating to such out-of-pocket fees and expenses from EQC, Monmouth reimbursed EQC in accordance with the terms
of the amended merger agreement. Blackwells subsequently indicated to Monmouth that Monmouth should convene
an annual meeting of its shareholders.
On September 7, 2021, Monmouth engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”) to act as legal
counsel to Monmouth and its board of directors in connection with its determination of what action(s) to take
following the termination of the amended merger agreement with EQC.
On September 13, 2021, Monmouth issued a press release announcing that it was re-initiating the process of
exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger, joint ventures, and changes in the capital
29
TABLE OF CONTENTS
structure of Monmouth, and that it would consider all viable proposals, including proposals submitted by Starwood
or other potential counterparties. Monmouth also announced that it would set meeting and record dates for
Monmouth’s annual meeting of shareholders in due course.
On September 14, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth’s board of directors was held to discuss the timeline for the
renewed strategic alternatives process, potential counterparties and engagement with shareholders. In light of the
fact that Monmouth had previously run a strategic alternatives process with numerous potential counterparties and
entered into, and made significant public disclosure in connection with, the EQC transaction, which had since been
terminated, Monmouth’s board of directors determined to proceed with the renewed strategic alternatives process on
an accelerated timetable, in order to determine in short order whether an alternative transaction that would provide for
an acquisition of the whole company could be achieved on terms that would be in the best interests of Monmouth
and its shareholders. In addition, the board of directors determined that the renewed strategic alternatives process
would be overseen by the board of directors as a whole (and not the Strategic Alternatives Committee (which
committee was disbanded)).
Beginning on September 15, 2021, based on indications of interest gathered during the initial outreach to
counterparties in February 2021, Monmouth’s management and its financial and legal advisors finalized a list of
potential counterparties for the renewed strategic alternatives process and initiated contact with 22 potential
counterparties. All of the counterparties who had submitted a bid during the prior strategic alternatives process were
invited to participate in the renewed strategic alternatives process. Of the 22 potential counterparties, eight expressed
interest in participating in the renewed strategic alternatives process and were granted access to Monmouth’s virtual
dataroom to conduct due diligence. Five of the counterparties granted access to the virtual dataroom had already
executed Non-Disclosure Agreements with Monmouth as part of the prior strategic alternatives process, and three
counterparties executed new Non-Disclosure Agreements, which included customary standstill restrictions on the
counterparties but did not prohibit the counterparties from requesting that Monmouth waive such standstill
restrictions. All counterparties were advised to submit indicative proposals by October 5, 2021. When invited to
participate in the process, Blackwells indicated it would not be submitting an offer for Monmouth and declined to
participate.
Between September 15, 2021 and October 4, 2021, members of Monmouth’s management and its financial advisors
held a number of due diligence sessions with, and responded to documentary diligence requests from, the interested
potential counterparties in the renewed strategic alternatives process.
On September 21, 2021, Monmouth engaged CBRE, Inc. (“CBRE”) to assist in Monmouth’s exploration of joint
venture alternatives. From its engagement until the execution of the Merger Agreement on November 5, 2021, CBRE
reached out to and engaged with various potential joint venture partners.
On September 23, 2021, counsel for Blackwells wrote to counsel for Monmouth demanding that Monmouth file suit
against Mr. Eugene Landy and other directors for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the matters
raised in Blackwells’s prior litigation demand and the now-terminated EQC merger agreement. Counsel for Blackwells
also demanded that Monmouth provide notice to shareholders of the date of its annual meeting by September 29,
2021. Also on September 23, 2021, Blackwells submitted to Monmouth a revised notice of its intention to nominate a
new slate of four director candidates, which did not include Monmouth’s former general counsel. Blackwells also
stated that it intended to submit seven revised non-binding proposals to be voted on by Monmouth’s shareholders
at Monmouth’s 2021 annual meeting.
Between September and November 2021, representatives of Monmouth and Blackwells had periodic discussions
regarding Blackwells’s proposals and its perspectives on Monmouth and a potential resolution of Blackwells’s
campaign.
On October 5, 2021, Monmouth received preliminary, non-binding proposals from ILPT and two other counterparties,
which we refer to as “Bidder 1” and “Bidder 2.” ILPT proposed to acquire Monmouth in an all-cash transaction for
$19.25 per share. The proposals submitted by Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 represented all-cash acquisitions of Monmouth
for net consideration of $19.30 and $19.75 per share, respectively. ILPT and Bidder 1 indicated that they were ready to
enter into definitive agreements for the acquisition within a short period of time, whereas Bidder 2 indicated that it
would need more time to undertake further due diligence. The bidders also indicated that they were exploring the
possibility of providing an option to elect non-cash consideration for
30
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a portion of the transaction consideration. Bidder 1 indicated that it would permit Monmouth to pay its regular
quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, prorated until closing, without any reduction in the merger
consideration, while ILPT’s and Bidder 2’s proposals did not specify the treatment of dividends.
On October 6, 2021, Mr. Eugene Landy called Mr. John Murray, ILPT's Managing Trustee, President, and Chief
Executive Officer, to encourage ILPT to advance its participation in the renewed strategic alternatives process.
Later on October 6, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth’s board of directors was held to discuss the indicative
proposals received from the three potential counterparties, attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, CSCA, and
Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton and of J.P. Morgan updated the board of directors on the
progress of the strategic alternatives process to date, structural options for a potential transaction, and possible
business and financial alternatives, such as a joint venture. Following discussion of the merits of various strategic
alternatives, including remaining an independent company, joint venture, and a sale of Monmouth, Monmouth’s
board of directors unanimously authorized Monmouth and its advisors to continue with the strategic alternatives
process and engagement with the three counterparties. The duties of the board of directors were also discussed by
representatives of Wachtell Lipton.
On October 7, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, acting at the direction of Monmouth’s board of
directors, called representatives of ILPT, Bidder 1, and Bidder 2 to advise them that while Monmouth expected that
they would have to increase their proposed prices in order to enter into a transaction, they would be invited into the
second round of the renewed strategic alternatives process. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA also provided
all three potential counterparties with a draft of a merger agreement prepared by Wachtell Lipton. The counterparties
were advised to submit revised drafts of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton by October 22, 2021 for an
opportunity to receive feedback in advance of their final bids, and to submit final proposals by November 1, 2021.
Also on October 7, 2021, Monmouth filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that it had set
December 16, 2021, as the date for the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, and that October 17, 2021 was the
deadline for the submission of shareholder notices of business to be considered at that meeting.
Between October 18, 2021 and October 21, 2021, members of Monmouth’s management and its financial advisors
participated in further due diligence sessions with representatives of ILPT, Bidder 1, and Bidder 2.
On October 22, 2021, representatives of Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP (“Hunton”), ILPT’s legal advisor, submitted a
revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. Bidder 1 and Bidder 2 did not submit
markups of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton in advance of the final bid deadline.
On October 27, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided feedback to Hunton regarding its revised draft of
the merger agreement, including feedback regarding closing conditionality and the termination fee payable by
Monmouth under the merger agreement under certain circumstances.
On October 29, 2021, representatives of Bidder 1 called representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA and indicated that
Bidder 1 would not be able to increase its previous offer and did not intend to submit a revised proposal at the final
bid deadline.
Also on October 29, 2021, representatives of Bidder 2 contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to indicate that,
following its evaluation of Monmouth’s projected growth profile, Bidder 2 would not be able to increase its previous
offer and did not intend to submit a revised proposal at the final bid deadline.
On November 1, 2021, ILPT submitted its “best and final” all-cash offer of $21.00 per share. ILPT’s offer provided for
Monmouth’s ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends of up to $0.18 per share for each completed quarter until
the completion of the transaction, no financing contingency, and the expectation that Messrs. Eugene Landy and
Michael Landy would enter into customary voting agreements to support the transaction. ILPT also indicated that no
further diligence was required and it was prepared to finalize and execute the transaction documentation in short
order.
On November 2, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth’s board of directors was held to discuss the final offer received
from ILPT, attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, CSCA, and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of J.P. Morgan
and CSCA advised Monmouth’s board of directors of the progress of the strategic alternatives process to date,
including ILPT’s proposal, and presented certain preliminary financial analyses
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
regarding ILPT’s proposal and the withdrawal of each of Bidder 1 and Bidder 2. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton
reviewed with the board of directors the terms proposed by ILPT, as well as open issues and remaining areas of
negotiation. Members of Monmouth’s board of directors noted the compelling value that ILPT’s offer represented.
Following that discussion, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously authorized Monmouth and its advisors to
negotiate with ILPT to seek to finalize definitive documentation for the transaction.
Later on November 2, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan and CSCA, acting at the direction of Monmouth’s board of
directors, called Mr. Adam Portnoy, ILPT’s Managing Trustee, and representatives of Citigroup, ILPT’s financial
advisor, to inform them of Monmouth’s willingness to negotiate definitive documentation for the transaction with
ILPT, subject to agreement on certain terms, including a reduced termination fee, reduced expense reimbursement
obligation of Monmouth, and shorter duration for ILPT’s right to delay the closing under certain circumstances. ILPT
and its representatives indicated that ILPT was prepared to agree to a transaction that reflected the terms proposed
by representatives of Monmouth.
On November 3, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent to representatives of Hunton a markup of the merger
agreement and Monmouth’s disclosure letter to the merger agreement. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton
and of Hunton provided to each other successive markups of the merger agreement and Monmouth’s disclosure
letter, until such documents were finalized.
Also on November 3, 2021, representatives of Hunton sent to representatives of Wachtell Lipton a draft form of
voting agreement for Messrs. Eugene Landy and Michael Landy. Thereafter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and
of Hunton provided to each other successive markups of the form of voting agreement until it was finalized.
On November 4, 2021, a special meeting of Monmouth’s board of directors was convened to consider approval of the
merger agreement with ILPT. In addition to members of Monmouth’s management, in attendance at the meeting were
representatives of J.P. Morgan, CSCA and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with
Monmouth’s board of directors the key terms of the proposed final merger agreement. Representatives of J.P. Morgan
and CSCA then reviewed their financial analyses of the consideration provided for in the merger agreement.
Following their presentation, representatives of J.P. Morgan delivered to Monmouth’s board of directors J.P.
Morgan’s oral opinion, confirmed the following day by delivery of a written opinion dated November 4, 2021, to the
effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be
paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Monmouth’s
common shareholders, as more fully described below in the section “The Merger-Opinions of Monmouth’s Financial
Advisors.” Following their presentation, representatives of CSCA delivered to Monmouth’s board of directors
CSCA’s oral opinion, confirmed later that day by delivery of a written opinion dated November 4, 2021, to the effect
that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken by CSCA in preparing its opinion, that the consideration to be received by
Monmouth’s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Monmouth’s common
shareholders. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton also reviewed the directors’ duties in connection with their
consideration and evaluation of the potential transaction. Following discussion, Monmouth’s board of directors
unanimously adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and related matters.
Also on November 4, 2021, Monmouth, with the approval of its board of directors, entered into an agreement with
Blackwells pursuant to which Blackwells would withdraw its proposals, support the proposed transaction and enter
into various standstill, solicitation and support arrangements. Monmouth simultaneously entered into an agreement
with its former general counsel and Blackwells to settle and dismiss all claims between them in the New Jersey
litigation.
On the morning of November 5, 2021, prior to market open, Monmouth and ILPT executed the Merger Agreement and
each issued a press release announcing entry into the Merger.

In evaluating the Merger, Monmouth’s board of directors consulted with Monmouth’s management and its legal and
financial advisors and, after careful consideration, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously determined and
declared that the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the
32TABLE OF CONTENTS
Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Monmouth and its shareholders, approved, adopted,
and authorized in all respects the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, and authorized the execution and delivery by Monmouth of the Merger Agreement. In
determining and declaring that the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Monmouth and its shareholders, in approving, adopting,
and authorizing the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, in authorizing the execution and delivery by Monmouth of the Merger Agreement, and in recommending
that Monmouth shareholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, Monmouth’s board of directors considered various factors that it viewed as
supporting its decisions, including the following material factors:
•
the Merger Consideration of $21.00 per share represents a 24% premium to the unaffected closing share
price of Monmouth Common Stock of $16.99 on December 18, 2020, the last trading day prior to news
reports that Blackwells had offered to acquire Monmouth for $18.00 per share in cash, and a 36% premium
to the 30-day volume weighted average unaffected trading share price of $15.43;
•
the Merger Consideration is higher than the all-time highest reported sales price of Monmouth Common
Stock;
•
the Merger Agreement permits Monmouth to continue to pay Monmouth’s common shareholders regular
quarterly cash dividends of up to $0.18 per share for each completed quarter until the consummation of the
Merger;
•
the Merger Consideration is all cash, and the Merger provides certain and immediate value and liquidity to
Monmouth’s shareholders for their shares, especially when viewed against any risks and uncertainties
associated with Monmouth’s standalone strategy;
•
the financial analyses presented to Monmouth’s board of directors by each of J.P. Morgan and CSCA and
the November 4, 2021 oral opinions delivered by J.P. Morgan and CSCA to Monmouth’s board of directors,
which were confirmed by delivery of written opinions dated November 4, 2021, to the effect that, as of such
date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan and CSCA in preparing their respective opinions, in the
case of J.P. Morgan, the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, and, in the case of CSCA, the
consideration to be received by the holders of Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a
financial point of view, in each case as more fully described below in the section entitled “The Merger-
Opinions of Monmouth’s Financial Advisors.” The full text of the written opinions of J.P. Morgan and
CSCA, each dated November 4, 2021, which set forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan and
CSCA in preparing their respective opinions, are attached as Annex B and Annex C to this proxy statement
and are incorporated herein by reference.
•
the robust pre-signing strategic alternatives sale process conducted by J.P. Morgan and CSCA at the
direction and under the supervision of Monmouth’s board of directors, which involved outreach to
approximately ninety potential interested parties and an agreed and publicly disclosed transaction
agreement during the initial strategic review process, and outreach to more than twenty qualified potential
interested parties during the renewed strategic alternative review process, in both cases including financial
sponsors, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, real estate managers and
other financial and strategic investors, and the receipt of first round indications of interest from three
potential counterparties, and a “best and final” proposal from ILPT;

the initial strategic alternatives process that led to the now-terminated transaction with EQC had resulted in
a transaction with significant disclosure and a publicly disclosed competing proposal, and such initial
process, combined with Monmouth’s renewed strategic alternatives process and the public announcement
of the renewed process, put potential acquirers on notice of Monmouth’s willingness to engage in
discussions for a strategic sale;

Monmouth’s board of directors also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors in

including the following material factors:
•
that, following the Merger, Monmouth would no longer exist as a stand-alone public company and
Monmouth’s shareholders would not participate in any future growth Monmouth might have achieved on a
stand-alone basis or the combined company might achieve;
•
the risk that an alternative transaction or different strategic alternative potentially could be more beneficial
to Monmouth’s shareholders than the proposed merger with ILPT;
•
that, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Monmouth must pay ILPT a $72 million termination fee if

consummated under certain circumstances following termination of the Merger Agreement, which might
discourage or deter other parties from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous

the risk of diverting management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic
opportunities while working to implement the Merger and the risk that if the Merger is not completed,

•
the expenses to be incurred in connection with the Merger;

Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and

rights in connection with the Merger.
This discussion of the foregoing information and material factors considered by Monmouth’s board of directors in
reaching its conclusions and recommendations is not intended to be exhaustive and is not provided in any specific
order or ranking. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by Monmouth’s board of directors in evaluating
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, and the complexity of these matters, Monmouth’s
board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank, or otherwise assign relative
weight to those factors. In addition, different members of Monmouth’s board of directors may have given different
weight to different factors. Monmouth’s board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any
of the factors considered and instead conducted an overall review of such factors and determined that, in the
aggregate, the potential benefits considered outweighed the potential risks or possible negative consequences of
approving the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
This explanation of the reasoning of Monmouth’s board of directors and all other information presented in this
section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section
entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
After careful consideration, for the reasons set forth above, Monmouth’s board of directors unanimously
recommends that Monmouth’s shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Compensation Proposal,
and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

Opinion of J.P. Morgan
Pursuant to an engagement letter, Monmouth retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
Merger.
At the meeting of Monmouth’s board of directors on November 4, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to
Monmouth’s board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its
opinion, the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such shareholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its November 4, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its
written opinion to Monmouth’s board of directors, dated November 4, 2021, that, as of such date, the consideration
to be paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
shareholders.
35TABLE OF CONTENTS
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated November 4, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan
in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The
summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of such opinion. Monmouth’s common shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P.
Morgan’s opinion was addressed to Monmouth’s board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and
for the purposes of its evaluation of the Merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s
common shareholders in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no
opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Monmouth or as to the underlying decision by Monmouth to
engage in the Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan.
The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Monmouth as to how such shareholder
should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft dated November 3, 2021 of the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning Monmouth and the
industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of Monmouth with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of shares of Monmouth Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other
companies;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management
of Monmouth relating to its business, as discussed more fully under “The Merger-Summary of Certain
Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of Monmouth with respect to
certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of Monmouth, the financial condition
and future prospects and operations of Monmouth, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or
appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by Monmouth or otherwise reviewed by or for
J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and,
pursuant to J.P. Morgan’s engagement letter with Monmouth, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to
undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was not provided with any valuation or
appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of Monmouth or ILPT under any state
or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts
provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on
assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by Monmouth’s management as to the
expected future results of operations and financial condition of Monmouth to which such analyses or forecasts
relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based.
J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement would
be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and
warranties made by Monmouth, ILPT and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and
would be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and
has relied on the assessments made by
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
advisors to Monmouth with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental,
regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be obtained
without any adverse effect on Monmouth or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
The projections furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by Monmouth’s management, as discussed more fully under
“The Merger-Summary of Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.”. Monmouth does not
routinely publicly disclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with
J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure.
These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be
beyond the control of Monmouth’s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic
and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from
those set forth in such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other forward-looking
statements, please refer to the section of the proxy statement entitled “The Merger-Summary of Certain Monmouth
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.”
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that
subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
to Monmouth’s common shareholders, of the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders in the
Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection
with the Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Monmouth or as
to the underlying decision by Monmouth to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion
with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the
Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders in
the Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the
price at which shares of Monmouth Common Stock will trade at any future time.
The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders,
were determined through arm’s length negotiations between Monmouth and ILPT, and the decision to enter into the
Merger Agreement was solely that of Monmouth’s board of directors. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses
were only one of the many factors considered by Monmouth’s board of directors in its evaluation of the Merger and
should not be viewed as determinative of the views of Monmouth’s board of directors or Monmouth’s management
with respect to the Merger or the consideration to be paid to Monmouth’s common shareholders.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodologies in rendering its opinion to Monmouth’s board of directors on November 4, 2021 and in the financial
analysis presented to Monmouth’s board of directors on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its
opinion to Monmouth’s board of directors and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used
by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth
below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of
Monmouth with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged
to be sufficiently analogous to those engaged in by Monmouth. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as
follows:
•
STAG Industrial, Inc.
•
Lexington Realty Trust
•
Monmouth
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations
and businesses that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of Monmouth.
However, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of Monmouth.
The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies
differently than they would affect Monmouth.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratios of (a) the
company’s price per common share to the consensus equity research analyst estimates for the company’s adjusted
funds from operations (“AFFO”) per common share for the year ending December 31, 2022 (the “P/2022E AFFO”), (b)
the company’s price per common share to the consensus equity research analyst estimates for the company’s funds
from operations (“FFO”) per common share for the year ending December 31, 2022 (the “P/2022E FFO”), and (c)
consensus equity research analyst estimates for the company’s in-place cash net operating income for the year
ending December 31, 2022 to consensus equity research analyst estimates for the company’s implied real estate value
(the “Implied Capitalization Rate”).
Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected multiple reference ranges of 21.00x - 22.50x, 19.50x - 21.00x
and 4.7% - 4.9% for P/2022E AFFO, P/2022E FFO and the Implied Capitalization Rate, respectively. After applying
such ranges to the projected AFFO for Monmouth for the year ending December 31, 2022, the projected FFO for
Monmouth for the year ending December 31, 2022 and the projected in-place cash net operating income for
Monmouth for the year ending December 31, 2022, respectively, the analysis indicated the following ranges of implied
per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for shares of Monmouth Common Stock:
Implied Per Share Equity
Value
Low
High
Monmouth P/2022E AFFO
$18.75
$20.00
Monmouth P/2022E FFO
$18.00
$19.50
Monmouth Implied Capitalization Rate
$19.00
$20.50
The ranges of implied per share equity value for Monmouth Common Stock were compared to (i) the 30-day
unaffected volume-weighted average price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $15.43 as of the Unaffected
Date, (ii) the closing price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $19.01 as of November 3, 2021, the trading day
immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion dated November 4, 2021, and (iii) the Merger
Consideration of $21.00 per share.
Selected Transaction Multiples Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined the May 2018
acquisition (the “Gramercy Acquisition”) by The Blackstone Group LP (“Blackstone”) of Gramercy Property Trust
(“Gramercy”), a target company engaged in a business which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the
business of Monmouth or aspects thereof. Neither Blackstone nor Gramercy is identical to ILPT or Monmouth and
the Gramercy Acquisition is not identical to the Merger. However, the Gramercy Acquisition was selected, among
other reasons, since Gramercy, for purpose of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, shares similar business characteristics with
Monmouth based on business sector participation, operational characteristics, and financial metrics. This analysis
necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational
characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the Gramercy Acquisition as compared
to the Merger.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio of Gramercy’s in-place cash net operating
income for the forward twelve month period to the implied real estate value of the Gramercy Acquisition based on
company filings, information obtained from FactSet Research Systems and public news sources, indicating an Implied
Capitalization Rate of 6.1%. After applying such rate to Monmouth’s forward cash net operating income, inclusive of
estimated income from in-contract acquisitions and currently in-progress expansion projects, this analysis indicated
an implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of $12.00 for Monmouth Common Stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The estimate of implied per share equity value for Monmouth Common Stock was compared to (i) the 30-day
unaffected volume-weighted average price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $15.43 as of the Unaffected
Date, (ii) the closing price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $19.01 as of November 3, 2021, the trading day
immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion dated November 4, 2021, and (iii) the Merger
Consideration of $21.00 per share.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of
determining an implied fully diluted equity value per share for Monmouth Common Stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the
unlevered free cash flows that Monmouth is expected to generate during calendar years 2021E through 2026E based
upon the financial projections prepared by Monmouth’s management (as set forth below in the section entitled “The
Merger-Summary of Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, which was discussed with,
and approved by, Monmouth’s board of directors for use by J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses).
J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for Monmouth at the end of this period by applying perpetual
growth rates ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%, based on guidance provided by Monmouth’s management, to estimates of
the net operating income for Monmouth at the end of fiscal-year 2026E, as provided in the Monmouth management
projections. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values to
present value as of September 30, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 6.50% to 7.00% for Monmouth, which
ranges were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Monmouth.
The present value of the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by
subtracting net debt and other adjustments for Monmouth as of September 30, 2021.
Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated the following ranges of implied per share equity value (rounded to the
nearest $0.25) for Monmouth Common Stock:
Implied Per Share Equity
Value
Low
High
Monmouth Discounted Cash Flow
$11.00
$18.25
The range of implied per share equity values for Monmouth Common Stock was compared to (i) the 30-day
unaffected volume-weighted average price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $15.43 as of the Unaffected
Date, (ii) the closing price of a share of Monmouth Common Stock of $19.01 as of November 3, 2021, the trading day
immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s written opinion dated November 4, 2021, and (iii) the Merger
Consideration of $21.00 per share.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the
foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of
the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for
analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of
Monmouth. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those
analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses
or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or
negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the
totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.
Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected
companies reviewed as described in the above summary are identical to Monmouth, and the Gramercy Acquisition,
the selected transaction reviewed as described in the above summary, was not identical to the Merger. However, the
companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of
Monmouth. The Gramercy Acquisition was similarly chosen because its participants, size and other factors, for
purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger. The analyses necessarily involve
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the
companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to Monmouth and the Gramercy
Acquisition compared to the Merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise Monmouth with respect to the
Merger and deliver an opinion to Monmouth’s board of directors with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among
other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity
with Monmouth and the industries in which it operates.
For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger, Monmouth has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an
estimated fee of approximately $17 million, $4.5 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan when J.P. Morgan
delivered prior opinions in connection with the now-terminated transaction with EQC to Monmouth’s board of
directors, $1.5 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion to
Monmouth’s board of directors on November 4, 2021 and the remainder of which is contingent and payable upon the
consummation of the Merger. In addition, Monmouth has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for certain of its expenses
incurred in connection with its services, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and will indemnify
J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement. During the two years preceding the
date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or
other material commercial or investment banking relationships with Monmouth (except for acting as joint lead
arranger and joint lead bookrunner on a Monmouth credit facility in November 2019), or any material financial
advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with ILPT or The RMR Group LLC
(“RMR”), ILPT’s business manager. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than
1% of the outstanding common shares of each of Monmouth and ILPT. In the ordinary course of their businesses,
J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Monmouth or ILPT for their own accounts or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial
instruments. During the two year period preceding the date of its opinion ending on November 4, 2021, the aggregate
fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Monmouth were approximately $5 million and from ILPT and RMR were less
than $50,000.
Opinion of CSCA
CSCA was engaged by Monmouth to serve as a financial advisor in connection with the Merger. On November 4,
2021, CSCA rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of CSCA’s written
opinion dated November 4, 2021) to Monmouth’s board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject
to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by
the holders of Monmouth Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to Monmouth’s common
shareholders.
The full text of CSCA’s written opinion, dated as of November 4, 2021, is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement. CSCA’s written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,
factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by CSCA in rendering its opinion. You are
encouraged to read CSCA’s opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of CSCA’s opinion and the
methodology that CSCA used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of CSCA’s opinion.
CSCA’s opinion, the issuance of which was approved by CSCA’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its
policies and procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, is addressed to Monmouth’s board of directors and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In arriving at its opinion, CSCA reviewed and considered such financial and other matters as CSCA deemed relevant
and appropriate under the circumstances. CSCA’s procedures, investigations, and financial analysis with respect to
the preparation of its opinion included, among other things, the following:
•
Reviewed Monmouth’s (i) audited financial information for the twelve-month periods ended September 30,
2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, (ii) draft unaudited financial information for the three-month and twelve-
month periods ended September 30, 2021, and (iii) projected financial information relating to the business,
earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and capitalization, including certain internal analyses and forecasts
prepared by the management of Monmouth as discussed more fully under “The Merger-Summary of
Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” All of the foregoing information was
prepared and provided to CSCA by Monmouth management;
•
Reviewed certain publicly available audited and unaudited financial statements and other publicly available
business, financial and other information of Monmouth including but not limited to the Annual Report filed
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and related supplementary financial information
thereto, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and related supplementary information for each of the fiscal
quarters ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020;
•
Reviewed drafts of the Merger Agreement, the most recent draft dated November 4, 2021, and the
disclosure schedules thereto;
•
Compared certain publicly available financial information of Monmouth with similar publicly available
information of other comparable publicly traded industrial and net lease REITs, as CSCA deemed relevant to
its analyses;
•
Reviewed the terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable transactions, and compared such
terms to the terms of the Merger, as CSCA deemed relevant to its analysis;
•
Reviewed the stock price history of Monmouth and compared such prices to the terms of the Merger, as
CSCA deemed relevant to its analysis;
•
Performed various financial analyses as CSCA deemed appropriate, using generally accepted analytical
valuation methodologies; and
•
Performed such other analyses, inquiries and investigations and consideration of such other factors as
CSCA deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion, including its knowledge of REITs, the industrial
real estate sector, as well as its experience in connection with similar transactions and securities valuation
generally.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, CSCA assumed, without independently verifying or confirming, at the
direction of Monmouth, that the terms of the Merger will conform in all material respects with those set forth in the
Merger Agreement and the disclosure schedules thereto. CSCA also assumed that the Merger Agreement and any
disclosure schedules thereto provided to it in draft form would ultimately be executed in final form consistent in all
material respects with the most recent drafts provided and that the Merger and all related transactions described in or
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the disclosure schedules thereto occur in all material respects as
described in and contemplated by such documents. CSCA also assumed in all respects material to its analyses that
the representations and warranties of the parties to any agreement entered into in connection with the Merger would
be true and correct, that the parties to such agreements would perform all of the covenants and agreements required
to be performed by it under such agreements, and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger would be
satisfied without any material modification or waiver thereof. CSCA also assumed that all governmental, regulatory
and other consents and approvals contemplated by the Merger would be obtained and that in the course of
obtaining any of those consents, no restrictions or conditions (including any divestiture requirements) would be
imposed or waivers made that would have an adverse effect on any of Monmouth, Merger Sub, or ILPT or the
contemplated Merger, except as provided in the Merger Agreement or the disclosure schedules thereto.
For purposes of its opinion, CSCA, with Monmouth’s board of directors’ consent, assumed and relied upon, without
independent verification, and was advised by management of Monmouth as to, the accuracy and
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
completeness of all projections provided by management of Monmouth and all financial and other information
publicly available to, furnished to, or otherwise made available to or discussed with CSCA including, without
limitation, the items listed above as reviewed by and/or discussed with CSCA and the financial statements and
forecasts as provided by management of Monmouth. With respect to financial information, at Monmouth’s direction,
CSCA assumed without independent verification that (i) such financial information, projections and other information
were reasonably prepared on a basis that reflected the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of
the management of Monmouth, (ii) such financial information and projections were a reasonable basis to evaluate
Monmouth, and at the direction of Monmouth, CSCA relied upon such financial information and projections for
purposes of its analyses and its opinion and (iii) there had been no material adverse change in the assets, financial
condition, business or prospects of Monmouth. CSCA assumed no responsibility for and expressed no opinion as to
the forecasts or the assumptions on which they were made. CSCA also assumed that as to all legal matters pertaining
to Monmouth, Monmouth had been appropriately advised by Monmouth’s legal counsel.
CSCA was not engaged to, and therefore did not, independently verify the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided to CSCA, nor did it express any opinion with respect thereto. CSCA relied upon the assurances
of the management of Monmouth that management is not aware of any information or facts that would make the
information provided or otherwise made available to CSCA incomplete, materially inaccurate, or misleading. CSCA did
not perform any independent evaluation, valuation, audit or appraisal of assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise,
including contractual rights or obligations), or physical inspection of any assets, of Monmouth, and CSCA did not
attempt to assess or value any of the intangible assets of Monmouth; nor did CSCA obtain nor was CSCA furnished
with any such valuations, audits or appraisals. In addition, CSCA did not evaluate, or obtain the evaluations of, the
solvency or fair value of Monmouth under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar
matters. CSCA expressed no opinion as to the prices at which shares of Monmouth Common Stock would trade
following the announcement of the Merger.
For the purposes of its analyses and review, CSCA made numerous assumptions based on its judgment and
experience and without seeking independent verification with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, any of which are beyond the control of Monmouth or
any other parties to the Merger Agreement. The analyses performed by CSCA are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.
CSCA did not express any opinion with respect to any alternatives to the Merger or other strategic alternatives that
may be available to Monmouth or otherwise. CSCA’s opinion also did not address the merits of the underlying
decision by Monmouth to engage in the Merger or the manner in which to effect the Merger or the relative merits of
its decision not to proceed with any alternative strategies or transactions that may be available to Monmouth.
Further, CSCA was not engaged to, and did not, independently assess or consider, and its opinion does not address,
any tax, regulatory, legal, and accounting matters relating to the Merger Agreement and the disclosure schedules
thereto, the Merger, or the consequences of the Merger on Monmouth, or any shareholder of Monmouth.
CSCA’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Monmouth
Common Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock in
the Merger and no opinion or view was expressed by CSCA with respect to any consideration received in connection
with the Merger by the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In
addition, no opinion or view was expressed by CSCA with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the
amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officer, director, or employee of any party to the
Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Monmouth
Common Stock.
CSCA’s opinion was necessarily based on CSCA’s assessment of economic, market, financial, regulatory and other
conditions and circumstances as they existed as the date of its opinion, November 4, 2021, and which could be
evaluated, and the information made available to CSCA, on and as of the date of the opinion. CSCA does not have
any obligation and accepted no responsibility to update, revise, or reaffirm its opinion for subsequent developments
which may affect its opinion and it expressly disclaimed any responsibility to do so. CSCA is not required to update
its opinion as a consequence of any changes in projections, financial information, Monmouth’s performance, or other
circumstances.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In arriving at its opinion, CSCA did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by
it but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all
other analyses performed and factors considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular
transaction. Accordingly, CSCA believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion
of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.
Summary of Material Financial Analyses. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
CSCA in preparing its opinion to Monmouth’s board of directors. The summary of CSCA’s analyses and reviews
provided below is not a complete description of the analyses and reviews underlying its opinion.
For the purposes of its analyses and review, CSCA made numerous assumptions based on various quantitative and
qualitative judgments and determinations, and without seeking independent verification, with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Monmouth or any other parties to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and the adaptation and application of these methods to the unique facts and circumstances
presented. No company, business, or transaction considered in CSCA’s analyses and review is identical to
Monmouth or the Merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading, or other values of the companies,
businesses, or transactions considered in CSCA’s analyses and reviews. None of Monmouth, CSCA, or any other
person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained
in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of companies, businesses or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the companies, businesses, or securities may
actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, CSCA’s analyses and reviews are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The summary of the financial analyses and reviews summarized below include information presented in tabular
format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. In order to fully understand the
financial analyses and reviews used by CSCA, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in
the tables below without considering the full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies
and assumptions underlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of CSCA’s
analyses and reviews. Accordingly, CSCA believes that its analyses and the following summary must be considered
as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, methodologies and factors, without considering all analyses,
methodologies and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying CSCA’s
analyses and opinion.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by CSCA in connection with the preparation
of its opinion and reviewed with Monmouth’s board of directors on November 4, 2021. The order of the analyses
does not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by CSCA.
For the purposes of each of the following analyses, CSCA compared the results of each analysis to the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger.
Selected Comparable Companies Analysis. CSCA performed a selected comparable companies analysis with respect
to Monmouth in which CSCA reviewed and compared financial and operating data relating to Monmouth and the
selected publicly-traded companies listed below.
In performing the selected comparable companies analysis with respect to Monmouth, CSCA reviewed financial and
operating data for publicly-traded, internally-managed REITs with significant concentrations of single-tenant
industrial properties that CSCA, based on its experience in the REIT industry, deemed comparable to Monmouth (the
“Industrial Peer Group”).
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The selected comparable companies with respect to Monmouth were:
•
W.P. Carey Inc.;
•
STAG Industrial, Inc.;
•
Lexington Realty Trust; and
•
Broadstone Net Lease, Inc.
CSCA calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios for Monmouth and the Industrial Peer Group.
CSCA noted that while the selected comparable companies included in the Industrial Peer Group shared similar
attributes, none were directly comparable to Monmouth, and other companies might be considered as comparable
that are not set forth in the discussion that follows.
As part of its selected comparable company analysis, CSCA calculated and analyzed for each applicable company: (i)
the implied cash capitalization rate for the Industrial Peer Group (“Implied Cash Capitalization Rate”) utilizing cash net
operating income (“NOI”) as reported by the Industrial Peer Group; (ii) the ratio of its price per share as of November
3, 2021 to its calendar year 2022 estimated FFO per share based on consensus analyst estimates available to CSCA
(“Price / CY 2022E FFO”); (iii) the ratio of its price per share as of November 3, 2021 to its calendar year 2022 estimated
AFFO per share based on consensus analyst estimates available to CSCA (“Price / CY 2022E AFFO”); and (iv) the
implied applicable premium or discount to NAV based on consensus analyst estimates available to CSCA
(“Prem/(Disc.) to NAV”).

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. CSCA reviewed and compared the purchase prices and financial multiples
paid in selected other transactions that CSCA, based on its experience with merger and acquisition transactions,
deemed relevant. CSCA chose such transactions with a focus on U.S. target companies based on, among other
things, the similarity of the applicable target companies in the transactions to Monmouth including, but not limited
to, concentrations of single-tenant industrial or other analogous assets. CSCA reviewed the following transactions:

The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were
diverse and there are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of each of
Monmouth and the companies included in the selected precedent transaction analysis. CSCA noted that based on
certain attributes, including the ownership of single-tenant assets and certain similar operating markets, Industrial
Income Trust Inc. (“IIT”) and WPT Industrial REIT (“WPT”) may be considered comparable to Monmouth, whereas
based on certain other attributes including, but not limited to, the ownership of multi-tenant assets and in-house
development functions, IIT and WPT may not be considered comparable to Monmouth. Although none of the
selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger and while there may be other precedent transactions that
may be considered comparable, the target companies in the selected transactions were companies that, for purposes
of analysis, may be considered similar to Monmouth.
Accordingly, for the above selected transactions, based on information from public filings and FactSet that CSCA, in
its judgment, determined were relevant, CSCA calculated and reviewed the implied cash capitalization rates paid in
such transactions. The following table sets forth the results of such analysis:

information provided by Monmouth management. The following table sets forth the results of such analyses.

Capitalization Rate Valuation Analysis. In performing the capitalization rate valuation analysis with respect to
Monmouth, CSCA utilized a range of property-level cash capitalization rates selected by CSCA and informed from a
variety of sources including, but not limited to, the Industrial Peer Group, precedent transactions and industry
research, among other sources. An estimated range of real estate values was calculated by applying a range of cash
capitalization rates from 4.50% to 5.25% to Monmouth’s pro forma cash NOI, as provided by

For each of the transactions, CSCA reviewed, among other things, the ratio of the target company’s share premium or
discount to the closing stock price as of (i) one day, (ii) five days, (iii) two weeks, and (iv) 30 days prior to the date
each transaction was announced or a news report, management commentary, public filing, or other public disclosure
regarding such transaction occurred.
CSCA then calculated the 25th percentile, median, mean, and 75th percentile of the premiums paid for each respective
time period.
CSCA then applied the range of premiums/discounts of the comparable transactions to the closing stock price of a
share of Monmouth Common Stock through the Unaffected Date. The following table sets forth the results of such
analyses.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. CSCA performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to Monmouth by
calculating the estimated present value as of September 30, 2021 of (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for
Monmouth from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2026, as reflected in Monmouth management forecasts
described under “The Merger-Summary of Certain Monmouth Unaudited Prospective Financial Information-
Monmouth Multi-Year Projected Cash Flows” and (ii) a range of terminal values of Monmouth based on annualized
EBITDA excluding dividend and interest income and straight-line rent as of December 2026, all of which were
discussed with, and approved by, Monmouth for use by CSCA in its analysis. For purposes of its analysis, CSCA
utilized a range of discount rates from 6.00% to 6.50%, which CSCA derived utilizing the capital asset pricing model
which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Monmouth’s capital structure weightings, the cost of long-
term debt, and a beta for Monmouth, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets
generally. The estimated terminal value of Monmouth was calculated by applying a selected range of EBITDA
multiples of 20.0x to 23.0x, selected by CSCA based in part on the historical EBITDA trading multiples of the
Industrial Peer Group and in part on CSCA’s professional judgment.

CSCA derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Monmouth by adding the ranges of present values it
derived as described above. The range of resulting enterprise values CSCA derived for Monmouth were then
adjusted for balance sheet items, including subtracting net debt (defined as debt less cash), adding securities
holdings and subtracting preferred equity, to calculate implied equity values per share. The following table sets forth
the results of such analyses.

Other Factors. CSCA also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial
analyses in connection with rendering its advice, but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among
other things, the Historical Trading Analysis described below.
Historical Trading Analysis. CSCA reviewed historical trading prices of a share of Monmouth Common Stock for the
52-week period ended as of the Unaffected Date, noting the range of low to high closing prices of $8.97 to $17.10.
CSCA also noted that over the 12-month and 6-month periods up to the Unaffected Date, shares of Monmouth
Common Stock traded at volume weighted average prices of $13.81 and $14.59, respectively. CSCA further noted that
following the Unaffected Date, through November 3, 2021, shares of Monmouth Common Stock traded within a range
of low to high closing prices of $16.23 to $19.65.
General. The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Monmouth and
ILPT and was approved by Monmouth’s board of directors. CSCA provided advice to Monmouth during these
negotiations. CSCA did not, however, recommend any specific merger consideration to Monmouth or its board of
directors or that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described above, CSCA’s opinion to Monmouth’s board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by Monmouth’s board of directors in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement.
CSCA is a recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged
in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for
passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes from which conflicting
interest or duties, or a perception thereof, may arise. CSCA was selected to advise Monmouth with respect to the
Merger and deliver an opinion to Monmouth’s board of directors with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among
other things, CSCA’s substantial experience in the REIT industry and Monmouth’s long-standing relationship with
CSCA.
CSCA is acting as non-exclusive financial advisor to Monmouth in connection with the Merger and will receive a
non-contingent fee from Monmouth for its services of $1.0 million which became payable upon the delivery of
CSCA’s opinion (in addition to the $2.0 million of fees paid to CSCA for the delivery of CSCA’s prior opinions in
connection with the now-terminated transaction with EQC). In addition, Monmouth has agreed to reimburse CSCA
for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and indemnify CSCA for certain liabilities that may arise out of its
engagement by Monmouth and the rendering of CSCA’s opinion. Pursuant to the terms of the engagement, CSCA
may be paid additional fees at CSCA’s standard hourly rates for any time incurred should CSCA be called upon to
support its findings or provide further services related to its opinion subsequent to the delivery of its opinion. CSCA
will also receive a success fee, which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, equal to 0.70% of the
transaction value, which is estimated to be approximately $14.5 million. The prior opinion fees paid to CSCA will be
fully credited against the success fee, and the opinion fee with respect to this transaction will be 50% credited
against the success fee. Pursuant to a separate advisory agreement with

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Monmouth dated December 8, 2020, CSCA has received and will receive quarterly advisory fees from Monmouth until
such agreement is terminated. In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, CSCA has provided certain financial
advisory services for Monmouth, having received approximately $2.2 million for such services. In the two years
preceding the date of its opinion, CSCA has not provided any investment banking or advisory services to ILPT or
RMR. CSCA may in the future provide investment banking and advisory services to ILPT or RMR for which it may
receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.",43,58

While Monmouth has from time to time provided limited guidance to investors in its regular earnings press releases
and other investor materials with respect to certain financial results and operational metrics for the then-current fiscal
year, Monmouth has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed internal projections as to future
performance, earnings or results of operations due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and
subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the evaluation of the now-
terminated transaction with EQC, prior to the execution of the merger agreement for such transaction, Monmouth
management prepared and provided to Monmouth’s board of directors, and to Monmouth’s financial advisors, J.P.
Morgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and opinions in
connection with the now-terminated transaction with EQC, certain nonpublic, internal financial projections regarding
Monmouth’s future operations for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2021, September 30, 2022, September 30,
2023, September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2025, and for the calendar years ending December 31, 2021, December 31,
2022, December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025 (the “prior Monmouth multi-year projected
financial information”). In connection with the evaluation of the Merger, prior to the execution of the Merger
Agreement, Monmouth management extended the prior Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to the
fiscal year ending September 30, 2026 and the calendar year ending December 31, 2026 and revised the projected
financial information to reflect certain updated assumptions for such financial projections as a result of the passage
of time since the preparation of the prior Monmouth multi-year projected financial information, including a delay in
the pace of acquisitions, reduced capitalization rates on acquisitions, reduced financing costs, and elimination of new
preferred equity issuance (such extended and updated projections, the “Monmouth multi-year projected financial
information”) and provided the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to Monmouth’s board of
directors and to J.P. Morgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial
analyses and opinions in connection with the Merger. As described below, the Monmouth multi-year projected
financial information was also made available to ILPT and its financial advisor, as well as certain other prospective
counterparties who entered into a non-disclosure agreement as part of the process. For more information, see the
section entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Monmouth’s Financial Advisors.” Monmouth has included below a
summary of the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information for the purpose of providing shareholders and
investors access to certain nonpublic information that was furnished to J.P. Morgan, CSCA and Monmouth’s board
of directors in connection with the Merger. Such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not
included to influence your voting decision with respect to the proposals set forth in this proxy statement to be voted
on by Monmouth shareholders. The inclusion of this summary should not be regarded as an indication that
Monmouth management or anyone who received the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information then
considered, or now considers, it to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the Monmouth multi-year projected
financial information should not be relied upon as such. This information is not fact and readers of this proxy
statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information.
The Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, and
does not necessarily comply with published guidelines established by the SEC or by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentations of financial projections, but in the view of Monmouth
management, was prepared on a reasonable basis and reflects the assumptions and estimates available at the time the
Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was prepared. The Monmouth multi-year projected financial
information involves significant estimates and assumptions that make it inherently less comparable to the similarly
titled GAAP measures in Monmouth’s historical GAAP financial statements. The Monmouth multi-year projected
financial information included in this section of the proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility
of, Monmouth management. Neither PKF O’Connor Davies, LLP (“PKF”), Monmouth’s independent registered public
accounting firm, nor any other independent accountant has examined, compiled or performed any procedures with
respect to the Monmouth multi-year

projected financial information or any assumptions underlying the Monmouth multi-year projected financial
information and, accordingly, PKF does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the Monmouth
multi-year projected financial information or its achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any
association with respect to, the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or the assumptions underlying
the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information. The report of PKF contained in Monmouth’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement, relates to Monmouth’s historical financial information and does not extend to the Monmouth multi-year
projected financial information or any other prospective financial information. Furthermore, the Monmouth multi-year
projected financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was
prepared.
While presented with numeric specificity, the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was based on
numerous variables and assumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance and general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Monmouth’s business) that are
inherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of Monmouth management. Important factors that
may affect actual results and cause the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to not be achieved
include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Monmouth’s business (including Monmouth’s
ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general
business, economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and other factors described in the
sections of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and the
risks described in the periodic reports filed by Monmouth with the SEC, which reports can be found as described
under “Where You Can Find More Information.” The Monmouth multi-year projected financial information also
reflects numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time the Monmouth multi-year projected
financial information was prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual
results may differ materially from those contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized. Monmouth
shareholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of Monmouth for a description of the reported and
anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources, including in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Monmouth’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
The inclusion of a summary of the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information in this proxy statement
should not be regarded as an indication that Monmouth or its officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other
representatives considered the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information to necessarily be predictive of
actual future events, and the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information should not be relied upon as such
nor should the information contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information be considered
appropriate for other purposes. None of Monmouth or its officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other
representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Monmouth multi-
year projected financial information.
MONMOUTH DOES NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE OR RECONCILE THE MONMOUTH
MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE
DATE THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS PREPARED OR TO
REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ARE
NO LONGER APPROPRIATE. SINCE THE MONMOUTH MULTI-YEAR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
COVERS MULTIPLE YEARS, SUCH INFORMATION BY ITS NATURE BECOMES LESS PREDICTIVE WITH EACH
SUCCESSIVE YEAR.
Monmouth may calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including NOI, EBITDA, FFO and AFFO (each as
defined below), using methodologies different from those used by other companies. Consequently, the financial
metrics presented in Monmouth’s prospective financial information disclosures and in the sections of this proxy
statement with respect to the opinions of the financial advisors to Monmouth may not be directly comparable to
those of other companies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Monmouth has not made and makes no representation to any Monmouth shareholder in the Merger Agreement or
otherwise concerning the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or regarding Monmouth’s ultimate
performance compared to the information contained in the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information or
that the projected results will be achieved.
Monmouth Multi-Year Projected Cash Flows
The following table sets forth selected unaudited prospective financial information representing Monmouth
management’s evaluation of Monmouth’s estimated standalone future financial performance based on an internal
financial model that Monmouth has historically used in connection with its annual budgeting and strategic planning
process. The following Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was finalized on October 14, 2021. The
Monmouth multi-year projected financial information was based on numerous variables and assumptions, including
the variables and assumptions discussed above, as well as the following material assumptions: (1) Cash NOI,
Adjusted EBITDA (ex. Interest/Dividend Income), FFO and AFFO per share (each as defined below) projections
based on Monmouth’s business plan for 2022 through 2026; (2) acquisitions at initial cash capitalization rates of 4.5%
to 5.9%; (3) general and administrative expense at approximately 5% of total income; (4) new debt issued at an
interest rate ranging from approximately 1.6% to 2.75%; and (5) AFFO payout ratio at approximately 75% or higher.
The Monmouth multi-year projected financial information does not give effect to the Merger. The Monmouth multi-
year projected financial information was provided to Monmouth’s board of directors and to J.P. Morgan, CSCA, and
ILPT, and a summary is presented in the following table, with all figures rounded to the nearest million, except per
share data. Monmouth’s management directed J.P. Morgan and CSCA to use and rely upon the Monmouth multi-year
projected financial information for purposes of their respective opinions and related financial analyses. For more
information, see “The Merger- Background of the Merger.”

Monmouth defines net operating income (“NOI”) as Net Income (Loss), as such term is defined under GAAP, attributable to
Monmouth’s common shareholders, plus preferred dividends, general and administrative expenses, non-recurring costs relating to
Monmouth’s strategic alternative process and proxy fight (including litigation and certain other non-routine costs), depreciation,
amortization of capitalized lease costs and intangible assets and interest expense, including amortization of financing costs,
unrealized holding (gains) or losses arising during the periods, less dividend income, gain on sale of securities transactions, and
lease termination income. The components of NOI consist of recurring rental and reimbursement revenue, less real estate taxes
and operating expenses, such as insurance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. Monmouth defines Cash NOI as NOI as adjusted
to exclude the impact of certain GAAP adjustments included in rental revenue, such as straight-line rent adjustments and
amortization of above-market intangible lease assets and below-market lease intangible liabilities.
(2)
Monmouth defines adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as Net Income (Loss), as such term is defined under GAAP,
attributable to Monmouth’s common shareholders, plus preferred dividend expense, interest expense, including amortization of
financing costs, depreciation, amortization of capitalized lease costs and intangible assets, non-recurring strategic alternatives and
proxy costs (including litigation and certain other non-routine costs) and unrealized holding losses arising during the relevant
period, less gain on sale of securities transactions and gain on sale of real estate investments. The Adjusted EBITDA item set
forth in the tables above also excludes interest and dividend income.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(3)
Monmouth defines funds from operations (“FFO”) as such term is defined by The National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (Nareit). Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common shareholders, as defined under GAAP,
excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, impairment charges related to depreciable real
estate assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization. Included in the Nareit FFO
White Paper - 2018 Restatement, is an option pertaining to assets incidental to our main business in the calculation of Nareit
FFO to make an election to include or exclude mark-to-market changes in the value recognized on these marketable equity
securities. In conjunction with the adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, for all periods presented, Monmouth
has elected to exclude unrealized gains and losses from its investments in marketable equity securities from our FFO calculation.
Nareit created FFO as a non-GAAP supplemental measure of REIT operating performance.
(4)
Monmouth defines adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) as FFO as adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense,
depreciation of corporate office tenant improvements, amortization of deferred financing costs, gains on the sale of securities,
lease termination income, non-recurring costs relating to Monmouth’s strategic alternative process and proxy fight (including
litigation and certain other non-routine costs), effect of non-cash GAAP straight-line rent adjustments and less recurring capital
expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures are defined as all capital expenditures that are recurring in nature, excluding capital
expenditures related to expansions at Monmouth’s existing properties or capital expenditures that are incurred in conjunction
with obtaining a new lease or a lease renewal.
In addition to the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information described above, Monmouth management
provided to J.P. Morgan and CSCA, for their use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses
and opinions, unaudited unlevered free cash flow projections for Monmouth on a standalone basis for the three-
months ending December 31, 2021, and for the calendar years ending December 31, 2022, December 31, 2023,
December 31, 2024, December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2026 (“Unlevered Free Cash Flow”). The Unlevered Free
Cash Flow for Monmouth was arithmetically derived from the Monmouth multi-year projected financial information
and approved by Monmouth for use by J.P. Morgan and CSCA.

MONMOUTH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT CORP_20211221_DEFM14A_19731738_4356032.Pdf,Financing,"Financing
The obligation of ILPT under the Merger Agreement to complete the Merger is not conditioned on ILPT’s obtaining
funds or financing.
The funds required to consummate the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the fees and
expenses associated with the acquisition and financing) will be obtained by one or more of the following:
•
debt financing committed by certain lenders, pursuant to a commitment letter, dated as of the date of the
Merger Agreement (the “Debt Commitment Letter”), to make available to ILPT a bridge loan, under which
ILPT may borrow up to $4.0 billion on a short-term basis for 364 days (the “Debt Financing”), or alternative
financing as permitted under the Merger Agreement;
•
an equity contribution through investments by equity partners; and/or
•
other funds available to ILPT, including through alternative or substitute financing.
ILPT has represented in the Merger Agreement that the amounts committed under the Debt Commitment Letter,
together with any alternative financing or equity financing and any other funds available to ILPT, will be sufficient to
fund the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Preferred Stock Consideration, to repay existing debt of
Monmouth or its subsidiaries and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing or the Merger.
Pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, certain lenders have committed to provide the Debt Financing to ILPT in the
form of an up to $4.0 billion bridge loan. The joint lead arrangers and bookrunners for the Debt Financing are
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and UBS AG, Stamford Branch. The Debt Financing is contemplated to be secured by
all or a portion of 101 industrial and logistical properties owned by subsidiaries of ILPT and the properties of
Monmouth that are to be acquired pursuant to the Merger. The Debt Financing is subject to customary conditions
precedent, including the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement.
52TABLE OF CONTENTS
ILPT cannot, without Monmouth’s prior written consent, permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or
modification to the Debt Commitment Letter if it (i) decreases the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (except to
the extent ILPT has arranged alternative financing), (ii) could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Merger, (iii) materially and adversely impacts the ability of ILPT to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or (iv) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing.
Monmouth is required to use reasonable best efforts to provide customary cooperation to ILPT in connection with
the Debt Financing, any alternative financing or equity financing, subject to certain limitations. See the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Financing” for more information.
ILPT may pursue alternative options to finance all or a portion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including permanent financing and options to reduce the amount borrowed under Debt Financing
through investments by equity partners or other debt financing. Any such alternative financing must provide for at
least the same amount of funding as contemplated by the Debt Financing and must not be subject to any condition
precedent materially less favorable than the conditions precedent contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and could
not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

In considering the recommendation of Monmouth’s board of directors to approve the Merger, Monmouth’s
shareholders should be aware that Monmouth’s directors and executive officers have certain interests in the Merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Monmouth’s shareholders generally, including the receipt
of consideration in exchange for cancellation of outstanding unvested equity awards, the receipt of contractual
severance and/or transaction bonus payments by certain executive officers, and the right to continued
indemnification and insurance coverage. Monmouth’s board of directors was aware of those interests and considered
them, among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve the execution of the Merger Agreement and in making
its recommendation that Monmouth’s common shareholders vote to approve the Merger. These interests include the
interests described below in this section. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement will constitute a “change in control,” “change of control” or term of similar meaning for purposes of
Monmouth’s executive compensation arrangements, including the benefit plans and agreements described below.

Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payment and benefits described in
this section, the following assumptions were used:
•
The relevant price per share of Monmouth Common Stock is $21.00, which is the Merger Consideration;
•
The Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on December 20, 2021, which is the assumed date of
the Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each executive officer was terminated by Monmouth without “cause” or due to the
executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and
agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on the assumed date of the Effective Time
of December 20, 2021.
The amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation
actions that may occur before completion of the Merger.
Treatment of Monmouth’s Equity Awards
Stock Options
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each stock option issued pursuant to Monmouth’s
equity incentive plan, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and the holder thereof will become entitled to
receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect to such stock option, an amount in cash equal to
the excess of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such stock option, multiplied
by the number of shares of Monmouth Common Stock subject to such stock option, subject to any applicable
withholding tax.
Restricted Stock Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each unvested restricted stock award issued pursuant to
Monmouth’s equity incentive plan will be canceled and the holder thereof will then become entitled to receive, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect to such award, an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each restricted share covered by such restricted stock award, plus accumulated and
unpaid dividends with respect to such stock award, subject to any applicable withholding tax.
Value of Outstanding Equity Awards
See the section entitled “The Merger-Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Monmouth’s Executive Officers” for
an estimate of the value of each of Monmouth’s named executive officer’s unvested equity awards. Based on the
assumptions described above under “The Merger-Interests of Monmouth’s Executive Officers and Directors in the
Merger-Certain Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable at the Effective Time to
Monmouth’s ten non-employee directors in respect of their unvested restricted stock awards granted prior to the
date of the Merger Agreement is $37,000.
For more information on the equity holdings of Monmouth’s directors and executive officers, see the table entitled
“Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.”
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance
In connection with the Merger, Monmouth’s directors and officers will receive certain insurance and indemnification
under the Merger Agreement. For specific terms thereof, see “The Merger Agreement-Employees, Directors, and
Officers-Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.”
Director Arrangements
Prior to the Closing, Monmouth may pay to each non-employee director a cash payment equal to the director fees
that such non-employee director would have received for the period from the Closing through December 31, 2022 had
the Closing not occurred. Based on the assumptions described above under “The Merger-Interests of Monmouth’s
Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger-Certain Assumptions,” the aggregate amount of such cash payments
for Monmouth’s ten non-employee directors would be $546,000.
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Management Arrangements
Transaction Success Program
In connection with the Merger, Monmouth intends to establish a cash retention program for employees in an
aggregate amount that, taken together with any Closing director compensation payments (see “The Merger-Interests
of Monmouth’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger-Director Arrangements” above), does not exceed $3
million to promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the Merger (the “Transaction Success
Program”). Awards under the Transaction Success Program will be allocated by Michael Landy or his designee (or,
for an award to an executive officer, by the compensation committee of Monmouth's board of directors) and will vest
upon the Effective Time, subject to the participant’s continued service with Monmouth through the Effective Time,
and be paid within 30 days after the Effective Time. Employees (including executive officers) will be eligible to receive
awards under such program, but the recipients of such awards and their respective award amounts have not yet been
determined as of the date of this proxy statement.
Employment Arrangements
Monmouth is party to employment agreements with each of Eugene Landy, Michael Landy, and Kevin Miller that
provide certain benefits upon termination of employment in connection with a change in control (which would
include the Merger). It is expected that the employment of each of Eugene Landy, Michael Landy and Kevin Miller
will terminate at the Effective Time and such termination will, in the case of Messrs. Landy, Landy, and Miller, entitle
such executive officer to receive the change in control related severance benefits described below.
Eugene Landy. Upon any termination of Eugene Landy’s employment for any reason, Mr. Landy’s employment
agreement provides for aggregate termination payments of $500,000, payable to Mr. Landy in installments of $100,000
per year for five years. In addition, upon the termination of Mr. Landy’s employment, following, or as a result of,
certain types of transactions that lead to a significant increase in Monmouth’s market capitalization, the employment
agreement provides that Mr. Landy is entitled to receive a grant of between 35,000 and 65,000 shares of Monmouth
Common Stock, depending on the amount of the increase in Monmouth’s market capitalization. It has been
determined that this provision will result in Mr. Landy receiving a grant of 50,000 shares of Monmouth Common
Stock in connection with the termination of his employment as a result of the Merger. Such shares will be cancelled in
the Merger in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. In addition, if Mr. Landy’s employment terminates
following, or as a result of, any such transaction, his employment agreement provides that all of his outstanding
options to purchase shares of Monmouth Common Stock will become immediately vested, and he will be entitled to
continue to receive benefits under Monmouth’s health insurance and similar plans for one year. In the event of a
change in control, Mr. Landy is also entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $2,500,000, provided that the sale price
is at least $10 per share of Monmouth Common Stock. All compensatory payments are subject to applicable
withholding tax.
Michael Landy. Upon a termination of Michael Landy’s employment without “cause” or by Mr. Landy for “good
reason”, Mr. Landy’s employment agreement provides that his severance package will consist of his base salary as in
effect immediately prior to his termination plus his Annual Cash Bonus Target (as defined in the employment
agreement) for the remaining term of the agreement (inclusive of any renewals), plus the cost of medical, dental
and/or vision benefit coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, also referred to
as COBRA, for up to 18 months after his termination of employment for Mr. Landy (and his spouse and eligible
dependents who were covered immediately prior to Mr. Landy’s termination of employment). The agreement further
provides that if Mr. Landy remains employed through a “change of control”, his employment agreement is treated as
automatically renewed for three years from the date of the change of control and if his employment with Monmouth is
terminated either by Monmouth without “cause” or by Mr. Landy for “good reason”, within 18 months after a change
of control, then, and in addition to the payments of base salary and Annual Cash Bonus Target, all of Mr. Landy’s
unvested and outstanding equity awards will automatically vest effective immediately prior to such termination of
employment. Mr. Landy is also entitled to participate in the Transaction Success Program in accordance with its
terms, however, no award has been allocated to Mr. Landy as of the date of this proxy statement. All compensatory
payments are subject to applicable withholding tax.
55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Kevin Miller. Upon a termination of Kevin Miller’s employment without “cause” or by Mr. Miller for “good reason”,
Mr. Miller’s employment agreement provides that he will be entitled to the greater of the base salary due under the
remaining term of the agreement or one year’s base salary as of the date of termination, paid monthly over the
remaining term of the agreement. In the event of a merger, sale or change of voting control (with certain limited
exceptions), Mr. Miller has the right to extend and renew his employment agreement so that the expiration date will be
three years from the date of the merger, sale or change of voting control. As a result of the Merger, Mr. Miller will be
entitled to extend and renew his employment agreement. Following the Merger, if Mr. Miller’s employment were to
terminate without cause or if he were to elect to terminate his employment for “good reason”, the termination of Mr.
Miller’s employment would result in the payment of the aforementioned benefits. After the signing of the Merger
Agreement, Monmouth amended and restated Mr. Miller’s employment agreement, which, among other things,
provided that (i) Mr. Miller’s annual base salary for calendar year 2022 will be $700,000, (ii) a diminution or adverse
change in Mr. Miller’s title, without his consent, will constitute “good reason”, and (iii) Mr. Miller’s severance
benefits upon a qualifying termination will be equal to his base salary as in effect immediately prior to the qualifying
termination of employment plus his annual target bonus for the greater of (x) the remainder of the term as extended
above (but in no event greater than three years) and (y) one year, and the payment of the cost of COBRA benefits for
up to 18 months. Mr. Miller is also entitled to participate in the Transaction Success Program in accordance with its
terms, however, no award has been allocated to Mr. Miller as of the date of this proxy statement. All compensatory
payments are subject to applicable withholding tax.
Change in Control Severance Plan
Each of Monmouth’s executive officers and employees, other than Eugene Landy, Michael Landy, and Kevin Miller,
participates in the Change in Control Severance Plan that was adopted by Monmouth’s board of directors in January
2021 (the “CIC Plan”). Pursuant to the CIC Plan, upon a termination of employment without “cause” within twelve
months following the Effective Time, each participating employee (including Messrs. Prashad and Molke, our two
executive officers who participate in the CIC Plan) would be entitled to receive a lump-sum cash payment, net of
applicable withholding tax, in an amount equal to two times the employee’s annual base salary and payment or
reimbursement of premiums for healthcare continuation coverage under COBRA for such employee and such
employee’s dependents for so long as they remain eligible for such coverage or until they obtain other healthcare
coverage, if earlier. In the event it is not possible to provide COBRA coverage on a subsidized basis, the employee
would receive a lump sum equal to the value of such subsidy, as reasonably determined, assuming that the applicable
employee remained eligible for 18 months of COBRA coverage. The employee’s receipt of severance is subject to the
execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims, and compliance with a customary non-disparagement
covenant relating to the employer and its affiliates. It is expected that each of Monmouth’s employees will be
terminated as of immediately after the Effective Time in a severance eligible manner, and as such, it is expected that
each participant in the CIC Plan will be entitled to the severance benefits described above.
Better Net After-Tax Cutback
To the extent that any payments or benefits that Eugene Landy, Michael Landy and Kevin Miller are or become
entitled to receive in connection with the Merger would constitute a “parachute payment” for purposes of Section
280G of the Code and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, Monmouth anticipates
working with the applicable executive officer to mitigate such excise tax exposure (including, where appropriate,
accelerating vesting and/or payments into 2021). And, if the tax exposure cannot be entirely mitigated, Monmouth
expects that each such executive officer would either (i) accept the aggregate payments and benefits without any
cutback and with the application of the excise tax or (ii) accept a lesser amount that would result in no portion of the
aggregate payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever would result in the receipt by the
executive officer of the greatest amount of aggregate payments and benefits on an after-tax basis.",62,65

•
The Effective Time as referenced in this section occurs on December 20, 2021, which is the assumed date of
the Effective Time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section; and
•
The employment of each executive officer was terminated by Monmouth without “cause” or due to the
executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and
agreements), in either case immediately following the Merger and on the assumed date of the Effective Time
of December 20, 2021.

Perquisites/Benefits. The amounts in this column represent the estimated value of the continued health care coverage benefits
following a qualifying termination to which each of Monmouth’s executive officers may become entitled under his employment
agreement or the CIC Severance Plan, as applicable, as described in the section above entitled “The Merger-Interests of

lump-sum payment equal to the executive officer’s accrued but unused vacation to which they would be entitled upon termination
of employment. For purposes of this disclosure, the amounts listed here are based on healthcare coverage elections and premiums
for 2021 and the vacation allowance to be credited as of January 1, 2022 and using 2021 base salary rates (without taking into
consideration any potential 2022 merit or market based increases) for all employees other than Michael Landy and Kevin Miller
(for whom calculation is based on increased rate of base salary to be effective as of January 1, 2022). Actual payouts at

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders
of Monmouth Common Stock. The following discussion is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”),
and judicial decisions and interpretations of the foregoing, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement.
These authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and any
such differing interpretation or change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein.
This discussion assumes that the Merger will be completed in accordance with the Merger Agreement and as further
described in this proxy statement. This discussion is for general information purposes only, is not a complete
description of all of the tax consequences of the Merger and, in particular, does not address any tax reporting
requirements, tax consequences arising under the unearned Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care
and Education Act of 2010, any considerations with respect to FATCA (which for this purpose means Sections 1471
through 1474 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any intergovernmental agreements
entered into in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such
agreement) or any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction, or under any
U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to income tax. In addition, this discussion is not binding on the IRS or
any court, and no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position
contrary to any statement or conclusion set forth in this discussion.
The following discussion applies only to holders of Monmouth Common Stock who hold such stock as capital assets
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further,
58TABLE OF CONTENTS
this discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to
holders in light of their particular circumstances and does not apply to holders subject to special treatment under the
U.S. federal income tax laws (such as, for example, banks and certain other financial institutions, tax-exempt
organizations, partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities (or investors in partnerships, S
corporations or other pass-through entities), regulated investment companies, controlled foreign corporations,
passive foreign investment companies, real estate investment trusts, insurance companies, mutual funds, dealers or
brokers in stocks and securities, commodities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market
method of accounting, holders who are required to recognize income or gain no later than such income or gain is
required to be reported on an applicable financial statement under Section 451(b) of the Code, holders subject to the
alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code, “qualified foreign pension funds” (within the meaning of Section
897(l)(2) of the Code) or entities all of the interests in which are held by a qualified pension fund, “qualified
shareholders” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or investors therein, non-U.S. holders (as defined
below) who hold, or have held at any time, directly, indirectly, or constructively, more than 10% of the Monmouth
Common Stock outstanding (except to the extent specifically set forth below) or more than 10% of the Monmouth
Preferred Stock outstanding, holders who acquired Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of employee
stock options, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation, U.S. holders (as defined below)
whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, holders who hold Monmouth Common Stock as part of a hedge,
straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, or U.S. expatriates).
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Monmouth Common Stock that is
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or
entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, organized in or under the laws of the United
States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to
exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons” (as defined
under the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) such trust has made a valid
election to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (iv) an estate, the income of
which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source. As used herein, the
term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Monmouth Common Stock that is not a U.S. holder or an entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If an entity or an arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Monmouth
Common Stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such partnership or a partner in such partnership generally
will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Monmouth Common Stock and any partners in such partnership are
urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Merger to their specific circumstances.
THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, IS NOT TAX ADVICE, AND IS NOT
INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF ALL TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO
THE MERGER. EACH HOLDER OF MONMOUTH COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX
ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO SUCH
HOLDER’S PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS WITH RESPECT TO ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT OR OTHER TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE
LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-UNITED STATES TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY
APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY, OR ANY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND ANY PENDING
OR PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Merger Generally
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties will treat the Merger as a taxable sale by Monmouth of all of
Monmouth’s assets to ILPT in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the Preferred Stock Consideration, the
assumption of all of Monmouth’s liabilities and any other applicable amounts, followed immediately by the
distribution of such Merger Consideration and Preferred Stock Consideration (and any other applicable amounts) to
the holders of equity interests in Monmouth in complete liquidation of Monmouth pursuant to Revenue Ruling 69-6,
1969-1 C.B. 104, Section 331(a) of the Code and Section 562(b)(1) of the Code. Because, as a REIT,
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Monmouth is entitled to receive a deduction for liquidating distributions, and Monmouth anticipates that its deemed
liquidating distribution will exceed its taxable income recognized as a result of the Merger (together with any other
undistributed taxable income recognized in the taxable year of the Merger), Monmouth anticipates that it will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Monmouth Common Stock
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for their Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder of Monmouth Common Stock that
receives cash in exchange for its shares of Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received (determined before the deduction of
any applicable withholding taxes, as described below under “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger-Information Reporting and Backup Withholding”) and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted
tax basis in such shares. Any such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain
or loss if such U.S. holder’s holding period in its Monmouth Common Stock surrendered in the Merger is more than
one year as of the date of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals,
are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.
If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Monmouth Common Stock at different times and different prices, such
U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each
block of Monmouth Common Stock.
A U.S. holder who has held Monmouth Common Stock for six months or less at the time of the Merger, taking into
account the holding period rules of Sections 246(c)(3) and (4) of the Code, and who recognizes a loss on the
exchange of such Monmouth Common Stock in the Merger will generally be treated as recognizing a long-term capital
loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends received from Monmouth, or such holder’s share of any designated
retained capital gains, with respect to such Monmouth Common Stock.
Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders of Monmouth Common Stock
A non-U.S. holder’s gain or loss from the Merger will generally be determined in the same manner as that of a U.S.
holder. Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below under “The Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger-Information Reporting and Backup Withholding,” a non-U.S. holder generally should
not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain or loss from the receipt of the cash in exchange for Monmouth
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, except as described below.
Gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder upon a sale or exchange of shares of Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger generally will not be taxed under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (“FIRPTA”) if
Monmouth is a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity,” defined generally to include a REIT, less than
50% in value of the stock of which is and was held directly or indirectly by foreign persons at all times during a
specified testing period (provided that, if any class of a REIT’s stock is regularly traded on an established securities
market in the U.S., a person holding less than 5% of such class during the testing period is generally presumed not to
be a foreign person, unless the REIT has actual knowledge otherwise). Monmouth believes that it is a “domestically
controlled qualified investment entity,” and, therefore, assuming that Monmouth is a “domestically controlled
qualified investment entity” at the Effective Time, that taxation under FIRPTA will not apply to the receipt of cash in
exchange for shares of Monmouth Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.
If Monmouth does not qualify as a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity,” the tax consequences to a
non-U.S. holder of an exchange of shares of Monmouth Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will depend
upon whether such stock is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States and the amount
of such stock that is held by the non-U.S. holder. Monmouth believes that Monmouth Common Stock is regularly
traded on an established securities market in the United States within the meaning of FIRPTA and the applicable
Treasury regulations. Therefore, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax under
FIRPTA. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences of the
Merger to them, including the applicability of FIRPTA. In particular, a non-U.S. holder who has held more than 10% of
Monmouth Common Stock at any time during the
60
TABLE OF CONTENTS
one-year period ending on the date of the Merger or a non-U.S. holder who is a “qualified shareholder” (within the
meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) is urged to consult its tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of the
receipt of the Merger Consideration.
However, even if not subject to FIRPTA, gain recognized by a non-U.S. holder as a result of the Merger will be
taxable to such holder if such gain is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s U.S. trade or
business and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty as a condition for subjecting the non-U.S. holder to U.S.
taxation on a net income basis, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that the non-U.S. holder
maintains in the U.S. In this case, the same treatment that applies to U.S. holders with respect to the gain will
generally apply to the non-U.S. holder, and a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to the 30%
branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such gain. In
addition, any such gain will be taxable to a non-U.S. holder if the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual
who was present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year or maintains an office or a fixed place of
business in the U.S. to which the gain is attributable. In such cases, a 30% tax (or such lower rate as may be specified
by an applicable income tax treaty) will apply to the nonresident alien individual’s capital gains, which may be offset
by certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident
of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to
such losses.
Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules in light of
their particular facts and circumstances and the procedures for claiming treaty benefits or otherwise establishing an
exemption from U.S. withholding tax.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Holders may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a
rate of 24%) with respect to cash received pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding will generally not apply,
however, to a holder who (1) in the case of a U.S. holder, furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on a properly completed and duly executed IRS Form W-9, (2) in
the case of a non-U.S. holder, furnishes a properly completed and duly executed, applicable IRS Form W-8, or (3) is
otherwise exempt from backup withholding and complies with all applicable rules and certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
claimed as a refund or a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) provided the required
information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis.
This discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and
is not tax advice. Holders of Monmouth Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax
consequences to them of the Merger, including the effect of any federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax laws.
Dividends",67,70

The Merger Agreement permits Monmouth to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends on the outstanding shares of
Monmouth Common Stock in an amount not exceeding $0.18 per share for each completed quarter until the
consummation of the Merger, quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding Monmouth Preferred Stock in an amount
equal to $0.3828125 per share, and distributions reasonably necessary for Monmouth to maintain its REIT status and
avoid or reduce the imposition of any entity level income or excise tax under the Code (or applicable state law).
In the event that Monmouth declares or pays any dividend or other distribution that is reasonably necessary to
maintain its REIT status and avoid or reduce the imposition of any entity level income or excise tax under the Code
(or applicable state law) in excess of the permitted $0.18 per share of Monmouth Common Stock per quarter, such
excess amount will reduce the Merger Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

Beginning on December 13, 2021, purported shareholders of Monmouth filed two lawsuits against Monmouth and
members of Monmouth’s board of directors, challenging disclosures related to the Merger. The complaints (the
“Complaints”), Wang v. Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, et al., No. 1:21-cv-10632 (S.D.N.Y.) and
Whitfield v. Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, et al., No. 1:21-cv-10854 (S.D.N.Y.), allege, among other
things, that Monmouth and its directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder and that Monmouth’s directors violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by causing the filing of a proxy
statement relating to the Merger with the SEC that misstates or omits certain allegedly material information.
The Complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the consummation of the Merger, rescission of
the Merger to the extent implemented (or rescissory damages), accounting for damages, declaration that Monmouth
and its directors violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, and an award of
the plaintiff’s costs, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees. Monmouth believes that all of the claims asserted in the
Complaints are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against such actions. However, litigation is inherently
uncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that the defense of the actions will be successful. If
the lawsuits are successful, they could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in costs to Monmouth.
Additional lawsuits relating to the Merger may also be filed in the future.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS
Holders of shares of Monmouth Common Stock or Monmouth Preferred Stock are not entitled to exercise any
appraisal rights, dissenters’ rights or the rights of an objecting shareholder to receive the fair value of the
shareholder’s shares in connection with the Merger because, as permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law,
Monmouth’s charter provides that shareholders are not entitled to exercise such rights unless Monmouth’s board of
directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire board of directors, determines that the rights will apply
to the Merger. Monmouth’s board of directors has made no such determination and the Merger Agreement provides
that no such rights will be available. In addition, under the Maryland General Corporation Law, holders of shares
listed on a securities exchange generally are also not entitled to such rights. However, holders of shares of
Monmouth Common Stock can vote against the Merger.

This section of this proxy statement summarizes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is attached
as Annex A to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference.
This summary may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you.
Monmouth urges you to carefully read the full text of the Merger Agreement because it is the legal document that
governs the Merger. The Merger Agreement is not intended to provide you with any factual information about
Monmouth or ILPT. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the
Merger Agreement (and summarized below) are qualified by certain information Monmouth filed with the SEC
prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, as well as by certain disclosure schedules Monmouth delivered to ILPT
in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, which modify, qualify and create exceptions to the
representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, some of those representations and
warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date, may apply contractual standards of
materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by investors or that is different from
standards of materiality generally applicable under the U.S. federal securities laws or may not be intended as
statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk among the parties to the Merger Agreement. The
representations and warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement and the description of such
provisions in this proxy statement should not be read alone but instead should be read in conjunction with the
other information contained in the reports, statements and filings that Monmouth files with the SEC and the other
information in this proxy statement. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The Merger Agreement provides that the Closing will take place remotely by electronic exchange of documents and
signatures at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fifth business day after the Condition Satisfaction Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may agree on another time or date. In addition, in the event that the
closing conditions are satisfied or waived such that the Closing Date would otherwise occur prior to the date that is
90 days after the date of the Merger Agreement (February 3, 2022), ILPT has the right to extend the Closing Date
once to a date that is no later than February 3, 2022 by providing written notice to Monmouth no later than the
Condition Satisfaction Date. If the closing conditions are satisfied or waived such that the Closing Date would
otherwise occur on or after February 3, 2022, ILPT does not have the right to extend the Closing Date. ILPT also has
the right to accelerate the then-scheduled Closing Date to a date specified by ILPT by giving at least three business
days written notice to Monmouth at any time after the Condition Satisfaction Date.
As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties will file the articles of merger with respect to the Merger with
the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland and a certificate of merger with respect to the
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Closing.
At the Effective Time, any managers and officers of the Merger Sub will be the managers and officers of the surviving

Definition of Material Adverse Effect
Many of the representations of Monmouth and of ILPT are qualified by a “Company Material Adverse Effect” (in the
case of Monmouth) or by a “Parent Material Adverse Effect” (in the case of ILPT) standard (that is, they will not be
deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable).

aggregate, is or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities,

markets or market conditions, including changes in interest rates, inflation and credit conditions;
(b)
national or international political conditions or changes therein (including the commencement, continuation

(d)
any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of Monmouth or any of its subsidiaries with its lessees,

identity of ILPT, the execution of the Merger Agreement or the announcement, negotiation, existence or
performance of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (provided, that this clause (d) will
not apply to the use of Company Material Adverse Effect in Monmouth’s representations and warranties
regarding absence of conflict with or violation of organizational documents, applicable laws, or certain
agreements, or closing condition related to such representations and warranties);
(e)
changes in GAAP, the rules or policies of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or any
applicable law or interpretation, application or enforcement of any of the foregoing;
(f)
any failure by Monmouth to meet any internal or external projections, forecasts or estimates of revenues,
earnings, cash flow, funds from operations or other metrics for any period (provided that the exception in
this clause (f) will not preclude a determination that any event, change, circumstance or effect underlying
such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the extent not
otherwise excluded under other clauses);
(g)
the suspension of trading in securities on the NYSE or a decline in the price, or a change in the trading
volume, of the Monmouth Common Stock on the NYSE (provided that the exception in this clause (g) will

any change or announcement of a potential change in the credit rating of Monmouth or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their securities (provided that the exception in this clause (j) will not preclude a

a potential change has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the extent not
otherwise excluded under other clauses); or
(k)
compliance by Monmouth with the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the failure of Monmouth to
take any action as a result of the interim operating covenants, or any actions taken, or failure to take any
action, which ILPT has requested in writing or to which ILPT has consented in writing.

In addition, nothing in the Merger Agreement prohibits Monmouth from taking any action, or refraining from taking
any action, in good faith to respond to the actual or anticipated effects of COVID-19 or any Contagion Event. Such
action must be consistent with Monmouth’s actions taken prior to the date of the Merger Agreement in response to
COVID-19 or, to the extent not consistent with Monmouth’s past practices in response to COVID-19, may be taken
only after reasonable notice to and good faith consultation with ILPT and only if commercially reasonable.
Preparation of the Proxy Statement
Monmouth has agreed to prepare and file with the SEC this proxy statement as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement. Monmouth has also agreed to other customary covenants
related to the preparation of the proxy statement, including using its reasonable best efforts to have this proxy
statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. ILPT has agreed to furnish to Monmouth all
information relating to ILPT as may be reasonably requested by Monmouth in connection with the preparation, filing
and mailing of this proxy statement.
Monmouth Shareholders Meeting
Monmouth has agreed that it will duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of
Monmouth for the purpose of obtaining the requisite vote of its shareholders to approve the Merger as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments on this proxy statement or that
Monmouth may commence distribution of this proxy statement, unless the Merger Agreement has been validly
terminated. Monmouth has further agreed to customary covenants related to its shareholders meeting, such as using
reasonable best efforts to solicit the requisite vote of its shareholders to approve the Merger and including in this
proxy statement the recommendation of Monmouth’s board of directors that Monmouth’s shareholders vote in favor
of the Merger.
Regulatory Efforts; Notifications
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each of Monmouth, ILPT and Merger Sub has agreed
to use reasonable best efforts to take the actions and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable under the
Merger Agreement and applicable laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary to cause the conditions to the closing of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement
to be satisfied, (ii) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documents to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, clearances,
waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, authorizations, approvals and permits contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, (iii) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary or advisable to make all necessary filings and obtain
all such consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, authorizations, approvals and permits, and (iv)
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other governmental entity vacated or reversed, and the
avoidance of each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition, trade regulation or other
law or regulation that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under any
applicable law or if any suit is instituted by any governmental entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as violative of any applicable law, each of Monmouth, ILPT and
Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenges so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than the Outside Date.
Monmouth and ILPT have agreed to promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received by
such party from any governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (b) any Action commenced, or, to such party’s knowledge, threatened
in writing against such party or any of its subsidiaries that relates to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.
Certain Sales Activities
Monmouth has agreed to use reasonable best efforts (including causing its subsidiaries and representatives to use
their respective reasonable best efforts) to provide to ILPT all pre-closing cooperation reasonably requested by ILPT
in writing in connection with any sales or marketing efforts relating to potential sales of Monmouth’s real properties,
subject to certain limitations.
Financing
ILPT has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions and do all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain funds sufficient for the satisfaction of all of ILPT’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement
and the Debt Commitment Letter, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any fees and expenses of or
payable by ILPT or Merger Sub under the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter and for
the prepayment, repayment, refinancing or satisfaction and discharge of all outstanding debt of Monmouth and its
subsidiaries that is required by its terms to be prepaid, repaid, refinanced or satisfied and discharged at the Closing
(such amounts, the “Merger Amounts”). ILPT has also agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to obtain the proceeds of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (the “Debt Financing”), on
the terms and subject only to the conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as possible but in
any event prior to the Outside Date, including by (i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiating
and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the “Definitive Agreements”) consistent
with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the “flex”
provisions contained in any related fee letter), (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Definitive Agreements and complying with its obligations thereunder and (iv) enforcing its rights
under the Debt Commitment Letter.
In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, ILPT is
required to (i) promptly notify Monmouth in writing of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
alternative financing for any such portion from alternative financing sources (the “Alternative Financing”) in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Debt Financing, to fund the Merger
Amounts and which does not include any conditions to the consummation of such Alternative Financing that are
more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of the Merger Agreement.
ILPT has the right from time to time prior to the Closing to obtain in replacement or supplement of the Debt
Commitment Letter for all or a portion of the Debt Financing other debt commitment letters from alternative lenders
and/or equity commitment letters (the “Replacement Financing”) that provide for at least the same amount of funding
as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and provided that such Replacement Financing (i) is not subject to
any condition precedent materially less favorable than the conditions precedent contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) could not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
75
TABLE OF CONTENTS
ILPT has acknowledged and agreed that its compliance with the foregoing obligations will not relieve ILPT of its
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement whether or not the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing is available and that in no event will the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including the Debt Financing) by ILPT, any of its affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be
a condition to any of ILPT’s obligations under the Merger Agreement.
Financing Cooperation
Prior to the Closing, Monmouth has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts, and to cause each of its subsidiaries to
use reasonable best efforts, to provide customary cooperation, to the extent reasonably requested by ILPT in writing,
in connection with the offering, arrangement, syndication, consummation, or issuance of the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing or Replacement Financing obtained in accordance with provisions above (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Monmouth or any of its
affiliates), including, to the extent so requested, using reasonable best efforts to:

Employee Severance
Except as otherwise agreed in writing between ILPT and any employee of Monmouth or any subsidiary of
Monmouth, the employment of each employee of Monmouth or its subsidiaries will be terminated as of immediately
after the Effective Time. Such termination will entitle each such employee to receive termination and severance
compensation and benefits under the applicable employment, change in control, severance and termination
protection plan or agreement between Monmouth or any of Monmouth’s subsidiaries and such employee, in each
case, as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement or, to the extent permitted by Monmouth’s interim operating
covenants, entered into or amended, modified or supplemented after the date of the Merger Agreement, and ILPT will
cause each such plan or agreement to be honored in accordance with its terms.
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance
From and after the Effective Time, ILPT will, and will cause the surviving entity in the Merger to, to the fullest extent
permitted by law (including to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the
Maryland General Corporation Law adopted after the date of the Merger Agreement that increase the extent to which
a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors) and the constituent documents of Monmouth in effect on the
date of the Merger Agreement, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance expenses, subject to reasonable
and customary undertaking to repay such advances if it is determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification) the present and former directors and officers of Monmouth and its subsidiaries, and any fiduciaries
under any benefit plan of Monmouth (each, an “Indemnified Party”), against any and all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative, arising out of (in whole or in part), relating to or in
connection with any circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged
to occur prior to or at the Effective Time, including the approval of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or arising
out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, without written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably conditions, withheld or delayed), ILPT and the surviving entity in the Merger may not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation relating to any circumstances, developments or matters in existence at or prior to the Effective Time, or
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Claim”), for which indemnification could be
sought by an Indemnified Party under the Merger Agreement, unless (a) such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim and (b) such
settlement, compromise or consent does not include or provide for any acknowledgement or other statement of fault
or wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party. ILPT, the surviving entity in the Merger, and the Indemnified Parties are
also subject to customary cooperation and access obligations with respect to defense of Claims. In the event of any
Claim, ILPT has the right to assume the defense of such Claim, subject to certain exceptions for actual or potential
conflicts of interest.
For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the surviving entity in the Merger will (and ILPT will cause the
surviving entity to) honor the provisions in Monmouth’s constituent documents in effect as of the date of the
Merger Agreement providing for indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnified Parties,
as applicable, with respect to the facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted from time to time under applicable law.
From and after the Effective Time, ILPT and the surviving entity in the Merger will comply with, and will not, directly
or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate, the advancement of expenses, exculpation and indemnification
provisions of any agreements between Monmouth and any of the Indemnified Parties in effect as of the date of the
Merger Agreement.
In the event Monmouth’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement lapse prior to the Effective Time or its runoff coverage under such insurance otherwise would not survive
for six years after the Effective Time, ILPT has agreed to cause the surviving entity in the Merger to

procure and maintain for at least six years after the Effective Time, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts with reputable and financial sound carriers containing terms no less
advantageous to such former directors and officers and that do not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect
to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, subject to certain premium cap.

Monmouth has agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries and the directors and officers of Monmouth and its
subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted prior to the date of the
Merger Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (as defined below).
Monmouth further agreed that, except as described below, it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and the directors
and officers of Monmouth and its subsidiaries not to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal, (ii) enter into, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal, or (iii) furnish to any person any non-public material information in connection with any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal. However, the Merger Agreement permits Monmouth to terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce
any provision of any “standstill” or similar obligation of any person solely to the extent necessary to allow such
person to submit a Takeover Proposal on a confidential basis.
Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth above, at any time prior to obtaining approval of the Merger by
Monmouth’s common shareholders, in response to an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal received after the date
of the Merger Agreement that did not arise as a result of a material breach of Monmouth’s nonsolicitation
obligations, (i) Monmouth and its representatives may contact the person or group of persons making such Takeover
Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if Monmouth’s board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with Monmouth’s financial advisors and its outside legal counsel) that such a proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such actions would, or
would be reasonably likely to, be inconsistent with its directors’ duties under applicable law, Monmouth and its
representatives may:
•
furnish information with respect to Monmouth and its subsidiaries to the person or group making such
Takeover Proposal, subject to prior execution of a confidentiality agreement that is no less restrictive in the
aggregate than the confidentiality agreement between Monmouth and ILPT and Monmouth providing to
ILPT concurrently or prior to such time all such information; and
•
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or group of persons making such Takeover
Proposal regarding such Takeover Proposal.
Except as described below, neither Monmouth’s board of directors nor any committee thereof may (i) withhold,
withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to ILPT) the recommendation of Monmouth’s board of directors
that the holders of Monmouth Common Stock approve the Merger (“Monmouth Board Recommendation”), (ii) fail to
include the Monmouth Board Recommendation in this proxy statement, (iii) authorize, approve, adopt or recommend
(publicly propose or resolve to do the foregoing) any Takeover Proposal, or (iv) allow Monmouth or any of its
subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement partnership agreement or other
similar contract (other than a confidentiality agreement) providing for or with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
Actions specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) above are each referred to as a “Recommendation Withdrawal.”
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, at any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by
Monmouth’s common shareholders, Monmouth’s board of directors may make a Recommendation Withdrawal
following the occurrence of an Intervening Event (as defined below) if Monmouth’s board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would, or would be
reasonably likely to, be inconsistent with its directors’ duties under applicable law. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary above, at any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by
79TABLE OF CONTENTS
Monmouth’s common shareholders, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that did not arise from a
material breach of Monmouth’s nonsolicitation obligations, if (i) Monmouth’s board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and (ii) Monmouth’s board of directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would, or would be reasonably
likely to, be inconsistent with its directors’ duties under applicable law, Monmouth’s board of directors and/or any
authorized committee may make a Recommendation Withdrawal and/or Monmouth may terminate the Merger
Agreement in order to, concurrently with or immediately after such termination, enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal (subject to concurrent or prior payment of the termination fee as described below).
Monmouth’s board of directors may not make a Recommendation Withdrawal or terminate the Merger Agreement
pursuant to the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, unless (i) if such Recommendation Withdrawal is
not being made as a result of a Superior Proposal, Monmouth has provided to ILPT five business days’ prior written
notice setting forth in reasonably detail information describing the Intervening Event and advising ILPT that
Monmouth’s board of directors intends to make a Recommendation Withdrawal and specifying the reasons for the
Recommendation Withdrawal or (ii) if such Recommendation Withdrawal or termination is being made as a result of a
Superior Proposal, Monmouth has provided to ILPT five business days’ prior written notice advising ILPT that
Monmouth’s board of directors intends to make a Recommendation Withdrawal and specifying the reasons for the
Recommendation Withdrawal, including the identity of the person making such Superior Proposal and the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal. During such five business day period, if requested by ILPT,
Monmouth and ILPT will engage in negotiations regarding any amendment to the Merger Agreement proposed in
writing by ILPT. If at the end of such five business day period, Monmouth’s board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with Monmouth’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel), after taking into account any
amendments that ILPT has agreed in writing to make prior to the end of such five business day period, that (1) the
failure to make a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to such Intervening Event would, or would be reasonably
likely to, be inconsistent with its directors’ duties under applicable law or (2) such Takeover Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a Recommendation Withdrawal or terminate this Agreement, as
applicable, would, or would be reasonably likely to, be inconsistent with its directors’ duties under applicable law,
Monmouth’s board of directors may make a Recommendation Withdrawal or terminate the Merger Agreement. Any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such a Superior Proposal will result in a
new negotiation period, except that such a new negotiation period will be for two business days.
Monmouth will as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours after receipt) advise ILPT orally and in
writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal from any person seeking to have
discussions or negotiations or requesting information with respect to any Takeover Proposal and the material terms
and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including the identity of the person making such Takeover Proposal
and copies of all material agreements or documents evidencing such Takeover Proposal). Monmouth will then keep
ILPT reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and material terms of any such Takeover
Proposal.
Under the Merger Agreement, “Intervening Event” means an event, development or change in circumstances material
to Monmouth and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to Monmouth’s board of directors (or if
known, the material consequences of which were not known by Monmouth’s board of directors) as of or prior to the

Merger Agreement, but prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders;
provided, however, that the following will not constitute, or be considered in determining whether there has been, an
Intervening Event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the Merger Agreement, “Takeover Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than
ILPT or any of its subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series of transactions, (i) any direct or indirect
purchase or other acquisition by any person (other than ILPT or any of its subsidiaries) of shares of Monmouth
Common Stock representing more than 20% of Monmouth Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the
consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any
person that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person beneficially owning more than
20% of Monmouth Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange
offer; (ii) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person of assets (including any equity securities
of any subsidiary of Monmouth) that constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of Monmouth and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such purchase or
acquisition); or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving Monmouth as a result of which the holders of Monmouth Common
Stock immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction would cease to hold at least 80% of the total voting
power of Monmouth or any surviving entity (or any direct or indirect parent company thereof) immediately following
such transaction.
Under the Merger Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, written, unsolicited Takeover Proposal (with all
references to “20%” or 80% in the definition of Takeover Proposal being deemed to be references to “50%”) that (i) is
on terms that Monmouth’s board of directors determines in good faith (after consulting with Monmouth’s financial
advisors and outside legal counsel), taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of
the Takeover Proposal and the person making the Takeover Proposal that Monmouth’s board of directors (or any
committee) deems relevant, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the shareholders of Monmouth than
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (taking into account any amendments to which ILPT has
committed in writing pursuant to its match right) and (ii) is determined by Monmouth’s board of directors to be
reasonably likely of being consummated.",88,90

MONMOUTH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT CORP_20211221_DEFM14A_19731738_4356032.Pdf,Termination of the Merger Agreement,"Termination of the Merger Agreement
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the approval
of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders:
(a)
by mutual written consent of ILPT and Monmouth;
(b)
by either ILPT or Monmouth, if the Merger is not consummated on or before the Outside Date of May 5,
2022, provided that a party whose breach of any of its regulatory efforts obligations has been a principal
cause of the failure of the Merger to be consummated by the Outside Date may not invoke this termination
right;
(c)
by either ILPT or Monmouth, if, after the date of the Merger Agreement, any governmental entity of
competent jurisdiction issues an order or takes any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order or other action has become final and non-appealable,
provided that a party whose breach of any of its regulatory efforts obligations has been a principal cause
of such order or action may not invoke this termination right;

by either ILPT or Monmouth, if the approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders is not
obtained upon a vote taken thereon at a meeting of Monmouth’s shareholders (or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof);
(e)
by either ILPT or Monmouth, if the other party has breached or failed to perform any of its representations,

Merger; or
(g)
before the approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders, by Monmouth in order to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, in accordance with the conditions described
under “The Merger Agreement-Nonsolicitation and Recommendation Withdrawal” above.
In the event of any valid termination of the Merger Agreement, all obligations of the parties will terminate, and there
will be no liability on the part of any party with respect thereto, except for the confidentiality provisions related to
ILPT’s access to information and the provisions related to expenses, public announcements, effect of termination,
termination fees, and general provisions. However, none of ILPT, Merger Sub or Monmouth will be released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of any willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement or fraud prior to such
termination.
82TABLE OF CONTENTS
Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement
Monmouth has agreed to pay ILPT a termination fee of $72 million if (i) the Merger Agreement is terminated by either
party for failure of the Merger to be consummated by the Outside Date or for the failure to obtain the requisite
approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s common shareholders or by ILPT for Monmouth’s material breach of its
representation, warranties, covenants or agreements, (ii) a Takeover Proposal is first publicly proposed or announced
after the date of the Merger Agreement and not withdrawn or abandoned as of such termination (in the case of
termination for the Outside Date or for Monmouth’s material breach of its representation, warranties, covenants or
agreements) or as of the meeting of Monmouth’s shareholders (in the case of termination for failure to obtain
requisite approval of Monmouth’s common shareholders), and (iii) Monmouth enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to and consummates a transaction constituting a Takeover Proposal with any person within 12 months after
such termination. For purposes of this paragraph, each reference to “20%” or “80%” in the definition of Takeover
Proposal will be deemed to be a reference to “50%.”
In addition, Monmouth has also agreed to pay ILPT a termination fee of $72 million if Monmouth terminates the
Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or if ILPT
terminates the Merger Agreement for Monmouth’s board of directors’ Recommendation Withdrawal, failure to
recommend against a Takeover Proposal or failure to reaffirm its recommendation, in each case as required by the
Merger Agreement.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated for the failure to obtain the requisite approval of the Merger by Monmouth’s
common shareholders, Monmouth will reimburse ILPT and its affiliates for all of their out-of-pocket fees and
expenses actually incurred or accrued in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $10 million. This expense
reimbursement will be credited against the termination fee of $72 million payable by Monmouth, if such termination
fee is payable.",91,92

If the Merger is completed, Monmouth will not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2022 because Monmouth
will cease to exist upon completion of the Merger. However, if the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason,
Monmouth expects to convene and hold the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. A date has not been set for any
such 2022 annual meeting. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated and Monmouth holds a 2022 annual
meeting, Monmouth will make a public announcement of the annual meeting date in connection with its proxy
statement for such meeting.
In the event Monmouth holds a 2022 annual meeting, shareholders interested in presenting a proposal for inclusion
in the proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting may do so by following the procedures in Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange Act. To be eligible for inclusion in Monmouth’s proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting, shareholder
proposals must be received at Monmouth’s principal executive offices by July 18, 2022 (unless the date of the 2022
annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the date of Monmouth’s 2021 annual meeting of shareholders,
in which case the deadline is a reasonable time before Monmouth begins to print and send its proxy materials for its
2022 annual meeting of shareholders). Under Monmouth’s current bylaws, nominations of individuals for election to
Monmouth’s board of directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by Monmouth’s shareholders at
its 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, but not included in Monmouth’s proxy statement, may be made by a person
who is a shareholder of record at the time of giving notice and at the time of such meeting, who delivers notice along
with the additional information and materials required by Monmouth’s current bylaws to Monmouth’s secretary at its
principal executive offices not earlier than July 18, 2022 and not later than August 17, 2022. However, in the event that
the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders is advanced more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from the
first anniversary of the date of the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must
be received no earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of the mailing of the notice for such annual meeting and not
later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of the mailing of the notice for such
annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the mailing of the
notice of such meeting is first made.

Pursuant to rules of the SEC, a company may deliver to multiple shareholders sharing the same address a single copy
of its proxy materials unless the company has received prior instructions to the contrary. This procedure is referred to
as householding. Each shareholder subject to householding that receives printed proxy materials will continue to
receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. Upon written or oral request, Monmouth will promptly mail a
separate copy of the proxy statement in separate envelopes to any shareholder at a shared address to which a single
copy of the proxy statement was delivered in a single envelope. Conversely, upon written or oral request, Monmouth
will cease delivering separate copies of the proxy statement in separate envelopes to any shareholder at a shared
address to which multiple copies of such proxy materials were delivered in the past. If you received a single set of
these documents, but you would prefer to receive your own copy, you may direct requests for separate copies to
Monmouth’s proxy solicitor, MacKenzie Partners, at the following address and telephone number: 1407 Broadway,
27th Floor, New York, NY 10018, or call (800) 322-2885. If you are a shareholder who receives multiple copies of
Monmouth’s proxy materials, you may request householding by contacting Monmouth’s investor relations
department or Monmouth’s proxy advisor in the same manner and requesting a householding consent form.

Maryland corporation (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the
“Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Industrial Logistics Properties Trust, a Maryland
real estate investment trust (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”),
among the Company, the Acquiror and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (“Merger Sub”), the Company will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other
than shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub, will be converted into
the right to receive $21.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated November 3, 2021 of the Agreement; (ii)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in
which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial
terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management of the Company
relating to its business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other
information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We
have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that
the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also
assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, the Acquiror and Merger Sub in the
Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are
not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with
respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or
B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any
adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion
and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock
in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection
with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company
or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion
with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the
Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company
Common Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee
from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed
Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. Please be advised that during the two years preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor our
affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking
relationships with the Company, or any material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking
relationships with the Acquiror or RMR Group, a controlling affiliate of the Acquiror. In addition, we and our affiliates
hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and the
Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or the
Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or
short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid
to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This
letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the
purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This
opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose
whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information
statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without
our prior written approval.
Very truly yours,
J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the

direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United

banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 and, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent and shall be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash
in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount sufficient to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.
(c) Promptly, and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days, following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to provide to each Person that is a holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
as of the Effective Time (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Company Common Shares or

effectiveness of the Merger, which notice shall include: (i) appropriate transmittal materials (including a
customary letter of transmittal) specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
applicable Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 2.1(e)) or the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent (which is deemed to have been effected upon the delivery of a customary “agent’s message” with
respect to such Book-Entry Shares or such other evidence
A-4TABLE OF CONTENTS
reasonably acceptable to Parent or the Paying Agent, if any, of such surrender), as applicable; and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as
provided in Section 2.1(e)) or the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in exchange for the Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, that such holder is entitled to receive as a
result of the Merger. All such materials contemplated by this Section 2.1(c) shall be consistent with the terms of
this Agreement and shall otherwise be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.
(d) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of (i) Company Common Shares or Company Preferred Shares that are
represented by Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in Section 2.1(e)) together with the above-described letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent
in accordance with the terms of the materials and instructions provided by the Paying Agent and (ii) Company
Common Shares or Company Preferred Shares that are Book-Entry Shares, by book-receipt of an “agent’s
message” by the Paying Agent in connection with the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares (or such other
evidence, if any, of surrender with respect to such Book-Entry Shares), in each case, pursuant to such materials
and instructions as contemplated by Section 2.1(c), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly
as reasonably practicable to such holders, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company
Common Shares pursuant to Section 1.6(b) or the Preferred Stock Consideration payable in respect of such
Company Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 1.6(e), as applicable, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If delivery of the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock
Consideration is to be made to a Person holding a Certificate other than the Person in whose name a surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of delivery that the Certificate so surrendered must be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person who surrenders the Certificate must provide
funds for payment of any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of delivery of the Merger Consideration or
the Preferred Stock Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Entity and the Paying Agent that all Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.
(e) If a Certificate or a certificate representing Company Preferred Shares has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent and the Surviving Entity will cause the Paying Agent to accept an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed instead of the Certificate; provided that the Surviving
Entity may require the Person to whom any Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration is paid, as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, to give the Surviving Entity a bond in such reasonable amount as it
may direct or otherwise indemnify the Surviving Entity in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Entity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
(f) On or promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event not later than the later of (i) the first payroll date
after the Effective Time or (ii) three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent and/or the Surviving
Entity shall pay through their payroll systems (or deliver through an alternative method) the cash payments
described in Section 1.7(a) to the holders of Options and Restricted Stock Awards; provided, however, that in
the case of any amounts that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code,
Parent and/or the Surviving Entity shall pay such amounts in a manner and at the earliest possible time that will
not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.
(g) At any time which is more than one (1) year after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it or its designee any portion of the Payment Fund that had been deposited with the

Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company) shall not be deemed to be or
constitute a Recommendation Withdrawal.
(h) For purposes of this Agreement:
“Intervening Event” means an event, development or change in circumstances material to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not known to the Company Board (or if known, the material
consequences of which were not known by the Company Board) as of or prior to the execution of this
Agreement, which becomes known to the Company Board after the date of this Agreement, but prior to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote; provided, however, that the following shall not constitute, or be
considered in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of a
Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (ii) any change in the price of the
Company Common Shares or the Company Preferred Shares, in and of itself, or (iii) the fact that the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates or expectations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries’ consolidated revenue, earnings or other financial performance or
results of operations for any period, in and of itself (provided, however, that the underlying causes of such
change or fact shall not be excluded by clauses (ii) and (iii)).
“Takeover Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series of transactions, (i) any direct or indirect purchase or
other acquisition by any Person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) of shares of Company Common
Stock representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the Company Common Stock outstanding after giving
effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or
exchange offer by any Person that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such Person
beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%) of the Company Common Stock outstanding after giving
effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange offer; (ii) any direct or indirect purchase or other
acquisition by any Person of assets (including any equity securities of any Company Subsidiary) that constitute
more than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such purchase or acquisition); or
(iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving the Company as a result of which the holders of the Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction would cease to hold at least eighty percent (80%) of
the total voting power of the Company or any surviving entity (or any direct or indirect parent company thereof)
immediately following such transaction.
“Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, written, unsolicited Takeover Proposal (with all references to “20%” or
80% in the definition of Takeover Proposal being deemed to be references to “50%”) that (i) is on terms that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consulting with the Company Financial Advisors and outside
legal counsel), taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the Takeover
Proposal and the Person making the Takeover Proposal that the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
deems relevant, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the
transactions contemplated hereby (taking into account any amendments to which Parent has committed in
writing pursuant to Section 6.3(e)) and (ii) is determined by the Company Board to be reasonably likely of being
consummated.

to any circumstances, developments or matters in existence at or prior to the Effective Time, or acts or omissions

or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate, the advancement of expenses, exculpation and indemnification

hereof (the “D&O Insurance”) shall have lapsed prior to the Effective Time or its runoff coverage under the

Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to procure and maintain, for a period of not less than six (6) years after
the Effective Time, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies of at least the same coverage and amounts

premiums in the aggregate of more than an amount equal to 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the

Insurance shall have lapsed prior to the Effective Time or its runoff coverage under the D&O Insurance
otherwise would not survive for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time), prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or the Company shall have the option to cause coverage to be extended under the
Company’s D&O Insurance by obtaining a six-year “tail” policy or policies on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the Company’s existing D&O Insurance, subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos
above in this Section 6.8(f), and such “tail” policy or policies shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.8(f).
(g) This Section 6.8 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified
Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Entity. Each Indemnified
Party shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.8, and, following the Effective Time, shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained in this Section 6.8. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.8 that is denied by Parent and/or the Surviving
Entity, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such
indemnification or advancement of expenses, then Parent or the Surviving Entity shall pay such Indemnified
Party’s costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing
such claim against Parent and/or the Surviving Entity. The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section

all taxable periods of the Company commencing with the Company’s taxable year that ended on September 30,
2017, (i) the Company has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and

the date of consummation of such transaction, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent (or its
designees) the Company Termination Fee (less any amount paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to Section
8.3(f)) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. For
purposes of this Section 8.3(a), each reference to “20%” or “80%” in the definition of “Takeover Proposal” shall
be deemed to be a reference to “50%”.
(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), then, prior to

to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent.
(d) The parties agree and understand that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if
Parent receives the Company Termination Fee from the Company when such Company Termination Fee is due
pursuant to this Section 8.3, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, the “Company Related
Parties”) and none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or

other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or
any other Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, the Merger or any matters forming the basis for
such termination; provided that the foregoing shall not limit the obligations of the Company set forth in the last
sentence of this Section 8.3(d). For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a
grant of specific performance (solely in accordance with Section 9.12) and the payment of the Company
Termination Fee (solely in accordance with this Section 8.3) or monetary damages, under no circumstances shall
Parent and Merger Sub be entitled
A-47TABLE OF CONTENTS
to receive both a grant of specific performance requiring the Company to consummate the Merger and any
money damages, including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee, and while the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance and the payment of monetary damages, under no circumstances
shall the Company be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance requiring the Parent and Merger to
consummate the Merger and any money damages. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 do
not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay any amount that may become due pursuant to this Section
8.3 within the time periods specified in this Section 8.3, the Company shall pay the reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses of outside
counsel) incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit,
taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the
date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (including Section 8.3(d)), nothing
herein shall relieve any party from any liability or damages resulting from any fraud or any willful and material
breach of this Agreement.
(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), the
Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent no later than two (2) Business Days after submission of reasonable documentation
therefor, for all of their out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment banking firms and other financial advisors, lenders, experts and consultants) actually
incurred or accrued in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000.
(g) If the Company becomes obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee under this Section 8.3, then, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Company
Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by the Company that is reasonably acceptable to Parent
pursuant to a written escrow agreement (the “Company Termination Fee Escrow Agreement”) reflecting the
terms set forth in this Section 8.3(g) and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the escrow agent. The Company
Termination Fee Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Company Termination Fee in escrow or the applicable
portion thereof shall be released to Parent on an annual basis based upon the delivery by Parent to the escrow
agent of any one (or a combination) of the following: (i) a letter from Parent’s independent certified public
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing
Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable taxable year of
Parent determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)
(A)-(I) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (such income, “Qualifying REIT Income”), in which case the escrow agent
shall release to Parent such maximum amount stated in the accountant’s letter; (ii) a letter from Parent’s counsel
indicating that Parent received a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent of the
Company Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall
release to Parent the remainder of the Company Termination Fee; or (iii) a letter from Parent’s counsel indicating
that Parent has received a tax opinion from its outside counsel or accountant, respectively, to the effect that the
receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release to Parent the remainder of the Company Termination Fee. The Company Termination
Fee Escrow Agreement shall further provide that, at the end of the third calendar year beginning after the date
on which the Company’s obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee arose (or earlier if directed by Parent),
any remaining amount then being held in escrow by the escrow agent shall be disbursed to the Company. The
parties agree to cooperate in good faith to amend this Section 8.3(g) at the reasonable request of Parent in order
to (A) maximize the portion of the applicable Company Termination Fee that may be distributed to Parent
hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B)
improve Parent’s chances of securing the favorable private letter ruling from the

counsel or accountant described in this Section 8.3(g). The Company Termination Fee Escrow Agreement shall
provide that Parent shall bear all costs and expenses under the Company Termination Fee Escrow Agreement.
The Company shall not be a party to the Company Termination Fee Escrow Agreement and shall not bear any
liability, cost or expense resulting directly or indirectly from the Company Termination Fee Escrow Agreement
