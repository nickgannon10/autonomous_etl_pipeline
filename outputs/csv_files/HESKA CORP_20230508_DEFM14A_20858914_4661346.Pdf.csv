1TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Special Meeting of Heska’s Stockholders (See page 25)
A special meeting of Heska stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) will be held virtually at
meetnow.global/MH9Q2TS, on June 7, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., MDT. The Special Meeting is being held to consider and
vote on the following proposals:
•
to vote on a proposal to adopt and approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 31, 2023
(as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with its terms, the “Merger
Agreement”), by and among Heska, Acquiror, Merger Sub, and, solely for purposes of Section 9.15 of the
Merger Agreement, Mars, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, at the closing of the merger (the “Closing”), Merger Sub will merge with and into
Heska, with Heska surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror (the “Merger” and such proposal,
the “Merger Proposal”);
•
to vote on a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to Heska’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger
(the “Advisory Compensation Proposal”); and
•
to vote on a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies if a quorum is not present or there are not sufficient votes cast at the Special Meeting to
approve the Merger Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”).
Completion of the Merger is conditioned on, among other things, the approval of the Merger Proposal by the
requisite holders of Common Stock (“Heska stockholders”). Approval of the Adjournment Proposal and the
Advisory Compensation Proposal are not conditions to the obligation of the parties to complete the Merger.
Only holders of record of outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on May 2, 2023 (the
“Record Date”) are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote virtually at, the Special Meeting and any adjournment or
postponement of the Special Meeting unless a new record date is fixed in connection with any adjournment or
postponement of the Special Meeting. Heska stockholders may cast one vote for each share of Common Stock
owned as of the close of business on the Record Date for each proposal.
As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 10,913,754 shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, a Heska
stockholder’s abstention from voting or the failure of a Heska stockholder to vote (including the failure of a Heska
stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to give any voting
instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal.
Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Heska (the “Bylaws”), if a quorum is present at the Special
Meeting, approval of the Adjournment Proposal and the Advisory Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented
by proxy at the Special Meeting. Under the Bylaws, for purposes of determining whether shares are present and
entitled to vote with respect to any particular subject matter, abstentions and nonvotes with respect to such subject
matter will be treated as not present or entitled to vote on such subject matter, but will be treated as present and
entitled to vote for all other purposes. Accordingly, with respect to a Heska stockholder who is present in person or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and who abstains from voting on either the Advisory Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, such stockholder’s abstention will not be counted in connection with the
determination of whether a quorum is present with respect to such proposal and will have no effect on the outcome
of such proposal. The failure of a Heska stockholder of record who is not present in person or represented by proxy
at the Special Meeting to vote on either proposal, as well as the failure of a Heska stockholder who holds shares in
“street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to give any voting instructions to the bank, broker, trust
or other nominee, will have no effect on the outcome of either the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Merger and the Merger Agreement (See page 66)
You are being asked to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Closing, Merger Sub will merge with and into Heska, with Heska surviving
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror. The terms and conditions of the Merger are contained in the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. You are encouraged to read the Merger
Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the primary legal document that governs the Merger. Following the
Merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ, will be deregistered under Section 14(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”) and will cease to be publicly traded.
When the Merger is Expected to be Completed (See page 20) 
Heska and Mars are working to be in a position to complete the Merger as quickly as possible after the Special
Meeting. Heska currently anticipates that the Merger will be completed in the second half of 2023. In order to
complete the Merger, Heska must obtain the required Heska stockholder approval and approval under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the “HSR Act”),
certain other regulatory approvals and a number of other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement must be
satisfied or waived. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to Consummation of the Merger.”
Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Merger will be completed at all, or if completed, that it will be
completed in the second half of 2023.
Merger Consideration (See page 68)
At the time the Merger becomes effective (the “Effective Time”), each share of Common Stock, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock held by Heska as treasury
stock, shares held, directly or indirectly, by Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub, or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Heska,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shares of Restricted Stock (as defined below, the treatment of which is
described elsewhere in this proxy statement) or shares held by a holder who properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law), will
be converted into the right to receive $120.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding taxes (the “Merger Consideration”). Any shares of Common Stock held by Heska as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and retired and not be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration, and any shares of Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Mars, Acquiror or Merger
Sub, or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Heska, immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding and
will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Voting Agreements (See page 85)
Contemporaneously and in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Acquiror entered into a
voting agreement (each, a “Voting Agreement”) (the form of which is attached as Annex B to the accompanying
proxy statement) with each of (1) Kevin S. Wilson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Heska, and certain
Heska stockholders related to or affiliated with Mr. Wilson (such stockholders are referred to herein collectively as
the “Wilson Stockholders”), pursuant to which the Wilson Stockholders agreed, among other things, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to vote 482,578 of the shares of Common Stock, representing 4.42% of Common Stock
outstanding as of the Record Date, held by the Wilson Stockholders as of such date in favor of the Merger Proposal
at the Special Meeting, and (2) David E. Sveen, Ph.D., a member of the Heska board of directors (the “Heska Board”),
and certain Heska stockholders affiliated with Dr. Sveen (such stockholders are referred to herein collectively as the
“Sveen Stockholders”), pursuant to which the Sveen Stockholders agreed, among other things, subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, to vote 43,081 of the shares of Common Stock, representing 0.39% of Common Stock
outstanding as of the Record Date, held by the Sveen Stockholders as of such date in favor of the Merger Proposal
at the Special Meeting. For more information, please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Voting
Agreements.” For more information regarding the security ownership of the Wilson Stockholders and Sveen

Opinions of Financial Advisors to Heska (See page 41)
Heska retained each of BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofA Securities”) and Piper Sandler & Co. (“Piper Sandler”) to act
as financial advisors to the Heska Board in connection with the proposed Merger. At the meeting of the Heska Board
on March 31, 2023, BofA Securities and Piper Sandler each rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
writing, that as of such date, and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in their
respective opinions, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock (other than holders of
shares of Restricted Stock, shares owned (or held in treasury) by Heska, shares owned by any of Heska’s wholly-
owned subsidiaries, Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub (or any other subsidiary of Mars) or shares for which a holder
properly perfects its appraisal rights under the DGCL) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. The full texts of the written opinions of BofA Securities, dated March 31, 2023, and of
Piper Sandler, dated March 31, 2023, which set forth, among other things, the various assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by each of

opinions of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full texts
of the respective opinions. BofA Securities’s and Piper Sandler’s opinion were each rendered for the benefit of the
Heska Board, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of
such opinion, of the Merger Consideration to such holders of Common Stock. BofA Securities’s and Piper Sandler’s
opinions did not address any other aspects or implications of the Merger, including the relative merits of the Merger
as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or the fairness of the amount or
nature of the compensation to any officers, directors or employees of Heska, or any class of such persons, relative to
the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. BofA Securities and Piper Sandler did not express any opinion or recommendation as to how the Heska
stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.
Interests of Heska’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (See page 57)
In considering the recommendation of the Heska Board, that Heska stockholders vote to approve the Merger
Proposal, Heska stockholders should be aware that Heska’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Heska stockholders generally. These interests
include, among others:
•
the treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and RSUs (each, as defined below) held by directors and
executive officers and the treatment of purchase rights under the Heska Corporation 2020 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), in each case, under the Merger Agreement. For more information, see the
section entitled “Summary - Treatment of Heska Incentive Awards”;
•
Heska’s executive officers have arrangements with Heska that provide for certain bonuses upon the
completion of the Merger, including pro-rata target bonuses under Heska’s Management Incentive Plan
(the “MIP”) and certain deal bonuses;
•
Heska’s executive officers have arrangements with Heska that provide for certain severance payments or
benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following the completion of the Merger;
and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Heska’s executive officers and directors have rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that will survive the completion of the Merger.
The Heska Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and
approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending the approval of the Merger Proposal and the
Advisory Compensation Proposal to the Heska stockholders. See the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of
Heska’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested and whether subject to service-
based or performance-based vesting conditions), by virtue of the Merger, will be deemed fully vested (including with
respect to any performance-based vesting requirements), will cease to be outstanding and will be converted into the
right to receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the per share
Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of Common Stock of the Option, subject to tax withholding.

deemed vested at the greater of target or actual level of performance), will cease to be outstanding and will be
converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, an amount in cash equal
to the per share Merger Consideration, subject to tax withholding. For more information, see the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement - Treatment of Heska Incentive Awards - Treatment of RSUs.”

Time: (i) no new offering period under the ESPP will commence following March 31, 2023, (ii) there will be no increase
in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP and no contributions other than previously

otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger. However, the right to terminate
the Merger Agreement pursuant to this bullet will not be available to any party (i) that fails to comply
in all material respects with its regulatory efforts covenants under the Merger Agreement to contest,
appeal and remove such Legal Restraint or (ii) if the issuance of the Legal Restraint or the occurrence
of any such other action was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations
under the Merger Agreement (which failure constitutes a material breach of the Merger Agreement);

Expenses (See page 83)
Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such expenses.
Termination Fee (See page 82)
If the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay or cause
to be paid to Acquiror a termination fee of $45,000,000 (the “Termination Fee”). Acquiror would be entitled to receive
the Termination Fee from Heska if the Merger Agreement is terminated:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
under certain specified circumstances (as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement -
Termination Fee” beginning on page 82), including if within 12 months of such termination, Heska
consummates or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal for more than
50% of Common Stock or consolidated assets, or assets from which 50% or more of the consolidated
revenues or earnings of Heska are derived.
These triggers for the termination fee are subject to additional conditions or qualifications, which are described
in greater detail in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fee” beginning on page 82.
Reverse Termination Fee (See page 83)
If the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, Acquiror will be required to pay or cause to
be paid to Heska a termination fee of $60,000,000 (the “Reverse Termination Fee”). Heska would be entitled to receive
the Reverse Termination Fee from Acquiror if either Acquiror or Heska terminates the Merger Agreement:
•
because of a failure of the Closing to occur by the Outside Date, Extended Outside Date or Further
Extended Outside Date, as applicable, and at such time any of the closing conditions related to (i) the
absence of a Legal Restraint (solely as a result of a Legal Restraint in respect of an antitrust law issued or
entered after the date of the Merger Agreement), ​(ii) the expiration of the HSR waiting period and the
receipt of the clearances or approvals under applicable antitrust laws in the jurisdictions set forth on the
specified section of the disclosure schedule delivered by Heska to Acquiror immediately prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Schedule”) and (iii) the absence of a
Burdensome Condition have not been fulfilled (or waived to the extent permissible under applicable law)
but all other closing conditions either have been waived or fulfilled or would be fulfilled if the closing of the
Merger were to occur on such date; or
•
​because any Legal Restraint in respect of an antitrust law issued or entered after the date of the Merger
Agreement has become final and non-appealable that permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits
or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger.
These triggers for the Reverse Termination Fee are subject to additional conditions or qualifications, which are
described in greater detail in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Reverse Termination Fee” beginning on
page 83.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations (See page 62)
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations”) in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who
receives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the Merger and (ii) the U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock exchanged therefor.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the
Merger. No information is provided with respect to the tax consequences of the Merger under any U.S. federal law
other than income tax laws (including, for example the U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare and alternative minimum
tax laws), or any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. Consequently, holders of Common Stock should consult
their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the Merger relevant to their particular circumstances, including
the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of
changes in those laws.
Regulatory Matters (See page 64)
The completion of the Merger is subject to:
•
any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof, including under any agreement between a party
and a governmental authority agreeing not to consummate the Merger prior to a certain date) under the
HSR Act relating to the consummation of the Merger having expired or been terminated;
10
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
each other clearance or approval under any antitrust law in the jurisdiction set forth in the specified section
of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall have been obtained (or deemed obtained) or their respective
authority concluded no jurisdiction; and
•
(i) no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has entered any order that remains in effect and no
law has been adopted or is effective, in each case, that temporarily or permanently prohibits, enjoins or
makes illegal the consummation of the Merger or (ii) no legal proceeding has been brought by a
governmental authority that remains pending and that seeks an order that would impose a Legal Restraint.
Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until
required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(“Antitrust Division”) and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and statutory waiting period requirements have
been satisfied. On April 14, 2023, both Heska and Acquiror filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with
the Antitrust Division and the FTC. The waiting period under the HSR Act is expected to expire on May 15, 2023
unless earlier terminated or extended by the issuance of a request for additional information and documentary
material (a “Second Request”) to the parties by the FTC or the Antitrust Division prior to that time. If the FTC or the
Antitrust Division issues a Second Request, the waiting period with respect to the Merger will be extended for an
additional period of 30 calendar days following both parties’ substantial compliance with that request unless earlier
terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division. After that time, the waiting period may be extended only by court
order or with the consent of the parties. At any time before or after the consummation of any such transactions, the
FTC or the Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws of the United States as it deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the Merger.
Beneficial Ownership (See page 86)
At the close of business on the Record Date, Heska’s directors and executive officers and their affiliates, as a
group, beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately 990,307 shares of Common Stock, collectively
representing approximately 9.1% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on that date. Heska currently expects
that all of its directors and executive officers will vote their shares “ FOR ” the Merger Proposal, “ FOR ” the
Advisory Compensation Proposal and “ FOR ” the Adjournment Proposal (if necessary). For more information
regarding the security ownership of Heska directors and executive officers, please see the section entitled “Certain
Beneficial Owners of Common Stock.”
Pursuant to the Voting Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, (x) the Wilson Stockholders
have agreed to vote 482,578 shares of Common Stock, representing 4.42% of Common Stock outstanding as of the
Record Date, and any shares of Common Stock acquired by the Wilson Stockholders after March 31, 2023 and (y) the
Sveen Stockholders have agreed to vote 43,081 shares of Common Stock, representing 0.39% of Common Stock
outstanding as of the Record Date, and any shares of Common Stock acquired by the Sveen Stockholders after
March 31, 2023, in each case, in favor of the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting. For a more complete discussion
of the Voting Agreements, please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Voting Agreements.”
Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration (See page 16)
Prior to the Effective Time, Heska will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Acquiror and
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the
delisting of the Common Stock from NASDAQ by Heska, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after such delisting.
Litigation Related to the Merger (See page 64)
As of the date of this proxy statement, no stockholder litigation related to the Merger Agreement has been
brought against Heska or any members of the Heska Board.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Appraisal Rights (See page 89)
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), a holder of Common Stock who does not vote in
favor of the Merger Proposal will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of its shares of Common Stock as
determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Court of Chancery”) if the Merger is
completed, but only if such stockholder strictly complies with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL
(“Section 262”). This appraisal amount could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration. Any
holder of Common Stock intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written demand for
an appraisal to us prior to the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting and must not vote or otherwise
submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the
DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The requirements of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are
summarized in this proxy statement, including Section 262, the text of which can be found in Annex E to this proxy
statement.
Market Price of the Common Stock 
The closing trading price of a share of Common Stock on the NASDAQ on March 31, 2023, the last trading day
prior to our announcement of Heska’s entry into the Merger Agreement, was $97.62 per share, representing a
premium of approximately 38% to Heska’s 60-day volume weighted average price on March 31, 2023 and a premium of
approximately 23% to the closing price on March 31, 2023. On May 5, 2023, which is the latest practicable trading day
before this proxy statement was printed, the closing price of a share of Common Stock on NASDAQ was $116.80. You
are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for the Common Stock in connection with voting your shares of
Common Stock.

HESKA CORP_20230508_DEFM14A_20858914_4661346.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER
The following questions and answers briefly address some commonly asked questions about the Special
Meeting and the Merger. They may not include all the information that is important to Heska stockholders. Heska
stockholders should carefully read this entire proxy statement, including the annexes and the other documents
referred to herein and incorporated by reference.
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
A:
You are receiving this proxy statement because Heska has agreed to be acquired pursuant to an all-cash merger
transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Heska, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Heska will continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror. The Merger
Agreement governs the terms of the Merger of Merger Sub and Heska and is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex A. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Heska
Board in favor of the Merger Proposal and the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting.
In order to complete the Merger, among other things, Heska stockholders must adopt the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL. This proxy statement, which you should carefully read in its entirety, contains
important information about the Special Meeting, the Merger and other matters.
Q:
What will happen in the Merger?
A:
The Merger Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the proposed Merger. Under the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Heska, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
cease and Heska will continue as the Surviving Corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror. The
Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. For a more complete discussion of the
proposed Merger, its effects and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, please see the
section entitled “The Merger.”
Q:
What are Heska stockholders being asked to vote on?
A:
Heska is holding the Special Meeting to vote on the Merger Proposal, pursuant to which each outstanding
share of Common Stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, other
than shares held in the treasury of Heska, shares held, directly or indirectly, by Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub,
or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Heska immediately prior to the Effective Time, or shares of Restricted Stock
(the treatment of which is described elsewhere in this proxy statement) or shares held by a holder that properly
perfects its appraisal rights under the DGCL. Heska stockholders will also be asked to approve the Advisory
Compensation Proposal (on a non-binding, advisory basis) and the Adjournment Proposal.
Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock that you own. The approval of
the Merger Proposal is a condition to the obligations of Mars and Heska to complete the Merger.
Q:
How important is my vote as a Heska stockholder?
A:
Your vote “FOR” each proposal presented at the Special Meeting is very important, and you are encouraged to
submit a proxy as soon as possible. The Merger cannot be completed without the approval of the Merger
Proposal by the Heska stockholders.
Q:
What constitutes a quorum, and what vote is required to approve each proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date must be
represented at the Special Meeting in person or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum. Under the Bylaws, for
purposes of determining whether shares are present and entitled to vote with respect to any particular subject
matter, abstentions and nonvotes with respect to such subject matter will be treated as not present or entitled to
vote on such subject matter, but will be treated as present and entitled to vote for all other
13TABLE OF CONTENTS
purposes. Virtual attendance by stockholders of record at the Special Meeting will constitute presence in person
for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.
Shares of beneficial owners who hold such shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other
nominee and who fail to give voting instructions to their bank, broker, trust or other nominee will not be counted
toward quorum. Beneficial owners who virtually attend the Special Meeting will not count toward a quorum
unless they instruct their shares or hold a legal proxy executed by their bank, broker, trust or other nominee.
If a quorum is present, approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, a Heska
stockholder’s abstention from voting or the failure of a Heska stockholder to vote (including the failure of a
Heska stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to give any
voting instructions to that bank, broker, trust or other nominee) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Merger Proposal.
If a quorum is present, approval of each of the Adjournment Proposal and the Advisory Compensation Proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock as of the Record Date entitled to
vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, with respect to
a Heska stockholder who is present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, such
stockholder’s abstention from voting on either the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal. Regardless of whether there is a quorum, the
chairman or any other person presiding over the Special Meeting as provided in the Bylaws or designated by
the Heska Board may adjourn the Special Meeting. In addition, the Special Meeting may be postponed by the
Heska Board in its discretion.
As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 10,913,754 shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding.
Q:
How can I attend the Special Meeting?
A:
Heska stockholders as of the Record Date may attend, vote and submit questions virtually at the Special
Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) by logging in at meetnow.global/MH9Q2TS. To log in,
Heska stockholders (or their authorized representatives) will need the control number provided on their proxy
card, voting instruction form or notice. If you are not a Heska stockholder or do not have a control number, you
may still access the meeting as a guest, but you will not be able to participate.
Q:
Are there any Heska stockholders who have already committed to voting in favor of any of the proposals at the
Special Meeting?
A: Yes. Contemporaneously and in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Acquiror entered into
a Voting Agreement (the form of which is attached as Annex B to the accompanying proxy statement) with each
of (1) the Wilson Stockholders, pursuant to which the Wilson Stockholders agreed, among other things, subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, to vote 482,578 shares of Common Stock , representing 4.42% of Common
Stock outstanding as of the Record Date , held by the Wilson Stockholders as of such date in favor of the
Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and (2) the Sveen Stockholders, pursuant to which the Sveen
Stockholders agreed, among other things, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to vote 43,081 shares of
Common Stock , representing 0.39% of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date , held by the Sveen
Stockholders as of such date in favor of the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting. For more information,
please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Voting Agreements.”
Q:
What will Heska stockholders receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
If the Merger is completed, shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time will automatically be
cancelled and converted into right to receive the Merger Consideration of $120.00 per share in cash without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, unless the holder of such shares properly perfects its
appraisal rights under the DGCL. Any shares of Common Stock held by Heska as treasury stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and retired and not be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration, and any shares of Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Mars,
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Acquiror or Merger Sub, or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Heska, immediately prior to the Effective Time will
remain outstanding and will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. You will not be
entitled to receive shares in the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror or Mars.
For more information regarding the Merger Consideration to be received by Heska stockholders if the Merger is
completed, please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Effect of the Merger on the Common
Stock.”
Q:
What will happen to the Options, Restricted Stock and RSUs that I hold?
A:
Treatment of Options. At the Effective Time, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested and whether subject to service-based or performance-
based vesting conditions), by virtue of the Merger, will be deemed fully vested (including with respect to any
performance-based vesting requirements), will cease to be outstanding and will be converted into the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the per share Merger
Consideration less the exercise price per share of Common Stock of the Option, subject to tax withholding. Any
Option with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the per share Merger Consideration will be
cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment. For more information, see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Treatment of Heska Incentive Awards - Treatment of Options.”
Treatment of Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of Restricted Stock that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, will be deemed fully vested (including with
respect to any performance-based vesting requirements, which will be deemed to be achieved at maximum
performance), will cease to be outstanding and will be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the per share Merger Consideration, subject to tax
withholding. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Heska Incentive Awards -
Treatment of Restricted Stock.”
Treatment of RSUs. At the Effective Time, each RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger, will be deemed fully vested (including with respect to performance-based vesting
requirements, but excluding certain Company performance-based RSUs that were granted in 2023, which will be
deemed vested at the greater of target or actual level of performance), will cease to be outstanding and will be
converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, an amount in cash
equal to the per share Merger Consideration, subject to tax withholding. For more information, see “The Merger
Agreement - Treatment of Heska Incentive Awards - Treatment of RSUs.”
Q:
Will I be able to continue participating in the ESPP?
A:
Prior to the Effective Time, Heska will take all actions necessary to provide that, contingent on the Effective
Time: (i) no new offering period under the ESPP will commence following March 31, 2023, (ii) there will be no
increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP and no contributions other
than previously elected payroll deductions during the current offering period from those in effect as of March
31, 2023, (iii) no individual will commence participation in the ESPP prior to the Effective Time, (iv) each purchase
right issued pursuant to the ESPP will be fully exercised on the earlier of (a) June 30, 2023 and (b) ten business
days prior to the Effective Time and (v) the ESPP will be terminated effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.
Q:
How does the Heska Board recommend that I vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
The Heska Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Advisory
Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. For additional information regarding the
recommendation of the Heska Board, please see the section entitled “The Merger - Recommendation of the
Heska Board and Its Reasons for the Merger.”
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
All holders of shares of Common Stock who held shares at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled
to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
thereof. Each such holder of Common Stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before
the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for each share of Common Stock that such
holder owned of record as of the close of business on the Record Date. Please see the section entitled “The
Special Meeting of Heska’s Stockholders - Voting at the Special Meeting” for instructions on how to vote your
shares without attending the Special Meeting.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares of such stockholder’s common stock at a
special or annual meeting is referred to as a proxy. The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares
of common stock is called a proxy card.
Q:
How many votes do I have for the Special Meeting?
A: Each Heska stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record as of the close of
business on the Record Date for each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 10,913,754 outstanding
shares of Common Stock.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
A:If the requisite Heska stockholders do not approve the Merger Proposal or if the Merger is not completed for
any other reason, Heska stockholders will not receive any Merger Consideration or other payment for their
shares of Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, Heska expects that its management will operate
Heska’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and Heska will remain an
independent public company, the Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ, the
Common Stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and Heska stockholders will continue to
own their shares of Common Stock and will continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as
they currently are with respect to ownership of Common Stock. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not
completed, Heska may be obligated to pay to Acquiror the Termination Fee. Please see the section of entitled
“The Merger Agreement - Termination Fee.”
Q:
What conditions must be satisfied to complete the Merger?
A:
In addition to the approval of the Merger Proposal, the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various
other conditions, including (i) the absence of a Legal Restraint, (ii) the expiration of the HSR waiting period and
the receipt of the clearances or approvals under applicable antitrust laws in the jurisdictions set forth on the
specified section of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii) the absence of a Burdensome Condition. For a
more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived (in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement) prior to the completion of the Merger, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement -
Conditions to Consummation of the Merger.”
Q:
What effects will the Merger have on Heska?
A:
Our Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, and is quoted on NASDAQ under the
symbol “HSKA.” As a result of the Merger, Heska will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror. Following the consummation of the Merger, our Common Stock will be
delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act and Heska will no longer be required to file
periodic reports with the SEC with respect to our Common Stock, in each case, in accordance with applicable law,
rules and regulations.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of our Common Stock prior to the
announcement of Heska’s entry into the Merger Agreement?
A:
The Merger Consideration of $120.00 per share in cash represents a premium of approximately 38% over the
Heska’s 60-day volume weighted average price ending as of March 31, 2023, the last trading day prior to our
announcement of Heska’s entry into the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately 23% over the
closing price of the Common Stock on such date.

A: A:The Special Meeting will be held virtually at meetnow.global/MH9Q2TS , on June 7 , 2023 at 9:00 a.m. , MDT.
Online access will begin at 8:30 a.m. , MDT, and Heska encourages its stockholders to access the meeting prior
to the start time, leaving ample time for check-in. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually, Heska
requests that you complete, sign, date and return your proxy in advance as described above so that your shares
will be represented and voted at the Special Meeting if you later decide not to or become unable to attend the
Special Meeting.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner of shares
held in “street name”?
A:
If your shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a broker, bank, trust or other
nominee, you must provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your
shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. Please note
that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Heska or by voting in
person at the Special Meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker,
bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
What if my shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by my bank, broker, trust or other nominee?
A:
Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee that are present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank,
trust or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares on how to vote on a particular
proposal and such broker, bank, trust or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on

TABLE OF CONTENTS
such proposal. Because brokers, banks, trusts and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary
voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting, if a beneficial
owner of shares of Common Stock held in “street name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank,
trust or other nominee with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
If you provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee on one or more of the proposals
but not on one or more of the other proposals, then your shares will not be treated as present or entitled to vote
for the purposes of determining a quorum on any proposal for which you fail to provide instructions, and will
not be voted on any such proposal, but will be treated as present and entitled to vote for the purposes of
determining a quorum, and will be voted on any proposal for which you provide instructions. To make sure that
your shares are voted with respect to each of the proposals, you should instruct your bank, broker, trust or
other nominee how you wish to vote your shares in accordance with the procedures provided by your bank,
broker, trust or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares.
The effect of not instructing your bank, broker, trust or other nominee how you wish to vote your shares on
any of the proposals will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and will not have any effect on
the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal or the Advisory Compensation Proposal.
If you instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares on some
proposals but not the Merger Proposal, the resulting broker non-vote will have the same effect as voting
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. 
If you instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares on some
proposals but not the Advisory Compensation Proposal, the resulting broker non-vote will not have any effect
on the outcome of Advisory Compensation Proposal.
If you instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares on some
proposals but not the Adjournment Proposal, the resulting broker non-vote will not have any effect on the
outcome of Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the Special Meeting?
A:
If you hold shares of Common Stock in “street name” and also directly in your name as a stockholder of record
or otherwise, or if you hold shares of Common Stock in more than one brokerage account, you may receive more
than one set of voting materials relating to the Special Meeting.
Record Holders. For shares held directly, please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card, or you may
submit your proxy by telephone or Internet as provided on each proxy card, or otherwise follow the voting
instructions provided in this proxy statement in order to ensure that all of your shares of Common Stock are
voted.
“Street Name” Holders. For shares held in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying
agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration. If your shares of Common Stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee as to what action, if
any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Do not send in your certificates now.
Q:
I do not know where my stock certificate is-how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares?
A:
If the Merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the Merger will
include the procedures that you must follow to receive the Merger Consideration, including, in the case of
holders of stock certificates, if you cannot locate your stock certificate(s). This will include an affidavit that you
will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificate(s). Heska may also require that you provide a
customary indemnity agreement to Heska in order to cover any potential loss.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of Common Stock voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your
shares of Common Stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the proxy card or the Internet or
telephone processes, you may specify whether your shares of Common Stock should be voted for or against, or
abstain from voting on, all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
Q:
How will my shares of Common Stock be voted if I return a blank proxy?
A:
If you sign, date and return your proxy card and do not indicate how you want your shares of Common Stock to
be voted, then your shares of Common Stock will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Advisory
Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
Can I change my vote of shares of Common Stock after I have submitted my proxy?
A:
Yes. Any stockholder of record as of the close of business on the Record Date giving a proxy has the right to
revoke it before the proxy is voted at the Special Meeting by:
•
subsequently submitting a new proxy, whether by submitting a new proxy card or by submitting a proxy via
the Internet or telephone, that is received by the deadline specified on the accompanying proxy card;
•
giving written notice of your revocation to Heska’s Corporate Secretary; or
•
attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting.
Your attendance at the Special Meeting will not revoke your proxy unless you give written notice of revocation
to Heska’s Corporate Secretary before your proxy is exercised or unless you vote your shares in person at the
Special Meeting. Execution or revocation of a proxy will not in any way affect your right to attend the Special
Meeting and vote. Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of
proxies should be addressed to:
Heska Corporation
Attn: Corporate Secretary
3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue
Loveland, Colorado 80538
For more information, please see the section entitled “The Special Meeting of Heska’s Stockholders -
Revocation of Proxies.”
Q:
If I hold my shares in “street name,” can I change my voting instructions after I have submitted voting
instructions to my bank, broker, trust or other nominee?
A:
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, trust or other nominee and you previously provided voting
instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your
bank, broker, trust or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting will be announced at the Special Meeting. In addition,
within four business days of the Special Meeting, Heska intends to file the final voting results of the Special
Meeting with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights?
A:
Yes. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, a stockholder who does not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal will be
entitled to seek appraisal of its shares if such stockholder takes certain actions and certain criteria are satisfied.
For more information, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” and Annex E of this proxy statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Do any of the officers or directors of Heska have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be in addition
to my interests as a Heska stockholder?
A:
A:Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Heska Board that Heska stockholders vote to approve the
Merger Proposal, Heska stockholders should be aware that Heska’s directors and executive officers may have
interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Heska stockholders generally.
The Heska Board was aware of these interests and considered, among other matters, in evaluating and
approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending the approval of the Merger Proposal
and the Advisory Compensation Proposal to Heska’s stockholders. See the section entitled “The Merger - 
Interests of Heska’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Q:
Why am I being asked to vote on the Advisory Compensation Proposal?
A:
SEC rules require Heska to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain payments that
will or may be made to Heska’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Approval of the
Advisory Compensation Proposal is not required to complete the Merger.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting. If you transfer your shares of Common Stock
after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your
right to vote at the Special Meeting.
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
A:
Heska and Mars are working to be in a position to complete the Merger as quickly as possible after the Special
Meeting. Heska currently anticipates that the Merger will be completed in the second half of 2023. In order to
complete the merger, we must obtain the required Heska stockholder approval, approval under the HSR Act and
certain other regulatory approvals, and a number of other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement must
be satisfied or waived. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Conditions to Consummation of the
Merger.” Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Merger will be completed at all, or if completed, that it
will be completed in the second half of 2023.
Q:
What are the United States federal income tax considerations of the Merger for Heska stockholders?
A: The receipt of cash by U.S. h olders (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger -  U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations”) in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. h older
who receives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the Merger and (ii)
the U.S. h older’s adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock exchanged therefor.   For a more detailed summary of
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the M erger, see the section entitled “The Merger - U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations” beginning on page 62 .
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the
Merger. No information is provided with respect to the tax consequences of the Merger under any U.S. federal
law other than income tax laws (including, for example the U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare and alternative
minimum tax laws), or any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. Consequently, holders of Common Stock
should consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the Merger relevant to their particular
circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-
U.S. or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.
Q:
What should I do now?
A:
You should read this proxy statement carefully and, in its entirety, including the annexes, and return your
completed, signed and dated proxy card by mail in the enclosed postage-paid envelope, or you may submit your
voting instructions by telephone or over the Internet as soon as possible so that your shares will be voted in
accordance with your instructions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more
stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance
notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of
the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of
common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you
may have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you
have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a
separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to
revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
Q:
Who will count the vote?
A: A representative of Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (“Computershare”) will tabulate the votes.
Q:
Who will solicit and bear the cost of soliciting votes for the Special Meeting?
A:
Heska will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials.
In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by
telephone or by electronic and facsimile transmission by our directors, officers and employees, who will not
receive any additional compensation for such solicitation activities. Heska has engaged Morrow Sodali to assist
in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. Heska may reimburse its transfer agent, brokerage firms and
other persons representing beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock for their expenses in forwarding
solicitation material to such beneficial owners.
Q:
Where can I find more information about Heska?
A: You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section entitled “ Where You Can
Find More Information ” beginning on page 95 .
Q:
Whom do I call if I have questions about the Special Meeting or the Merger?
A:
If you have more questions about the Special Meeting or the Merger or how to submit your proxy, or if you need
additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card or voting instructions, please contact
Investor Relations, at Heska’s principal executive offices at 3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue, Loveland, CO 80538.

The presence at the Special Meeting of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum with respect to a
proposal. As a result, with respect to any proposal, there must be a majority of all of our outstanding shares of
Common Stock represented by proxy or by stockholders present at the Special Meeting in order to have a quorum
with respect to such proposal. Virtual attendance by Heska stockholders of record at the Special Meeting will
constitute presence in person for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of
business at the Special Meeting. Shares of beneficial owners who hold such shares in “street name” through a bank,
broker, trust or other nominee and who fail to give voting instructions to their bank, broker, trust or other nominee on
any proposal will not be counted towards quorum for such proposal, but will be counted towards quorum for any
other proposals. Shares of beneficial owners who virtually attend the Special Meeting will not count towards a
quorum unless such beneficial owners instruct their shares or hold a legal proxy executed by their bank, broker, trust
or other nominee. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the Special Meeting.
Failure of a quorum to be represented at the Special Meeting may result in an adjournment of the Special
Meeting and may subject Heska to additional expense. Even if a quorum is present, the Special Meeting may also be
adjourned one or more times in order to provide more time to solicit additional proxies in favor of approval of the
Merger Proposal if sufficient votes are cast in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. In addition, the Special Meeting
may be postponed by the chairman or any other person presiding over the Special Meeting as designated by the
Heska Board or the Heska Board in its discretion.
Notice need not be given of any adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at
such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is
for more than 30 days, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting. If, after any adjournment, a new record date for Heska stockholders entitled to vote is
fixed for any adjourned meeting, the Heska Board must fix a record date for notice of any adjourned meeting in
accordance with the DGCL and provide a new notice of any adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled
to vote at the meeting. In addition, the Special Meeting could be postponed before it commences.
If the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed one or more times for the purpose of soliciting additional
votes, Heska stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to
the final vote on the proposals. If you submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone or submit a properly
executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists at the Special Meeting.

If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, with respect
to a Heska stockholder who is present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, such stockholder’s
abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal. Additionally, the failure
of a Heska stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to give
voting instructions to the bank, broker, trust or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, approval of the Adjournment Proposal and the Advisory
Compensation Proposal each require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Under
the Bylaws, for purposes of determining whether shares are present and entitled to vote with respect to any particular
subject matter, abstentions and nonvotes with respect to such subject matter will be treated as not

present or entitled to vote on such subject matter, but will be treated as present and entitled to vote for all other
purposes. Accordingly, with respect to a Heska stockholder who is present in person or represented by proxy at the
Special Meeting and abstains from voting on either the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal, such stockholder’s abstention will not be counted in connection with the determination of whether a
quorum is present with respect to such proposal, and will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal. The
failure of a Heska stockholder of record who is not present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
to vote on either the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, as well as the failure of a Heska
stockholder who holds shares in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to give any voting
instructions to the bank, broker, trust or other nominee with respect to either proposal, will have no effect on the
outcome of either proposal.
The Merger is conditioned on, among other things, the approval of the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting.
The Advisory Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are not conditioned on the approval of any
other proposal set forth in this proxy statement and are not conditions to the consummation of the Merger.
Pursuant to the Voting Agreements, (i) the Wilson Stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to vote 482,578 shares of Common Stock, representing 4.42% of Common Stock outstanding as of
the Record Date, held by the Wilson Stockholders as of such date in favor of the Merger Proposal at the Special
Meeting, and (ii) the Sveen Stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to vote 43,081
shares of Common Stock, representing 0.39% of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, held by the
Sveen Stockholders as of such date in favor of the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting. For a more complete

HESKA CORP_20230508_DEFM14A_20858914_4661346.Pdf,Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes,"Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from
voting. At the Special Meeting, abstention from voting on a proposal will be treated as not present or entitled to vote
on such proposal, but will be treated as present and entitled to vote for all other proposals. Abstaining from voting
will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal but will have no effect on the outcome of either
of the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including no instruction to abstain from voting) in an executed, duly
returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted in accordance with the Heska Board’s recommendation with
returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be voted in accordance with the Heska Board’s recommendation with
respect to each proposal and consequently will be voted “FOR” each of (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Advisory
Compensation Proposal, and (iii) the Adjournment Proposal.
Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee that are present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other
nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares on how to vote on a particular proposal and the
broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominee
holders of record do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals to be
presented at the Special Meeting, if a beneficial owner of shares of the Company’s common stock held in “street
name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to any of the
proposals, then those shares will not be present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. If you provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee on one or more of the
proposals but not on one or more of the other proposals, then your shares will not be treated as present or entitled to
vote for the purposes of determining a quorum on any proposal for which you fail to provide instructions, and will
not be voted on any such proposal, but will be treated as present and entitled to vote for the purposes of determining
a quorum and will be voted on any proposal for which you provide instructions.

determining whether a quorum exists.
For purposes of the Merger Proposal, a failure of record owners to vote, or a failure of beneficial owners to

HESKA CORP_20230508_DEFM14A_20858914_4661346.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
Heska’s senior management and the Heska Board regularly review Heska’s performance, strategy, competitive
position, opportunities and prospects in light of current business and economic environments and developments in
the veterinary industry generally and the veterinary diagnostics industry more specifically and the opportunities and
challenges facing participants in the industry. These reviews have included consideration by Heska’s senior
management and the Heska Board of potential strategic alternatives, including acquisitions, business combinations
and other strategic transactions.
From time to time, Heska’s senior officers have met with other industry participants, including Mars and certain
other strategic companies, which include the strategic companies that we refer to as Party A and Party B, to discuss
potential commercial and strategic transactions.
In mid-2021, representatives of Heska, including Kevin S. Wilson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of
Heska, and Party A engaged in exploratory discussions regarding a potential transaction between Heska by Party A,
including the likelihood that the parties would be able to obtain regulatory approvals required to complete any such
transaction. No proposal was made by Party A.
On December 5, 2022, Mr. Wilson went to Boston, Massachusetts to meet with Party B to discuss commercial
and strategic opportunities between Heska and Party B. During these discussions, representatives of Party B noted
the rationale for a possible strategic transaction between Party B and Heska, but no proposal was made by Party B.
On December 29, 2022, Mr. Wilson met with a representative of a financial sponsor, which we refer to as Party C.
During this meeting, Mr. Wilson and the representative of Party C discussed certain publicly available financial
information regarding Heska, but no proposal was made by Party C.
Also in December 2022 and in January 2023, Mr. Wilson and other representatives of Heska’s senior
management team held several discussions with representatives of Mars regarding possible commercial opportunities
between Heska and Mars.
On January 16, 2023, Mr. Wilson attended the VMX Veterinary Meeting & Expo in Orlando, Florida, during which
he met with representatives of Party A and separately received an initial introduction to certain members of the senior
management team of Mars. At VMX Veterinary Meeting & Expo, Mr. Wilson discussed commercial opportunities and
general market observations with the representatives of each of Party A and Mars. While Mr. Wilson and
representatives of Party A did not directly discuss a possible strategic transaction, Mr. Wilson indicated that as a
public company, Heska was always open to listen to any proposal regarding a transaction that was in the interest of
Heska stockholders.
On January 23, 2023, Heska and Mars executed a commercial non-disclosure agreement for purposes of their
ongoing commercial discussions (the “Commercial NDA”). Also on January 23, 2023, Mr. Wilson met with Loïc
Moutault, Global President, Mars Petcare, and Nefertiti Greene, President of Mars Science & Diagnostics, in advance
of the meeting scheduled between representatives of each of Heska and Mars the following day to preliminarily
discuss commercial opportunities between Heska and Mars. While Mr. Wilson and representatives of Mars did not
directly discuss a possible change of control transaction, Mr. Wilson indicated that as a public company, Heska was
always open to listen to any proposal regarding a transaction that was in the interest of Heska stockholders.
On January 24, 2023, Mr. Wilson, Anthony Providenti, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development of
Heska, and Steven M. Eyl, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer of Heska and President of Scil Animal
Care, met with Ms. Greene, Margaret Ma, Director, Corporate Development of Mars, and Giambattista Martano, Chief
Financial Officer of Mars Science & Diagnostics, in New York, New York to discuss potential
31TABLE OF CONTENTS
commercial opportunities between the companies. At this meeting, the representatives of Mars discussed the
strategic rationale for a potential business combination transaction between Mars and Heska. No proposal was made
during this discussion but the representatives of Mars suggested organizing a follow-up discussion in the coming
weeks.
On February 13, 2023, Catherine Grassman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Heska, had a
telephone call with Mr. Martano and Ms. Ma during which the representatives of Heska responded to certain
clarifying questions concerning Heska’s publicly available financial information. Following the call, Mr. Wilson
transmitted to Ms. Greene and Ms. Ma materials containing certain financial information of Heska, subject to the
Commercial NDA.
On February 20, 2023, Heska received a written proposal from Mars (referred to as the “February 20 Letter”) to
acquire Heska in an all-cash transaction at a price of $112.50 per share (representing approximately $1.36 billion in
equity value, on a fully diluted basis, as of the date of the February 20 Letter). The February 20 Letter noted that the
proposed transaction would not be subject to a financing condition and would be funded through a combination of
cash on hand and/or bank facilities accessible to Mars on short notice. Mars also indicated in the February 20 Letter
its desire to move quickly toward a definitive agreement with Heska and requested a four week exclusivity period.
Together with the February 20 Letter, Mars delivered an exclusivity agreement proposed to be entered into by Mars
and Heska as well as a list of high priority due diligence items.
On February 21, 2023, the Heska Board and representatives of Heska’s senior management met for dinner in
advance of the regularly scheduled Heska Board meeting the following day. At the dinner, Mr. Wilson shared with the
Heska Board the terms of the February 20 Letter and the directors discussed the possibility of engaging in a change
of control transaction with Mars.
On February 22, 2023, the Heska Board held a regular in-person meeting at which representatives of Heska’s
senior management were present to discuss, among other things, the February 20 Letter. Also attending the meeting
were representatives of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, Heska’s outside legal counsel (referred to as “Gibson Dunn”).
A representative of Gibson Dunn reviewed the directors’ fiduciary duties in the context of Mars’s outreach. The
directors and representatives of each of Heska’s senior management and Gibson Dunn then discussed Mars’s
historic acquisitions of public companies, its request for exclusivity, potential alternative buyers, and possible
transaction terms should the Heska Board determine to move forward with a negotiation with Mars. After discussion,
the Heska Board instructed management and Gibson Dunn to negotiate and enter into a confidentiality agreement
including a customary standstill provision with Mars to enable further discussions with Mars. The Heska Board also
directed management to engage financial advisors to assist the Heska Board in evaluating the financial terms of the
February 20 Letter. The Heska Board and management discussed the importance of obtaining financial advice from
investment banks that were sophisticated in the animal health sector and know Heska well, but also ensuring the
independence of such advisors. In that regard, the Heska Board and management discussed potentially engaging
Piper Sandler, who had done significant work with Heska in the past. The Heska Board considered the fact that two of
Mr. Wilson’s sons were employed by Piper Sandler and agreed that that fact would not present a disqualifying
conflict of interest but that it may be advisable to also engage a second financial advisor. Following the meeting,
representatives of Heska senior management contacted representatives of certain investment banking firms,
including each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler, leading investment banks with long-standing relationships with
Heska and significant experience in the animal health sector, to discuss their possible engagement in connection with
a potential change of control transaction with Mars. Heska subsequently engaged each of BofA Securities and Piper
Sandler to serve as co-financial advisors in connection with a potential change of control transaction.
On February 23, 2023, Mr. Wilson had a telephone call with Ms. Greene during which Mr. Wilson and Ms.
Greene discussed the strategic rationale for a possible change of control transaction. Mr. Wilson stated that
representatives of Gibson Dunn would contact representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, legal
counsel to Mars (referred to as “Skadden”), to negotiate the terms of a confidentiality agreement, but noted that
Heska would not be able to substantively respond to the February 20 Letter until the Heska Board had first had the
opportunity to discuss with its financial advisors.
On February 25, 2023, Mr. Providenti had a telephone call with Ms. Ma to further discuss the appointment of
Heska’s advisors and Heska’s proposed timeline for a substantive response to the February 20 Letter.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 27, 2023, representatives of Piper Sandler delivered to Heska senior management a letter regarding
Piper Sandler’s material investment banking relationships with Heska and Mars for the period from January 1, 2020 to
February 27, 2023, which letter disclosed no material investment banking relationships with Mars and disclosed the
fact that two of Mr. Wilson’s sons were employed by Piper Sandler but would not serve on the deal team for the
proposed transaction with Mars. Representatives of Heska senior management subsequently relayed the contents of
such letter to the Heska Board.
On February 28, 2023, Heska and Mars executed a confidentiality agreement that contained a customary
standstill provision and Mr. Providenti had a telephone call with Ms. Ma to discuss transaction process matters.
On March 2, 2023, representatives of BofA Securities delivered to Heska senior management a letter regarding
BofA Securities’ material investment banking relationships with Heska and Mars for the period from February 1, 2021
to January 31, 2023. Representatives of Heska senior management subsequently relayed the contents of such letter to
the Heska Board.
On March 3, 2023, the Heska Board held a special virtual meeting at which representatives of each of Heska’s
senior management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn were present. Heska’s senior management team
reviewed with the Heska Board the five-year forecasts for Heska prepared by Heska management, and the Heska
Board unanimously approved such forecasts, including for use by BofA Securities and Piper Sandler for purposes of
performing their respective financial analyses. Please see the section entitled “The Merger - Certain Unaudited
Forecasted Financial Information” beginning on page 39 for such forecasts. Representatives of each of BofA and
Piper Sandler then reviewed their respective preliminary financial analysis of Heska based on publicly available
information and certain strategic alternatives available to Heska, including a sale to other possible counterparties.
Representatives of each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler also reviewed certain other potential counterparties that
might be interested in a strategic transaction with Heska. The directors discussed whether to affirmatively reach out
to other possible counterparties regarding a potential strategic transaction but considered that it was unlikely that
another party would make an offer as attractive as the February 20 Letter, noting that none of Party A, Party B or
Party C (which parties included the strategic companies the Heska Board believed would be most likely to be
interested in a strategic transaction with Heska) had engaged in discussions regarding a potential change of control
transaction following their respective meetings with Mr. Wilson. The directors and representatives of each of senior
management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn discussed the February 20 Letter and Mars’s request
for exclusivity, and the Heska Board and Mr. Wilson discussed seeking a price in the range of $115 to $125 per share
in cash. The Heska Board directed Mr. Wilson to relay to Mars that the price in the February 20 Letter was not
sufficient and also suggested that Mr. Wilson indicate that the Heska Board may be willing to grant Mars’s request
for exclusivity in exchange for a “go shop” in the definitive transaction agreement.
On March 4, 2023, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Providenti had a video conference with Ms. Greene and Ms. Ma during
which they relayed that the price in the February 20 Letter was not sufficient but that the Heska Board may be open
to a revised offer in the $122.50 to $125 range. Mr. Wilson also stated that the Heska Board may be willing to enter
into an exclusivity agreement with Mars only if Heska was entitled to a “go shop” in the definitive transaction
agreement but that Heska would not otherwise agree to exclusivity. Ms. Greene indicated that Mars would consider
the Heska Board’s counteroffer and revert to Heska.
On March 6, 2023, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Providenti had a video conference with Ms. Ma and Ms. Greene to
further discuss the Heska Board’s counteroffer and Mars’s request for exclusivity. Later on March 6, 2023, Mars
submitted to Heska a revised written proposal (referred to as the “March 6 Letter”) to acquire Heska in an all-cash
transaction at a price of $120.00 per share (representing approximately $1.48 billion in equity value, on a fully diluted
basis, as of the date of the March 6 Letter) on terms otherwise substantially the same as the February 20 Letter.
Together with the March 6 Letter, Mars delivered a list of key due diligence topics and an exclusivity agreement
proposed to be entered into by Mars and Heska (which were identical to those delivered with the February 20 Letter).
On March 7, 2023, representatives of Gibson Dunn had a telephone call with representatives of Skadden to
clarify Mars’s request for exclusivity and reiterated Mr. Wilson’s earlier comment that Heska would only be willing to
agree to exclusivity in exchange for a “go shop” in the definitive transaction agreement.
Later on March 7, 2023, the Heska Board held a special virtual meeting at which representatives of each of
Heska’s senior management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn were present to discuss the
33

March 6 Letter. Representatives of each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler reviewed the financial terms of the
March 6 Letter, and the Heska Board and senior management noted that Mars had presented a strong offer. The
Heska Board thereafter authorized Heska senior management to move forward with the negotiation of a potential
change of control transaction with Mars on the basis of the March 6 Letter, including commencement of due
diligence and negotiation of definitive transaction documents. Heska and Mars did not enter into any exclusivity
arrangements that would have restricted Heska’s ability to pursue alternative strategies or transactions.
Later on March 8, 2023, Skadden delivered to Gibson Dunn the initial draft of the Merger Agreement for the
proposed transaction. The draft Merger Agreement contemplated, among other things, (i) a non-solicitation
provision applicable to Heska that would allow the Heska Board, under certain circumstances, to change its
recommendation in the event of a superior proposal or intervening event; (ii) a provision requiring the parties to the
Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory approvals, subject to certain
limitations, but no reverse termination fee or other remedy in the event the transaction did not close due to a failure to
obtain regulatory approval; (iii) a termination fee (with the amount left blank) payable by Heska under certain
circumstances; and (iv) a reference to voting agreements pursuant to which certain directors and/or members of
management would be required to vote their shares of Common Stock in favor of the Merger.
On March 9, 2023, Heska provided Mars and its advisors with access to an electronic due diligence data room.
On March 10, 2023, Heska and Mars executed a “clean team” addendum to the confidentiality agreement. Later that
day, Heska provided Mars and its advisors with access to a “clean team” due diligence data room. Thereafter, Mars
and its advisors conducted financial, accounting, tax, operational, legal and regulatory due diligence through late-
March 2023, including through several virtual and in person management meetings, site visits and due diligence calls.
On March 13, 2023, representatives of each of Heska’s senior management, Mars, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler,
Gibson Dunn, Lazard Frères & Co., financial advisor to Mars (referred to as “Lazard”), Ernst & Young, financial due
diligence advisor to Mars, and Skadden met in New York, New York for a management presentation during which
Heska’s management shared a presentation regarding Heska’s business, including a subset of the Forecasted
Financial Information.
On March 15, 2023, representatives of Gibson Dunn sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Skadden.
Among other things, the revised draft of the Merger Agreement (i) heightened the regulatory-efforts standard, (ii)
proposed an outside date of up to 18 months and (iii) included a remedies construct under which Acquiror would be
required to both pay a reverse termination fee and enter into a commercial arrangement with Heska if the Merger
Agreement was terminated due to failure to obtain regulatory approvals. Later on March 15, 2023, representatives of
Skadden sent an initial draft of a voting agreement to be executed by certain directors and members of management.
Over the next several days, representatives of each of Skadden and Gibson Dunn negotiated and exchanged markups
of such voting agreement.
On March 22, 2023, the board of directors of Mars reviewed the terms of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby.
On March 24, 2023, the Heska Board held a special virtual meeting at which representatives of each of Heska’s
senior management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn were present. The Heska Board received an
update regarding Mars’s due diligence investigation of Heska. Representatives of each of BofA Securities and Piper
Sandler reviewed with the Heska Board their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to Heska and the
Merger Consideration. Representatives of Gibson Dunn reminded the Heska Board of its fiduciary duties in
connection with the potential change of control transaction with Mars and provided the Heska Board with a summary
of the draft Merger Agreement and certain open points for negotiation therein, including, among other things, (i) the
regulatory construct, including the obligations on Acquiror to seek regulatory approvals and the limitations on such
obligations; (ii) the remedies for a failure to obtain regulatory approvals; and (iii) the potential size of the termination
fee payable by Heska under certain circumstances.
From the period beginning on March 24, 2023 through March 29, 2023, representatives of each of Skadden and
Gibson Dunn exchanged revised drafts of the Merger Agreement. The revised drafts did not address the size of the
termination fees or the regulatory construct. Late on March 29, 2023, Skadden sent a revised draft of the Merger
Agreement to Gibson Dunn that, among other things, (i) provided that no divestiture of any of Mars’s assets or
assets of Heska generating more than $30 million in revenue for fiscal year 2022 would be required to
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
obtain regulatory approvals; (ii) included a termination fee payable by Heska of 3.75% of Heska’s equity value under
certain customary circumstances; and (iii) removed Acquiror’s obligation to pay a reverse termination fee and enter
into a commercial arrangement with Heska if the Merger Agreement was terminated due to failure to obtain regulatory
approvals.
On March 30, 2023, Gibson Dunn sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Skadden that, among other
things (i) provided that no divestiture of Heska generating more than $30 million in revenues in the United States for
fiscal year 2022 would be required to obtain regulatory approvals; (ii) provided for a termination fee payable by Heska
of $30 million; and (iii) reinstated the remedies construct under which Acquiror would be required to both pay a
reverse termination fee of $100 million and enter into a commercial arrangement with Heska if the Merger Agreement
was terminated due to failure to obtain regulatory approvals. Together with the draft Merger Agreement,
representatives of Gibson Dunn sent to representatives of Skadden a draft term sheet for the proposed commercial
arrangement. Following transmission of the draft Merger Agreement to Skadden, Mr. Providenti had a telephone call
with Ms. Ma during which he stated that Heska was requesting the proposed reverse termination fee and commercial
arrangement remedy in connection with a failure to obtain required regulatory approvals and that, if this remedy was
rejected, the Heska Board would require greater per share cash consideration in exchange for bearing greater
regulatory risk. Ms. Ma rejected Mr. Providenti’s request to increase the per share cash consideration.
Later on March 30, 2023, Skadden sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Gibson
Dunn that provided, among other things, (i) that no divestiture of assets of Heska generating more than unspecified
amounts in revenues in each of the North American segment and in all other jurisdictions for fiscal year 2022 would
be required to obtain regulatory approvals; (ii) for a termination fee of $45 million payable by the Company under
certain circumstances; and (iii) for a reverse termination fee of $60 million payable by Acquiror if the Merger
Agreement was terminated due to failure to obtain regulatory approvals but that removed the proposed commercial
arrangement remedy.
On March 31, 2023, the Heska Board held a special virtual meeting at which representatives of each of Heska’s
senior management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson Dunn were present. Representatives of each of BofA
Securities and Piper Sandler reviewed with the Heska Board their respective financial analyses with respect to Heska
and the Merger Consideration. Representatives of Gibson Dunn provided the Heska Board with a summary of the
latest draft Merger Agreement, including, among other things, (i) the latest regulatory construct, including the
obligations on Acquiror to seek regulatory approvals and the limitations on such obligations; (ii) the $60 million
reverse termination fee payable by Acquiror due to a failure to obtain regulatory approvals; and (iii) the $45 million
termination fee payable by Heska under certain circumstances.
Throughout the day on March 31, 2023, representatives of each of Gibson Dunn and Skadden continued to
exchange drafts of and finalize the Merger Agreement, the disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement, the voting
agreements to be executed by Mr. Wilson and Dr. Sveen, a director on the Heska Board, and an amendment to a
purchase agreement previously executed by Heska and its subsidiary in connection with a previous acquisition
providing that, in the event the Merger is consummated, one of the earn-outs payable thereunder would be settled
for an accelerated cash payment at Closing and the other two earn-outs payable thereunder would be paid in cash in
lieu of Common Stock provided that the applicable earn-out targets were achieved in the future (the “Earnout
Amendment”).
Later in the day on March 31, 2023, the Heska Board reconvened the special virtual meeting. Also joining the
meeting were representatives of each of Heska’s senior management, BofA Securities, Piper Sandler and Gibson
Dunn. Representatives of each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler reviewed their respective financial analyses with
respect to the Merger Consideration that were presented at the earlier meeting and rendered their respective oral
opinions, subsequently confirmed by the delivery of written opinions, each dated March 31, 2023, that, as of the date
of such opinions, and based on and subject to the various assumptions and limitations described in their respective
opinions, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock (other than shares held in the
treasury of Heska, shares held, directly or indirectly, by Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub, or any wholly-owned
subsidiary of Heska immediately prior to the Effective Time, or shares of Restricted Stock or shares held by a holder
that perfects its appraisal rights under the DGCL) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders. Please see the section entitled “The Merger - Opinions of Financial Advisors to Heska”
beginning on page 41 for descriptions of each of BofA Securities’ and Piper Sandler’s respective opinions and
financial analyses. Representatives of Gibson Dunn provided the
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Heska Board with a summary of the draft Merger Agreement, including, among other things, the resolution of
Acquiror’s regulatory efforts obligations with the definition of Burdensome Condition (as defined below in the
section titled “The Merger Agreement-Other Covenants and Agreements-Efforts to Complete the Merger; Regulatory
Approvals”). Thereafter, the Heska Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of,
Heska and Heska’s stockholders, (ii) approved, authorized, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iii) resolved to recommend that
Heska’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For a description of the various factors considered by the Heska Board, see
the section entitled “The Merger-Recommendation of the Heska Board.”
Thereafter, on March 31, 2023, Heska, Mars, Acquiror and Merger Sub signed the Merger Agreement, Acquiror,
Mr. Wilson, Dr. Sveen and certain stockholders related to Mr. Wilson and Dr. Sveen executed the Voting Agreements
and Heska and the other parties thereto signed the Earnout Amendment. Prior to the opening of trading on NASDAQ
on April 3, 2023, Heska and Mars issued a joint press release announcing the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. Later on the same day, Heska filed a Current Reports on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing,
among other things, (i) the execution of the Merger Agreement and the Earnout Amendment and filing the joint press
release as an exhibit and (ii) summarizing the material terms of the Merger Agreement, Earnout Amendment and
Voting Agreements and filing the Merger Agreement, Earnout Amendment and form of Voting Agreement as exhibits.

HESKA CORP_20230508_DEFM14A_20858914_4661346.Pdf,Recommendation of Heska Board and Its Reasons for the Merger,"Recommendation of Heska Board and Its Reasons for the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Heska Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, yours. The Heska Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and
negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Proposal be approved by
the Heska stockholders. See the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Heska’s Directors and Officers in the
Merger” beginning on page 57.
By unanimous vote, the Heska Board, at a special meeting held on March 31, 2023 and after careful
considerations at this and prior Heska Board meetings, among other things:
•
determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Heska and the Heska stockholders;
•
approved, authorized, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and
•
resolved to recommend that the Heska stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Heska Board unanimously recommends that Heska stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, the Heska Board consulted with Heska’s senior management, outside legal counsel and financial
advisors. The Heska Board determined that entering into the Merger Agreement with Mars was advisable, fair to and
in the best interests of Heska and its stockholders. In arriving at this determination and in recommending that Heska
stockholders vote their shares of Common Stock in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Heska Board
considered a number of factors, including the following factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance) which
the Heska Board viewed as being generally positive or favorable in coming to its determination, approval and related
recommendation:
•
The fact that the all-cash Merger Consideration will provide Heska stockholders with immediate value, in
cash, for their shares of Common Stock, while avoiding the long-term business risk of retaining their shares
of Common Stock, and while also providing such stockholders with certainty of value for their shares of
Common Stock.
36TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
The Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented a premium of
approximately 38% to Heska’s 60-day volume weighted average price on March 31, 2023, the last trading
day prior to the public announcement by Heska and Mars of the Merger Agreement, and a premium of
approximately 23% to the closing price on March 31, 2023.
•
The benefits that Heska was able to obtain during its negotiations with Mars, including an increase in
Mars’s offer price per share from the beginning of the process to the end of the negotiations. The Heska
Board believed that the Merger Consideration reflected in the Merger Agreement represented Mars’s best
and final offer, and that there was no assurance that a more favorable opportunity to sell Heska would arise
later or through any alternative transaction.
•
The Heska Board’s understanding of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects
of Heska, including Heska’s prospects as an independent publicly traded entity and its standalone
operating plan.
•
The timing of the Merger and the risk that if Heska did not accept Mars’s offer, it may not have another
opportunity to do so or to pursue an opportunity offering at least as much value to Mars’s stockholders.
•
The oral opinions of each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler, which were subsequently confirmed by the
delivery of written opinions, dated March 31, 2023, to the effect that, as of such date, and based on and
subject to various assumptions and limitations described in their respective opinions, the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock (other than holders of shares of Restricted
Stock, shares owned (or held in treasury) by Heska, shares owned by any of Heska’s wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub (or any other subsidiary of Mars) or shares for which a holder
properly perfects its appraisal rights under the DGCL) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the heading “The Merger - 
Opinions of Financial Advisors to Heska.”
•
The Heska Board considered the terms of the Merger Agreement related to Heska’s ability to respond to
unsolicited acquisition proposals and determined that third parties would be unlikely to be deterred from
making a competing proposal by the provisions of the Merger Agreement, including because the Heska
Board may, under certain circumstances, furnish information or enter into discussions in connection with
an acquisition proposal if necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties. In this regard, the Heska Board
considered that:
•
subject to its compliance with the Merger Agreement and prior to the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the requisite Heska stockholders, the Heska Board may change its recommendation to
Heska stockholders with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement if, among other things, it
determines that such proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; and
•
while the Merger Agreement contains the Termination Fee that Heska would be required to pay to
Acquiror in certain circumstances, the Heska Board believed that the Termination Fee is reasonable in
light of such circumstances and the overall terms of the Merger Agreement, consistent with fees in
comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers. For further discussion regarding the
circumstances in which Heska would be required to pay the Termination Fee, please see the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fee” beginning on page 82.
•
The Heska Board’s belief that the Merger Agreement offered reasonable assurances as to the likelihood of
consummation of the Merger, including the likelihood that the Merger will receive all necessary regulatory
approvals without unacceptable conditions and that all conditions to consummation of the Merger will be
satisfied. To that end, the Heska Board further considered the potential length of the regulatory approvals
process and that the Merger Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it may not be
terminated until April 1, 2024, which may be extended for two additional three-month periods to September
30, 2024 under specified circumstances, together with the fact that Heska would be entitled to receive the
Reverse Termination Fee if the necessary regulatory approvals
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
have not been obtained by such date and the Merger Agreement is terminated. The Heska Board also
considered the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement and the fact that Mars was
guaranteeing Acquiror’s obligations under the Merger Agreement.
•
The fact that the Merger will be subject to the approval of Heska stockholders.
•
The fact that the Merger does not require the approval of Mars’s stockholders, with the attendant risks
associated with such a vote.
•
The support of the Merger by the Wilson Stockholders and the Sveen Stockholders, as evidenced by their
execution of the Voting Agreements.
•
The fact that Heska stockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and who follow certain
prescribed procedures would be entitled to seek appraisal under Delaware law.
•
The fact that the Heska Board reviewed, in consultation with Heska’s legal advisors, and considered that
the terms of the Merger Agreement, taken as a whole, including the parties’ representations, warranties and
covenants and the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement may be terminated, in its belief, are
reasonable. The Heska Board also reviewed and considered the limited number and nature of the
conditions to the completion of the Merger, including customary regulatory approvals.
The Heska Board also considered and balanced against the potentially positive factors a number of
uncertainties, risks and factors it deemed generally negative or unfavorable in making its determination, approval and
related recommendation, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
•
The fact that Heska stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of Heska and will not
benefit from any appreciation in value of Heska, including any appreciation in value that could be realized
as a result of improvements to Heska’s operations.
•
The diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic
opportunities while working to implement the Merger.
•
The fact that, while Heska had discussions with certain other potentially interested third party acquirors,
neither Heska nor its financial advisors publicly solicited proposals from potential acquirers or conducted a
full market check immediately prior to signing the Merger Agreement as a means of determining whether
there were other parties interested in acquiring, or entering into another strategic transaction with, Heska.
•
The potential negative effect of the pendency of the transaction on Heska’s business, including its
relationships with employees, customers and suppliers, and the restrictions on the conduct of Heska’s
business prior to completion of the Merger.
•
The risk that the Merger may not be completed despite the parties’ efforts or that completion of the Merger
may be unduly delayed, even if the requisite approval is obtained from Heska stockholders, including the
possibility that conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger may not be satisfied
(including the possibility that applicable regulatory approvals may not be obtained), and the potential
resulting disruptions to Heska’s business.
•
The fact that certain regulatory approvals are required to complete the Merger, and the risk that
governmental authorities may seek to impose unfavorable terms or conditions on the required regulatory
approvals or that those regulatory approvals may not be obtained at all.
•
The fact that, subject to certain limited exceptions, during the term of the Merger Agreement, Heska is
prohibited from soliciting any inquiry or proposal with respect to a competing proposal for Heska.
•
The possibility that the Termination Fee payable by Heska upon the termination of the Merger Agreement
under certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirers from making a competing
acquisition proposal to acquire Heska.
•
The fact that the parties have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses
in connection with the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
The fact that Heska’s directors and officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, those of Heska’s stockholders generally, as detailed in the section entitled “The Merger -
Interests of Heska’s Directors and Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 57.
•
The restrictions on the conduct of Heska’s business during the period between the execution of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, as described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement - Conduct of Business Pending the Merger” beginning on page 71.
•
The fact that the consideration received by Heska’s U.S. stockholders in the Merger will generally be
taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes as more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger - 
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” beginning on page 62.
•
The risks described under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Heska’s most recent filing on Form 10-K,
and the matters described under the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Information” beginning on page 22 .
The Heska Board considered all of these factors as a whole, as well as others, and, on balance, concluded that
the potential benefits of the Merger to Heska stockholders outweighed the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and
potentially negative factors associated with the Merger.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Heska Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but is
meant to include material factors considered by the Heska Board. The Heska Board collectively reached the
conclusion to approve the Merger Agreement in light of the various factors described above and other factors that
the members of the Heska Board believed were appropriate. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection
with its evaluation of the Merger, the Heska Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and recommendations.
Moreover, each member of the Heska Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and
may have given different weight to different factors. The Heska Board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its
ultimate determination. The Heska Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information available to it,
including discussions with Heska’s senior management and outside legal and financial advisors. It should be noted
that this explanation of the reasoning of the Heska Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-
looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Information” beginning on page 22. Accordingly, the Heska Board unanimously
recommends that Heska stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.

Heska does not, as a matter of course, make public long-term forecasts or internal projections as to future
performance, revenues, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying
assumptions and estimates. In connection with the process leading to the execution of the Merger Agreement, Heska
management prepared certain unaudited projections of future financial and operating performance of Heska for the
years 2023 through 2027, which we refer to as the “Forecasted Financial Information.” The Forecasted Financial
Information was provided by Heska management to the Heska Board and Heska’s financial advisors for their use and
reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and opinions (see the section entitled “The Merger -
Opinions of Financial Advisors to Heska” beginning on page 41).
The inclusion of this Forecasted Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that any of
Heska, its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this Forecasted
Financial Information considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future performance or
events, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and such summary projections set forth below should
not be relied on as such.
The Forecasted Financial Information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects.
While presented with numeric specificity, the Forecasted Financial Information reflects numerous estimates and
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of Heska’s management. Further, given that
the Forecasted Financial Information covers multiple years, by its nature, it becomes subject to greater uncertainty
with each successive year beyond its preparation. The Forecasted Financial Information is subject to various risks,
including, among others, the effect of future regulatory or legislative actions on Heska or
39TABLE OF CONTENTS
the industries in which it operates, the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the Merger on
relationships with customers, vendors, competitors, management and other employees, risks relating to Heska’s
indebtedness, changes in the general economic environment, or social or political conditions that could affect
Heska’s businesses, potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation, and other matters described in the
sections entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information,” and “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
The Forecasted Financial Information reflects both assumptions as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change and, in many respects, personal judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and
periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. Neither Heska nor its affiliates, officers,
directors, advisors or other representatives can give assurance that the Forecasted Financial Information and the
underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. This Forecasted Financial Information constitutes “forward-
looking statements” and actual results may differ materially and adversely from those set forth below.
The Forecasted Financial Information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after
the date it was prepared. Heska cannot give assurance that, had the Forecasted Financial Information that was
prepared by it been prepared either as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as of the date of this proxy statement,
similar estimates and assumptions would be used. The Forecasted Financial Information does not take into account
all of the possible financial and other effects of the Merger on Heska, the effect on Heska of any business or strategic
decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed, or the
effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement
had not been executed, but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the
Merger. Further, the Forecasted Financial Information does not take into account the effect on Heska of any possible
failure of the Merger to occur. Neither Heska nor any of its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other
representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation to any Heska stockholder
or other person regarding Heska’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Forecasted
Financial Information or that the Forecasted Financial Information will be achieved. The inclusion of the Forecasted
Financial Information herein should not be deemed an admission or representation by Heska, its affiliates, officers,
directors, advisors or other representatives or any other person that it is viewed as material information of Heska,
particularly in light of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such forecasts. The summary of the
Forecasted Financial Information included below is not being included in this proxy statement in order to influence
the decision of any Heska stockholder or to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of any of the proposals at the
Special Meeting.
The Forecasted Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial
information. The Forecasted Financial Information included in this proxy statement has been prepared at the direction
of, and is the responsibility of, management of Heska. Grant Thornton LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined,
compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Forecasted Financial Information and, accordingly,
Grant Thornton LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The Grant
Thornton LLP report contained in Heska’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates
to historical financial information of Heska, and such report does not extend to the Forecasted Financial Information
and should not be read to do so.
The Forecasted Financial Information includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA,
EBIT, Tax-Effected EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow. Please see the tables below for a description of how Heska
defines these non-GAAP financial measures. Heska believes that such non-GAAP financial measures provide
information useful in assessing operating and financial performance across periods. Non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with
GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures used by Heska may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies.
In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Special Meeting will be held several months after the
Forecasted Financial Information was prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information,
Heska stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such information, and Heska
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cautions you that the Forecasted Financial Information should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the
historical financial statements and other information regarding Heska contained in its public filings with the SEC. See
the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The Company engaged each of BofA Securities and Piper Sandler to act as its financial advisors in connection
with the Merger.
Opinion of BofA Securities, Inc.
Heska has retained BofA Securities to act as Heska’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger. BofA
Securities is an internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Heska selected BofA Securities to act as Heska’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger on the basis of
BofA Securities’ experience in transactions similar to the Merger, its reputation in the investment community and its
familiarity with Heska and its business.
On March 31, 2023, at a meeting of the Heska Board held to evaluate the Merger, BofA Securities delivered to
the Heska Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 31, 2023, to the
effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described
in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Common Stock (other than holders of (a) shares
of Restricted Stock, (b) shares owned (or held in treasury) by Heska, (c) shares owned by any of Heska’s wholly-
owned subsidiaries, Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub (or any other subsidiary of Mars) or (d) shares for which a holder
properly perfects its appraisal rights under the DGCL) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of BofA Securities’ written opinion to the Heska Board, which describes, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex C to this document and is incorporated by reference herein in its
41TABLE OF CONTENTS
entirety. The following summary of BofA Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the opinion. BofA Securities delivered its opinion to the Heska Board for the benefit and use of the Heska Board
(in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the Merger Consideration from a
financial point of view. BofA Securities’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and no opinion or
view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that
might be available to Heska or in which Heska might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Heska to
proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Securities’ opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed
Merger or any related matter.
In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Securities:
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Heska;
•
reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and
prospects of Heska furnished to or discussed with BofA Securities by the management of Heska, including
certain financial forecasts relating to Heska prepared by the management of Heska (referred to in this proxy
statement as the “Forecasted Financial Information” and summarized in the section entitled “The Merger-
Certain Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information”);
•
discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Heska with
members of senior management of Heska;
•
reviewed the trading history for Heska Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the
trading histories of other companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;
•
compared certain financial and stock market information of Heska with similar information of other
companies BofA Securities deemed relevant;
•
compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other
transactions BofA Securities deemed relevant;
•
reviewed a draft dated March 31, 2023 of the Merger Agreement; and
•
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA
Securities deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, BofA Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of the management of Heska that they
were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in
any material respect. With respect to the Forecasted Financial Information, BofA Securities was advised by Heska,
and assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good
faith judgments of the management of Heska as to the future financial performance of Heska. BofA Securities did not
make or was not provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Heska or any other entity, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Heska
or any other entity. BofA Securities did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Heska, Acquiror, Mars or any other
entity under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Securities
assumed, at the direction of Heska, that the Merger would be consummated in accordance with its terms, without
waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining
the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications,
would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Heska or any other entity or the contemplated benefits of the
Merger.
BofA Securities expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the Merger (other than the
Consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of
the Merger or any terms, aspects or implications of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into
in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. BofA Securities was not requested to, and it did not, solicit
indications of interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all or
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
any part of Heska or any alternative transaction. BofA Securities’ opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Common Stock (other than holders of (a)
shares of Restricted Stock, (b) shares owned (or held in treasury) by Heska, (c) shares owned by any of Heska’s
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub (or any other subsidiary of Mars) or (d) shares for which a
holder properly perfects its appraisal rights under the DGCL) and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to
any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness
(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers,
directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration.
Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other
strategies or transactions that might be available to Heska or in which Heska might engage or as to the underlying
business decision of Heska to proceed with or effect the Merger. In addition, BofA Securities expressed no view or
opinion with respect to, and relied, with the consent of Heska, upon the assessments of Heska and its
representatives regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Heska or any other entity
and the Merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof) as to which BofA Securities understood that Heska
obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. BofA Securities further expressed no
opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any
related matter. Except as described above, Heska imposed no other limitations on the investigations made or
procedures followed by BofA Securities in rendering its opinion.
BofA Securities’ opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions
and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Securities as of, the date of its opinion.
BofA Securities noted that the credit, financial and stock markets had been experiencing unusual volatility and BofA
Securities expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on Heska, Acquiror, Mars or the
Merger. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and BofA Securities does not
have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Securities’ opinion was approved
by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Securities.
The following represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the
Heska Board in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Securities, the

TABLE OF CONTENTS
BofA Securities reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies,
calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on March 30, 2023 plus debt and non-controlling interest
(as applicable) less cash, as a multiple of calendar year 2023 and calendar year 2024 estimated revenue (referred to in
this section as “EV / 2023E Revenue” and “EV / 2024E Revenue”, respectively). BofA Securities also reviewed
enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies as a multiple of calendar year 2023 and calendar year 2024
Non-GAAP adjusted estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortization (referred to as
“Adjusted EBITDA”) (referred to in this section as “EV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA” and “EV / 2024E Adjusted
EBITDA”, respectively). Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly
available research analysts’ estimates, adjusted to be unburdened for stock-based compensation, as applicable, and
estimated financial data of Heska were based on Forecasted Financial Information.
The overall low to high EV / 2023E Revenue multiples observed for the selected companies were (i) 2.88x to
11.68x for the animal health diagnosis / genetics companies (with a median of 7.28x) and (ii) 1.01x to 9.35x for the
animal health pharma companies (with a median of 2.11x). The overall low to high EV / 2024E Revenue multiples
observed for the selected companies were (i) 2.70x to 10.61 for the animal health diagnosis / genetics companies (with
a median of 6.66x) and (ii) 0.97x to 8.67x for the animal health pharma companies (with a median of 2.03x). BofA
Securities noted that the EV / 2023E Revenue multiple observed for Heska was 3.74x and that the EV / 2024E Revenue
multiple observed for Heska was 3.24x, in each case, based on the Forecasted Financial Information.
BofA Securities then applied a selected range of EV / 2023E Revenue and EV / 2024E Revenue multiples derived
from the selected companies of 2.15x to 5.00x and 2.05x to 4.50x, respectively, to Heska’s 2023E and 2024E,
respectively, estimated revenue, as set forth in the Forecasted Financial Information.
The overall low to high EV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies were (i)
17.2x to 33.8x for the animal health diagnosis / genetics companies (with a median of 25.5x) and (ii) 8.5x to 21.4x for the
animal health pharma companies (with a median of 10.4x). The overall low to high EV / 2024E Adjusted EBITDA
multiples observed for the selected companies were (i) 15.2x to 30.4x for the animal health diagnosis / genetics
companies (with a median of 22.8x) and (ii) 7.7x to 19.5x for the animal health pharma companies (with a median of
9.5x). BofA Securities noted that the EV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA multiple observed for Heska was 37.1x and that the
EV / 2024E Adjusted EBITDA multiple observed for Heska was 24.0x, in each case, based on the Forecasted Financial
Information.
BofA Securities then applied a selected range of EV / 2023E Adjusted EBITDA and EV / 2024E Adjusted
EBITDA multiples derived from the selected companies of 21.5x to 39.0x and 19.5x to 31.0x, respectively, to Heska’s
2023E and 2024E, respectively, estimated Adjusted EBITDA, as set forth in the Forecasted Financial Information.
This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Heska,
rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share, as compared to the Merger Consideration:
Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Ranges for Heska

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Heska. Accordingly, an evaluation of the
results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
public trading or other values of the companies to which Heska was compared.

BofA Securities reviewed transaction values, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target company
based on the consideration payable in the selected transaction, as multiples of the target company’s latest 12 months
(“LTM”) Adjusted EBITDA and as multiples of estimates of the target company’s next fiscal year (“FY+1”) Adjusted
EBITDA, in each case, as of the applicable announcement dates of the selected transactions (referred to in this
section as “EV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA” and “EV / FY+1 Adjusted EBITDA”, respectively). Estimated financial data
of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant
transaction. Estimated financial data of Heska were based on Forecasted Financial Information. The overall low to
high EV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were 16.0x to 30.0x (with a mean of
19.1x and a median of 17.9x). The overall low to high EV / FY+1 Adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected
transactions were 11.5x to 21.6x (with a mean of 15.6x and a median of 15.1x). BofA Securities then applied a selected
range of EV / LTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples derived from the selected transactions of 18.0x to 30.0x to the 2022A
Adjusted EBITDA of Heska, as reflected in Heska’s public filings, and applied a selected range of EV / FY+1
Adjusted EBITDA multiples derived from the selected transactions of 15.0x to 22.0x to the 2024E estimated Adjusted
EBITDA of Heska, as provided by Heska management and as reflected in Forecasted Financial Information. This
analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Heska, rounded to

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Heska to
calculate the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Heska was forecasted
to generate during Heska’s fiscal years 2023 through 2027 based on the Forecasted Financial Information. BofA
Securities calculated terminal values for Heska by applying a range of perpetuity growth rates of 3.5% to 4.5%, based
on input from Heska management, to Heska’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2027 estimated unlevered, after-tax free
cash flows. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 using
discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, which were based on an estimate of Heska’s weighted average cost of
capital. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Heska,
rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share, as compared to the Merger Consideration:

Other Factors
BofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities’ material
financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other
things, the following:
•
historical trading prices and trading volumes of Common Stock, which indicated low and high closing
prices for Common Stock during the 52-week period ended March 30, 2023 of approximately $60.21 per
share and $147.57 per share, respectively;
•
stock price targets for Heska as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street research analysts’
reports, which indicated low and high stock price targets of $58.00 per share and $150.00 per share,
respectively, on an undiscounted basis and approximately $53.21 per share and $137.61 per share,
respectively, on a present value basis; and
•
premia paid in U.S. public company all-cash mergers and acquisitions transactions across all industries with
transaction values of over $1 billion announced between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2022 measured
in relation to each target company’s closing share price on the day prior to the announcement of the
applicable transaction (or on the day prior to the unaffected date prior to the announcement of the
transaction, when applicable), which based on application of a premia reference range of 22% - 52% to the
closing price of Common Stock on March 30, 2023 of $97.35, indicated an implied per share equity value
reference range for Heska ranging from $118.77 to $147.97.
Miscellaneous
As noted above, the discussion set forth above is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by
BofA Securities to the Heska Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all
analyses undertaken by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial
opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its
analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions
of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Securities’ analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific
analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater
weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.
In performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Heska. The estimates of the future
performance of Heska in or underlying BofA Securities’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by
BofA Securities’ analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities’ analysis of the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration and were provided to the Heska
46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities’ opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may
trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any
particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be
BofA Securities’ view of the actual values of Heska.
The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between
Heska and Mars, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Heska Board. The decision to enter
into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Heska Board. As described above, BofA Securities’ opinion and
analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Heska Board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and
should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Heska Board or management with respect to the Merger or
the Merger Consideration.
Heska has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee
currently estimated to be approximately $9 million, $2 million of which was payable upon the delivery of its opinion
and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. Heska also has agreed to
reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities’ engagement and to indemnify
BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.
BofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in
securities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal
investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management,
financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,
governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates invest on a
principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance
positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments
(including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of Heska, Mars and certain of their respective affiliates.
BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may
provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Heska and certain of its affiliates
and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including having
provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Heska and/or certain of its affiliates.
From March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from
Heska and certain of its affiliates of less than $1 million for investment and corporate banking services.
In addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future
may provide, investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Mars and certain of its affiliates
and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having
acted as financial advisor to Mars in connection with an acquisition transaction, (ii) having acted or acting as a
bookrunner, arranger and syndication agent for, and/or as a lender under, certain term loans, letters of credit, credit
and leasing facilities and other credit arrangements of Mars and/or certain of its affiliates, (iii) having provided or
providing certain derivatives, foreign exchange and other trading services to Mars and/or certain of its affiliates, and
(iv) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Mars and/or certain of its
affiliates. From March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues
from Mars and certain of its affiliates of approximately $21 million for investment and corporate banking services.
Opinion of Piper Sandler & Co.
On March 31, 2023, Piper Sandler rendered its oral opinion to the Heska Board, which was subsequently
confirmed in writing by delivery of Piper Sandler’s written opinion, dated March 31, 2023, to the effect that, as of such
date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the
Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock.
The full text of Piper Sandler’s written opinion dated March 31, 2023, which sets forth, among other things,
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
review undertaken by Piper Sandler in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement. Piper
Sandler’s opinion addressed solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock, of
the Merger Consideration and does not address any other terms or agreements relating to the Merger or any other
terms of the Merger Agreement. Piper Sandler’s opinion was directed to the Heska Board in connection with its
consideration of the Merger and was not intended to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to any Heska
stockholder as to how such Heska stockholder should act or vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.
Piper Sandler’s opinion was approved for issuance by the Piper Sandler opinion committee.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Piper
Sandler, among other things:
•
reviewed and analyzed the financial terms contained in a copy of the Merger Agreement dated March 31,
2023, labeled “Execution Version”;
•
reviewed and analyzed certain financial and other data with respect to Heska that was publicly available;
•
reviewed and analyzed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to the business, earnings,
cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of Heska that were publicly available, as well as those that were
furnished to Piper Sandler by Heska (referred to in this proxy statement as the “Forecasted Financial
Information” and summarized in the section entitled “The Merger-Certain Unaudited Forecasted Financial
Information”);
•
conducted discussions with members of senior management and representatives of Heska concerning the
two immediately preceding matters, as well as Heska’s business and prospects before and after giving
effect to the Merger;
•
reviewed the current and historical reported prices and trading activity of shares of Common Stock and
similar information for certain other companies deemed by Piper Sandler to be comparable to Heska;
•
compared the financial performance of Heska with that of certain other publicly traded companies that Piper
Sandler deemed relevant; and
•
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions
that Piper Sandler deemed relevant.
In addition, Piper Sandler conducted such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other
financial, economic and market criteria as Piper Sandler deemed necessary in arriving at its opinion.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Piper Sandler in connection with the
preparation of its fairness opinion and reviewed with the Heska Board at a meeting of the Heska Board held on March
31, 2023.
This summary includes information presented in tabular format, which tables must be read together with the text
of each analysis summary and considered as a whole in order to fully understand the financial analyses presented by
Piper Sandler. The tables alone do not constitute a complete summary of the financial analyses conducted by Piper
Sandler. The order in which these analyses are presented below, and the results of those analyses, should not be
taken as any indication of the relative importance or weight given to any of these analyses by Piper Sandler or the
Heska Board. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on
market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before March 30, 2023 and is not necessarily indicative of
current market conditions.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, for purposes of the financial analyses described below, Piper Sandler
calculated enterprise value (“EV”; defined as the relevant company’s common equity value, plus, where applicable,
book value of preferred stock, plus fair value of contingent consideration, plus debt, plus capital and operating
leases, less cash and cash equivalents, less investments in partnerships, and less short- and long-term investments
(“net debt”), plus, where applicable, book value of non-controlling interests), including (a) EV for each publicly
traded company included in the selected public companies analysis described below under the heading “Selected
Public Companies Analysis” (as well as Heska), based on (i) the market value of the relevant company’s common
equity, using closing stock prices on March 30, 2023 and (ii) the relevant company’s net

based on (i) the implied value of the relevant target company’s common equity using the implied purchase price paid
for such target company’s common equity in the relevant M&A transaction and the relevant target company’s net
debt as of such target company’s most recently reported quarter end immediately prior to announcement of the
relevant M&A transaction (in the case of M&A transactions involving the acquisition of public companies) or
otherwise (ii) the publicly announced EV for the target company at the time of announcement of the relevant M&A
transaction. Additionally, references to (a) “LTM” historical financial information are references to (i) for each
publicly traded company included in the selected public companies analysis described below under the heading
“Selected Public Companies Analysis” (as well as Heska), the last 12-month period for which financial information
was publicly available as of March 30, 2023, based on such publicly available information and (ii) for each target
company included in the selected M&A transactions described below under the heading “Selected M&A
Transactions Analysis,” the last 12-month period for which financial information was publicly available as of
immediately prior to the announcement of the relevant M&A transaction, based on such publicly available
information, and (b) projected financial information (i) for each target company included in the selected M&A
transactions analysis described below are based on Wall Street consensus equity research estimates (“Consensus
Estimates”) disclosure by such target company or otherwise available to Piper Sandler, at the time of announcement
of the relevant transaction and (ii) for Heska, the 12-month period immediately following the LTM period, based on
estimates provided to Piper Sandler by Heska management. Diluted shares were calculated using the treasury stock
method as of March 30, 2023 and in the case of Heska, included restricted stock units, in-the-money options, and
shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, including additional shares of Common Stock issuable as
a result of the make-whole provision with respect to the Convertible Notes.
Selected Public Companies Analysis
Piper Sandler reviewed, among other things, historical LTM financial information for Heska, as well as projected
financial data prepared by Heska management for the years ending December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024 as
included in the Forecasted Financial Information and compared such data to corresponding historical financial
information and Consensus Estimates for the public companies that Piper Sandler considered to be U.S.-listed
companies in each of animal health diagnostics / pharmaceuticals, animal heath distributors, and small- to mid-cap
(market cap < $15 billion) (“Smid Cap”) product diagnostics. No company used in the selected public companies
analysis is identical to Heska and, as a result, the summary below and underlying financial analyses involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that
could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which Heska was compared.
Piper Sandler selected the following companies in the following categories:
•
Animal Health Diagnostics / Pharmaceuticals:
•
Merck & Co., Inc.
•
Zoetis Inc.
•
IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.
•
Elanco Animal Health, Inc.

For the selected public companies analysis, Piper Sandler calculated calendar year (“calendar year” or “CY”),
projected 2023 and 2024 revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), LTM
EBITDA margin, projected revenue growth, EV/revenue, EV/EBITDA, and stock price/earnings (based on the closing
price on March 30, 2023 and adjusted Consensus Estimates, respectively) multiples for each selected public company
in each category. In the animal health diagnostics / pharmaceuticals and animal health distributors category, Piper
Sandler compared the EV/EBITDA multiples for the selected public companies to the corresponding multiple for
Heska based on the closing price per share of Heska common stock on March 30, 2023 (the “March 30th Closing
Price”) and the Merger Consideration. In the Smid-Cap product diagnostic category, Piper Sandler compared the
EV/revenue and EV/EBITDA multiples to the corresponding multiple for Heska based on the March 30th Closing
Price and the Merger Consideration. Piper Sandler utilized CY 2023 and CY 2024 revenue and EBITDA estimates for
Heska based on the Forecasted Financial Information. Projected CY 2023 and CY 2024 revenue, EBITDA, and revenue
growth for the selected public companies were based on Consensus Estimates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using a discounted cash flows analysis, Piper Sandler calculated an estimated range of theoretical EVs for
Heska based on the present value of (i) projected free cash flows to Heska for fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year
2027 and (ii) a projected terminal value at December 31, 2027 based upon perpetuity growth rates between 3.5% and
4.5%, selected by Piper Sandler based on its professional judgment, and in each case, discounted back to December
31, 2022. The free cash flows to the firm for each fiscal year and terminal year value were calculated from the
Forecasted Financial Information. Piper Sandler calculated the range of present values for free cash flows to the firm
for such periods based on a range of discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%, based on its estimation of Heska’s
weighted average cost of capital of 8.5%.
This analysis resulted in implied per share values for Common Stock ranging from $75.50 to $109.44 per share.
Piper Sandler observed that the Merger Consideration was greater than the highest implied per share value derived
from this analysis.
Other Information
Piper Sandler also noted for the Heska Board the following additional information that was not relied upon in
rendering its opinion, but was provided for informational purposes.
•
Historical Trading Analysis. Piper Sandler reviewed the historical closing stock prices and trading volumes
for Common Stock over the 52-week period, which reflected low and high closing prices during such
periods ranging from $60.21 to $147.57 per share, respectively, as compared to the Merger Consideration of
$120.00.
•
Premiums Paid Analysis. Piper Sandler reviewed publicly available information for selected completed
M&A transactions to determine the implied premiums paid in such M&A transactions over recent trading
prices of the relevant target companies at certain dates prior to announcement of the relevant transaction
(or prior to public reporting of market speculation with respect to relevant transaction if such reporting
occurred prior to announcement). Piper Sandler selected M&A transactions announced since January 1,
2015 involving those public target companies that Piper Sandler considered to be in (i) the animal health
industry and (ii) the medical technologies and life sciences tools and diagnostics industries with
transaction values between $250 million and $3.0 billion. Based on these criteria, Piper Sandler reviewed 14
transactions, and compared, among other things, the implied premiums paid in those selected M&A
transactions over certain time periods to the premium that would be paid to the holders of Common Stock
based on the Merger Consideration.
The analysis indicated the following premiums:

Miscellaneous
The summary set forth above does not contain a complete description of the analyses performed by Piper
Sandler and reviewed with the Heska Board. The preparation of a fairness opinion is not necessarily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. Piper Sandler believes that its analyses and the summary set forth above
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses or of the summary, without considering the
analyses as a whole or all of the factors included in its analyses, would create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying the analyses set forth in Piper Sandler’s opinion. In arriving at its opinion, Piper Sandler considered the
results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
or analysis. Instead, Piper Sandler made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and financial
judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. In addition, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Piper Sandler’s view of the actual value of Heska.
None of the selected companies or transactions used in the analyses above is directly comparable to Heska or
the Merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is not purely mathematical; rather, it involves
considerations and judgments concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating
characteristics of the selected companies and target businesses in the selected transactions and other factors that
could affect the public trading values of such companies or transaction values of such businesses.
Piper Sandler performed its analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Heska Board. In performing its
analyses, Piper Sandler made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and
economic conditions and other matters. Certain of the analyses performed by Piper Sandler were based upon the
Forecasted Financial Information furnished to Piper Sandler by Heska management, which are not necessarily
indicative of actual future results and may be significantly more or less favorable than actual future results. The
Forecasted Financial Information is inherently subject to uncertainty because, among other things, they are based
upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors. Piper Sandler does
not assume responsibility if future results are materially different from projected financial results.
Piper Sandler’s opinion was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Heska Board in making the
determination to approve the Merger Agreement. While Piper Sandler provided advice to the Heska Board during
Heska’s negotiations with Acquiror and its parent, Mars, Piper Sandler did not recommend any specific amount or
type of consideration.
Piper Sandler relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made
available, to Piper Sandler or discussed with or reviewed by Piper Sandler. Piper Sandler further relied upon the
assurances of Heska management that the financial information provided was prepared on a reasonable basis in
accordance with industry practice, and that Heska management was not aware of any information or facts that would
make any information provided to Piper Sandler incomplete or misleading. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, for the purpose of its opinion, Piper Sandler assumed that with respect to the Forecasted Financial
Information, estimates and other forward-looking information reviewed by Piper Sandler, that such information was
reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Heska
management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Heska. Piper Sandler expressed
no opinion as to any such financial forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information or the assumptions on which
they were based. Piper Sandler relied, with consent of the Heska Board, on advice of the outside counsel and the
independent accountants to Heska, and on the assumptions of Heska management, as to all accounting, legal, tax
and financial reporting matters with respect to Heska and the Merger Agreement.
In arriving at its opinion, Piper Sandler assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would be in all material
respects identical to the last draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by Piper Sandler. Piper Sandler relied upon and
assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the representations and warranties of all parties to the Merger
Agreement and all other related documents and instruments that are referred to therein were true and correct, (ii) each
party to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
by such party, (iii) the Merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement without
amendments thereto and (iv) all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver by
any party of any conditions or obligations thereunder. Additionally, Piper Sandler assumed that all the necessary
regulatory approvals and consents required for the Merger will be obtained in a manner that will not adversely affect
Heska or the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
In arriving at its opinion, Piper Sandler did not perform any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or
liabilities (fixed, contingent or other) of Heska, and was not furnished or provided with any such appraisals or
valuations, nor did Piper Sandler evaluate the solvency of Heska under any state or federal law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. The analyses performed by Piper Sandler in connection with its opinion
were going concern analyses. Piper Sandler expressed no opinion regarding the liquidation value of
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Heska or any other entity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper Sandler undertook no independent
analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent
liabilities, to which Heska or any of its affiliates is a party or may be subject, and at the direction of Heska and with its
consent, Piper Sandler’s opinion made no assumption concerning, and therefore did not consider, the possible
assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. Piper Sandler also assumed that neither
Heska nor Acquiror was party to any material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing,
recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the Merger.
Piper Sandler’s opinion was necessarily based upon the information available to it and facts and circumstances
as they existed and were subject to evaluation on the date of its opinion. Events occurring after the date of Piper
Sandler’s opinion could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing its opinion. Piper Sandler expressed no
opinion as to the price at which Common Stock may trade following announcement of the Merger or at any future
time. Piper Sandler did not undertake to reaffirm or revise its opinion or otherwise comment upon any events
occurring after the date of its opinion and does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Piper Sandler’s opinion addressed solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common
Stock of the Merger Consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement and did not address any other terms or
agreement relating to the Merger or any other terms of the Merger Agreement. Piper Sandler was not requested to
opine as to, and its opinion does not address, the basic business decision to proceed with or effect the Merger, the
merits of the Merger relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to Heska,
Acquiror’s ability to fund the Merger Consideration (taking into account the guaranty from its parent, Mars), any
other terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the fairness of the Merger to any other class of securities,
creditor or other constituency of Heska. Furthermore, Piper Sandler expressed no opinion with respect to the amount
or nature of compensation to any officer, director or employee of any party to the Merger, or any class of such
persons, relative to the compensation to be received by the holders of Common Stock in the Merger or with respect
to the fairness of any such compensation.
Information about Piper Sandler
As a part of its investment banking business, Piper Sandler is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses
in the animal health, medical diagnostics and other industries and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. The Heska Board selected Piper Sandler to be its financial advisor and
render its fairness opinion in connection with the Merger on the basis of such experience and its familiarity with
Heska.
Piper Sandler acted as financial advisor to Heska in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee, currently
estimated to be approximately $9 million, from Heska, which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger,
except for $2.0 million of such fee which was payable to Piper Sandler upon the rendering its fairness opinion and was
creditable against the total fee. The opinion fee was not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger or the
conclusions reached in Piper Sandler’s opinion. Heska has also agreed to indemnify Piper Sandler against certain
liabilities and reimburse Piper Sandler for certain expenses in connection with its services. Piper Sandler may, in the
future, provide financial advisory and financing services to Heska and its affiliates and may receive fees for the
rendering of such services. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Piper Sandler and its affiliates may
actively trade securities of Heska and Mars or entities that are affiliated with Mars, for its own account or the account
of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Piper Sandler may
also, in the future, provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Heska, Mars or entities that are
affiliated with Heska or Mars, for which Piper Sandler would expect to receive compensation.
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Piper Sandler has adopted policies and procedures
to establish and maintain the independence of Piper Sandler’s research department and personnel. As a result, Piper
Sandler’s research analysts may hold opinions, make statements or recommendations and/or publish research reports
with respect to Heska, Mars, the Merger and other participants in the Merger that differ from the opinions of Piper
Sandler’s investment banking personnel.

If the Merger Proposal receives the required approvals of Heska stockholders described elsewhere in this proxy
statement and the other conditions to the Closing of the Merger are either satisfied or waived and the Merger
Agreement is not otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Heska
upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. As the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, Heska will continue
to exist following the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror.
Heska’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and the Bylaws will be
amended and restated as a result of the Merger in forms to be mutually agreed between Heska and Mars (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (which will include provisions with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses that are no less favorable to the Company Indemnified

Incorporation, Bylaws and Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation” beginning on page 66 with respect to
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and
the Bylaws as of March 31, 2023).
Following the Merger, all of Common Stock will be beneficially owned by Mars, and none of the holders of
Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Merger will, by virtue of the Merger, have any ownership interest in, or
be a stockholder of, Heska, the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror or Mars. As a result, the holders of Common Stock
as of immediately prior to the Merger will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear the risk
of any decrease in the value, of Common Stock. Following the Merger, Mars will benefit from any increase in Heska’s
value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in Heska’s value.
At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to
furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders’ meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act,

Effects on Heska if the Merger Is Not Completed
In the event that the Merger Proposal does not receive the required approvals of Heska stockholders described",66,67
HESKA CORP_20230508_DEFM14A_20858914_4661346.Pdf,Effects on Heska If the Merger Is Not Completed,"In the event that the Merger Proposal does not receive the required approvals of Heska stockholders described
elsewhere in this proxy statement, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Heska’s stockholders will
not receive any Merger Consideration or other payment for their shares of Common Stock in connection with the
Merger. Instead, Heska expects that its management will operate Heska’s business in a manner similar to that in which
it is being operated today and Heska will remain an independent public company, the Common Stock will continue to
be listed and traded on NASDAQ, Common Stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and Heska
stockholders will continue to own their shares of Common Stock and will continue to be subject to the same general
risks and opportunities as they currently are with respect to ownership of Common Stock.
If the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurances as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on
the future value of your shares of Common Stock, including the risk that the market price of Common Stock may
decline to the extent that the current market price of Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will
be completed. If the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurances that any other transaction acceptable to
Heska will be offered or that the business, operations, financial condition, earnings or prospects of Heska will not be
adversely impacted or that Heska stockholders will ever receive a control premium for their shares. Pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances Heska is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to
enter into an alternative transaction. Please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination of the
Merger Agreement.”
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, Heska may be obligated to pay to Acquiror the
Termination Fee. Please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Termination Fee.”",67,67

Heska’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are in addition to, or different from, the
interests of other stockholders, including the holding of Options, Restricted Stock and/or RSUs, participation in the
ESPP, payments under the MIP, deal bonuses and enhanced severance benefits pursuant to their respective
employment agreements. The Heska Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters,
in evaluating and approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending the approval of the Merger
Proposal and the Advisory Compensation Proposal to Heska stockholders. These interests are described in further
detail below.

Treatment of Options
In connection with the completion of the Merger and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each
Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested
and whether subject to service-based or performance-based vesting conditions) will be deemed fully vested
(including with respect to any performance-based vesting requirements) and cancelled in exchange for a cash
payment of $120.00 per share subject to such Option less the applicable per share exercise price, subject to tax
withholding pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the exercise price per share of an Option is equal to or greater than
$120.00 per share, such Option will be cancelled for no consideration.
The following sets forth, for each executive officer (or former executive officer that served as an executive officer
since January 1, 2022) and director, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding Options
held by such executive officer or director as of the Record Date, and the estimated value of such Options assuming
such executive officer or director remains continuously employed with or providing services to Heska or a subsidiary
until the Effective Time.

Treatment of Restricted Stock
In connection with the completion of the Merger and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share
of Restricted Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be deemed fully vested
(including with respect to any performance-based vesting requirements, which will be deemed to be achieved at
maximum performance) and cancelled in exchange for a cash payment of $120.00 per share, subject to tax withholding
pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The following sets forth, for each executive officer (or former executive officer that served as an executive officer
since January 1, 2022), the aggregate number of shares of Restricted Stock held by such executive officer as of the
Record Date, and the estimated value of such Restricted Stock assuming such executive officer remains continuously
employed with Heska or a subsidiary until the Effective Time. Each non-employee director had 1,107 shares of
Restricted Stock as of the Record Date that vested on May 4, 2023.

Treatment of RSUs
In connection with the completion of the Merger and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RSU
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be deemed fully vested (including with respect to
performance-based vesting requirements, other than with respect to the performance-based RSUs granted to certain
employees, including certain of the executive officers, in March 2023, which will be deemed vested at the greater of
target or actual level of performance) and cancelled in exchange for a cash payment of $120.00 per RSU, subject to tax
withholding pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The following sets forth, for each executive officer (or former executive officer that served as an executive officer
since January 1, 2022), the aggregate number of RSUs (assuming target performance) held by such executive officer
as of the Record Date, and the estimated value of such RSUs assuming such executive officer remains continuously
employed with Heska or a subsidiary until the Effective Time. No non-employee director holds any RSUs.

Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plans
Prior to the Effective Time, Heska will take all actions necessary to provide, contingent on the Effective Time: (i)
no new offering period under the ESPP will commence following March 31, 2023, (ii) there will be no increase in the
amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the ESPP and no contributions other than previously
elected payroll deductions during the current offering period from those in effect as of March 31, 2023, (iii) no
individual will commence participation in the ESPP prior to the Effective Time, (iv) that each outstanding purchase
right issued pursuant to the ESPP will be fully exercised on the earlier of (a) June 30, 2023 and (b) ten business days
prior to the Effective Time and (v) the ESPP will be terminated effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Ms. Grassman, Mr. Eyl, Ms. Baker and Mr. Providenti each participate in the ESPP during the current offering period.
If they each contribute the maximum amount permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which we refer to as
the “Code”, it is expected that they will each acquire 396 shares of Heska Common Stock upon the exercise of their
outstanding purchase rights for the current offering period; however, they may acquire fewer shares if the
contributions are less than the maximum amount permitted under the Code.
Management Incentive Plan
Each executive officer currently participates in the MIP. Under the terms of the MIP and the Merger Agreement,
in the event of a “change in control” of Heska (as defined in the MIP and which the Merger will constitute), each
participant will receive a pro-rated MIP target bonus, payable within 60 days of the change in control.
The Merger will constitute a “change in control” under the MIP. Assuming the Effective Time occurs on July 1,
2023, the approximate value of the pro-rated MIP target bonuses that would be payable to Heska’s executive officers
is as follows: Kevin S. Wilson - $495,890, Catherine I. Grassman - $99,178, Steven M. Eyl - $92,979, Eleanor F. Baker -
$92,979, Christopher D. Sveen - $90,500, Anthony Providenti - $92,979 and Nancy Wisnewski - $92,979.
Deal Bonuses
In recognition of their individual efforts in connection with the Merger, and subject to their respective
continuous employment with Heska or a subsidiary through the 60th day following the Effective Time (or, if earlier,
upon the termination of employment without cause), certain of the executive officers will receive supplemental cash
bonuses as follows: Catherine I. Grassman - $158,000, Steven M. Eyl - $111,000, Eleanor F. Baker - $150,000,
Christopher D. Sveen - $147,500, and Anthony Providenti - $150,000.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Employment Agreements
Heska has entered into employment agreements with each of its executive officers (the “Employment
Agreements”). Each Employment Agreement provides for enhanced severance benefits in the event the executive
officer is terminated without “cause” or resigns for “good reason” (each as defined in each Employment Agreement)
during the period beginning three months prior to a “change of control” of Heska (as defined in each Employment
Agreement) and ending 18 months following a change of control (or, for Mr. Wilson, 24 months following a change of
control) (such termination, a “COC Termination”). In the event of a COC Termination:
•
Mr. Wilson would receive (i) a lump sum severance payment equal to 2.99x the sum of his base salary and
his target bonus for the year of termination and (ii) Heska-paid COBRA premiums for up to 36 months; and
•
Each other executive officer would receive (i) severance equal to 12 months of his base salary, payable in
installments and (ii) Heska-paid COBRA premiums for up to 12 months.
In addition, if Ms. Baker elects to relocate back to the United States in connection with a COC Termination,
Heska will pay or reimburse her reasonable relocation expenses. The Employment Agreements also subject each of
the executive officers to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants in the event of a COC
Termination ranging from six months to 12 months following termination of employment (or, for Mr. Wilson, 36
months following a COC Termination or a termination as a result of death or disability following a change of control).
If any of the severance benefits under the Employment Agreements constitute “parachute payments” within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the
“Excise Tax”), then the severance benefits will either be (i) provided in full or (ii) provided to such lesser extent that
would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts,
when taking into account applicable federal, state, local, and foreign income and employment taxes, the Excise Tax,
and any other applicable taxes, results in the receipt by the executive officer, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest
amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be subject to the Excise Tax.
The Merger will constitute a “change of control” under the Employment Agreements. For the quantification of
the estimated value of the severance payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Heska’s
named executive officers, see the table below titled “Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation.”

As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Heska’s executive officers has entered into any new agreement,
arrangement or understanding with Acquiror or any of its affiliates regarding the terms and conditions of
compensation, incentive pay or employment with the Company after the Merger. Although no agreements have been
entered into at this time with any of Heska’s executive officers, prior to or following the completion of the Merger,
they may enter into new agreements and/or amendments to existing employment or severance agreements with
Acquiror or one of its affiliates regarding their employment with the Company after the Merger.

The information set forth below is required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding compensation that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Merger that Heska’s named executive officers could receive in connection with
the Merger, as described more fully above the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger.” Such amounts have been calculated assuming (i) the Effective Time is July 1, 2023, which is
the assumed date of Closing of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosures in this section, (ii) a per share
Merger Consideration amount equal to $120.00 per share of Common Stock, (iii) the annual base salary and annual
target bonus opportunity for each of the executive officers remains unchanged from the date hereof, (iv) none of the
named executive officers receives any additional equity-based awards following the date hereof, (v) each named
executive officer experiences a COC Termination at or immediately following the Effective Time, (vi) the golden
parachute rules under Section 280G of the Code do not limit the payments to the named executive officer pursuant to

All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, and any rights to advancement of expenses in favor of Heska indemnified parties, as provided in the
organizational documents of Heska or its subsidiaries existing as of March 31, 2023 or any indemnification
agreements existing as of March 31, 2023 will survive the Merger and may not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of Heska indemnified parties with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror will ensure the surviving corporation honors these obligations.
Prior to the Effective Time, at Heska’s option, Heska will, or, if Heska is unable to, Acquiror will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancelable extension of the directors’ and
officers’ liability coverage of Heska’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and Heska’s existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time

obtained as of the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation is required to maintain in effect, for a period of not
less than six years following the Effective Time, Heska’s current directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability
insurance policies or a comparable policy, subject to certain limitations and minimum standards.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations",72,72
HESKA CORP_20230508_DEFM14A_20858914_4661346.Pdf,U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,"U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following discussion summarizes the U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to U.S.
holders (as defined below) who exchange Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion applies
only to holders of Common Stock who hold their stock as a capital asset within the meaning of section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which we refer to as the “Code” (generally, an asset held for investment). This
summary is based on the Code, the U.S. Treasury Department regulations issued under the Code, which we refer to as
the “Treasury Regulations,” and administrative rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy
statement, all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could
affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein.
This summary is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the “IRS,” or a court, and
there can be no assurance that the tax consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or
that they would be sustained by a court if so challenged. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no
opinion of counsel has been or will be rendered, as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Common Stock that is for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) a citizen or an individual who is a resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation
(or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of
the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in
gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the
United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B) the trust has a valid election in effect
under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
62TABLE OF CONTENTS
This summary is not a complete description of all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the
Merger and, in particular, may not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of Common
Stock who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law including, for example, partnerships (or
an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and partners therein,
“controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies,” financial institutions, dealers in
securities, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities (including private foundations), mutual funds, real estate
investment trusts, personal holding companies, regulated investment companies, securities or currency dealers,
traders in securities who elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting, non-U.S. holders, tax-exempt
investors, S corporations, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-deferred or other retirement
accounts, U.S. expatriates, former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, holders who acquired Common
Stock pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option or right or otherwise as compensation, and holders who
hold Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction, or other integrated
investment. Also, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to a holder of
Common Stock who exercises appraisal rights under DGCL. In addition, no information is provided with respect to the
tax consequences of the Merger under any U.S. federal law other than income tax laws (including, for example the
U.S. federal estate, gift, Medicare, and alternative minimum tax laws), or any state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws that may
be applicable to a holder. This summary does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the
Merger.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Common Stock,
the tax treatment of a partner in such a partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
that holds Common Stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax
consequences of the Merger to them in their specific circumstances.
The tax consequences of the Merger will depend on a holder’s specific situation. Holders of Common Stock
should consult their tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the Merger relevant to their particular
circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, non-U.S. or
other tax laws and of changes in those laws.
Tax Consequences to U.S. holders
The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will
generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will
recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in
the Merger and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock exchanged therefor.
If a U.S. holder acquired shares of Common Stock by purchasing them, the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its
shares will generally equal the amount the U.S. holder paid for the relevant shares. If a U.S. holder’s holding period in
the shares of Common Stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as of the date of the Merger, the gain
or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including
individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to certain limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Common Stock at different times or different
prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each
block of Common Stock.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments of cash to a U.S. holder of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may, under certain circumstances,
be subject to information reporting and backup withholding, unless the holder provides proof of an applicable
exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of
the backup withholding rules. Certain holders (such as corporations) are exempt from backup withholding.
To avoid backup withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should return a
properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 included with the letter of transmittal, certifying that such holder is a
United States person, that the taxpayer identification number provided in the IRS Form W-9 is correct, and that such
holder is not subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the
required information to the IRS in a timely manner.
The discussion set forth above is included for general information purposes only and is not a complete
analysis or discussion of all potential tax consequences relevant to holders of Common Stock. Holders of
Common Stock are strongly urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the Merger
in their particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any
state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

The completion of the Merger is subject to:
•
any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof, including under any agreement between a party
and a governmental authority agreeing not to consummate the Merger prior to a certain date) under the
HSR Act relating to the consummation of the Merger having expired or been terminated;
•
each other clearance or approval under any antitrust law in the jurisdiction set forth in the specified section
of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall have been obtained (or deemed obtained) or their respective
authority concluded no jurisdiction; and
•
(i) no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has entered any order that remains in effect and no
law has been adopted or is effective, in each case, that temporarily or permanently prohibits, enjoins or
makes illegal the consummation of the Merger or (ii) no legal proceeding has been brought by a
governmental authority that remains pending and that seeks an order that would impose a Legal Restraint.
Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until
required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and statutory waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. On April 14, 2023, both Heska and Acquiror filed their respective Notification and
Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. The waiting period under the HSR Act is expected to expire on
May 15, 2023 unless earlier terminated or extended by the issuance of a Second Request to the parties by the FTC or
the Antitrust Division prior to that time. If the FTC or the Antitrust Division issues a Second Request, the waiting
period with respect to the Merger will be extended for an additional period of 30 calendar days following both parties’
substantial compliance with that request unless earlier terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division. After that
time, the waiting period may be extended only by court order or with the consent of the parties. At any time before or
after the consummation of any such transactions, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take such action under the
antitrust laws of the United States as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to
enjoin the Merger.",74,74

Approval of the Merger Proposal is a condition to completion of the Merger.
The vote on the Merger Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve either the Advisory
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, a Heska stockholder may vote to approve the
Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, and
vice versa.
Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon. A failure to vote (including a failure to instruct your bank, broker, trust or
other nominee to vote) or an abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.
Pursuant to the Voting Agreements, (i) the Wilson Stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to vote 482,578 shares of Common Stock, representing 4.42% of Common Stock outstanding

as of the Record Date, held by the Wilson Stockholders as of such date in favor of the Merger Proposal at the Special

Sveen Stockholders as of such date in favor of the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting. For a more complete
discussion of the Voting Agreements, please see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement - Voting Agreements.”
The Heska Board, after due and careful discussion and consideration, unanimously (i) determined that the
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and
fair to, and in the best interests of, Heska and the Heska stockholders, (ii) approved, authorized, adopted and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Heska stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

intended to provide any factual information about Heska or modify or supplement any factual disclosures about
Heska in its public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the Merger Agreement and the related summary are not
intended to be disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to Heska. The Merger Agreement contains
representations and warranties by, and covenants of, Heska, Acquiror and Merger Sub (and solely in connection
with providing a guaranty of Acquiror’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement, Mars) that were
made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and
covenants in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be
subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being modified and qualified by confidential
disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead
of establishing these matters as facts and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality or material adverse
effect applicable to the contracting parties that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition,
information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the
date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Heska’s public
disclosures. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you should not
rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual
state of facts or condition of Heska, Acquiror, Merger Sub or Mars.

related to (x) required governmental filings, consents and approvals, (y) conflicts or violations under
contracts, organizational documents and laws and (z) acceleration or triggering of certain employee
benefits, in each case, to the extent the purpose of such representation or warranty is to address the

a change, in and of itself, in the trading price or volume of Common Stock or the failure, in and of itself,
to meet internal or external budgets, forecasts, projections or predictions or analysts’ expectations or
projections for any future period (provided, that the underlying causes of such change or failure may be
taken into account in determining the existence of a “Company Material Adverse Effect”);

Non-Solicitation; Takeover Proposals
Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, Heska will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’ representatives (i) immediately cease and
terminate any ongoing solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than Mars
and its subsidiaries, including Acquiror) with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal (as defined below) and (ii)
not, directly or indirectly:
•
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal;
•
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other person any information in connection with or for the purpose of soliciting, initiating, knowingly
encouraging or knowingly facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal, other than (A) solely in response to
an unsolicited inquiry to refer the inquiring person to the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger
Agreement and to limit its communication exclusively to such referral or (B) upon receipt of a bona fide,
unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation
provisions of the Merger Agreement solely to the extent necessary to ascertain facts or clarify terms in
order for the Heska Board to have sufficient information to determine whether such Company Takeover
Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal (as defined below);
•
approve, adopt, publicly recommend or enter into, or publicly propose to approve, adopt, recommend or
enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle
(whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal (other than
to enter into a confidentiality agreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement);
73TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
take any action to make the provisions of any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,”
“business combination” or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction
under, or a third party becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL) inapplicable
to any person (other than Acquiror and its affiliates) or to any transactions constituting or contemplated
by a Company Takeover Proposal;
•
cooperate with or assist or participate in any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations;
or
•
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Under the Merger Agreement, a “Company Takeover Proposal” means any proposal or offer from any person
(other than Mars or any of its subsidiaries) with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, binding share exchange, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or other similar transaction involving
Heska or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock (or securities
representing 20% or more of the voting power of Heska), (iii) any acquisition (including the acquisition of stock of
any subsidiary of Heska) of assets or businesses of Heska or its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the
consolidated assets, revenues or net income of Heska, (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock (or securities
representing 20% or more of the voting power of Heska) or (v) any combination of the foregoing types of
transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and Common
Stock (or voting power of securities of Heska other than Common Stock) involved is 20% or more.
Receipt of Company Takeover Proposal
If (i) at any time after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval (as defined in the section entitled “Summary - No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals by Heska”
beginning on page 7) (but not after), Heska or any of its representatives receives a bona fide, unsolicited written
Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger
Agreement and (ii) the Heska Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Superior Proposal (as defined below), then Heska and its representatives may, prior to the time
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after:
•
furnish, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable to
Heska than the confidentiality agreement between Heska and Mars, information with respect to Heska to
the party making such Company Takeover Proposal; provided, that, to the extent permitted by law, Heska
must concurrently provide to Acquiror any such information that is non-public; and
•
engage in discussions or negotiations with such party regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.
Under the Merger Agreement, a “Company Superior Proposal” means a bona fide, unsolicited written Company
Takeover Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a third party (or the stockholders of such third party)
acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Common Stock or more than 50% of the assets of
Heska and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) that the Heska Board determines in good faith (in accordance
with the Merger Agreement), after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking
into account the timing and likelihood of consummation relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and after giving effect to any changes to the Merger Agreement proposed by Acquiror in response to
such Company Takeover Proposal (in accordance with the Merger Agreement) and all other financial, legal,
regulatory, tax and other aspects of such Company takeover proposal, including all conditions contained therein and
the person making such Company Takeover Proposal, as the Heska Board deems relevant, is more favorable from a
financial standpoint to Heska stockholders than the Merger.
Notice of Company Takeover Proposal
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Heska must (i) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours after receipt) advise Acquiror of the receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal or a request for information
relating to Heska that constitutes or contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the
74
TABLE OF CONTENTS
identity of the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and a description of the material terms and
conditions thereof and (ii) keep Acquiror reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis as to the status of the
Company Takeover Proposal including any developments, discussions or negotiations and a description of any
changes to the material terms and conditions in respect thereof.
The Company Recommendation; Adverse Recommendation Change; Fiduciary Exception
As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Heska Board has unanimously made the
recommendation that Heska stockholders vote “ FOR ” the proposal to approve the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, the Merger,
which unanimous recommendation we refer to as the “Company Recommendation.” The Merger Agreement provides
that the Heska Board will not affect an “Adverse Recommendation Change” (as described below) except as defined
below.
Under the Merger Agreement, generally, the Heska Board may not: (i) (A) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in this proxy statement; (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the Company
Recommendation; or (C) adopt, approve or recommend to Heska stockholders, or resolve to or publicly propose or
announce its intention to adopt, approve or recommend to Heska stockholders, a Company Takeover Proposal (any
action described in (i) being referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
Heska or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
(including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or
agreement in principle with respect to any such Company Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
entered into in accordance with the Merger Agreement).
The Heska Board may, prior to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval (but not after):
•
with respect to a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of the
non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause
Heska to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to substantially concurrently with such termination
enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Takeover Proposal if and only if, prior to taking
either such action, (i) Heska has complied with its obligations under the non-solicitation provision of the
Merger Agreement (including the notice obligations to Acquiror described below), (ii) the Heska Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (iii) the Heska Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; and
•
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a “Company Intervening Event” which is
defined as any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or combination
thereof (other than (x) the fact that Heska meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts,
estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period, any
changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in the market price or trading volume of Common Stock
(provided that the underlying causes of such fact, to the extent not otherwise excluded from this definition
of “Company Intervening Event,” may be taken into account in determining the existence of a Company
Intervening Event), or (y) any reasonably foreseeable consequence of the announcement of the Merger
Agreement) that was not known to or reasonably expected by the Heska Board as of or prior to the date of
the Merger Agreement and is unrelated to any Company Takeover Proposal or expected receipt of a
Company Takeover Proposal, which we refer to as an “Intervening Event Recommendation Change,” if (i)
Heska has complied with its obligations under the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement
(including the notice obligations to Acquiror described below) and (ii) the Heska Board has determined, in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.
Prior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change, effecting any such termination or making any such
Intervening Event Recommendation Change, (i) Heska must give Acquiror at least five business days’ prior notice of
its intention to do so, the reasons therefor, and certain information related thereto, (ii) Heska must
75
TABLE OF CONTENTS
negotiate in good faith with Acquiror and its representatives to enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of
the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the Heska Board must consider in good faith any revisions to the terms of the Merger
Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror (and not revoked) and determine in good faith after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, either that the Company Takeover Proposal continues to
constitute a Company Takeover Proposal if the revisions proposed by Acquiror were to be given effect, or that the
failure to make an Intervening Event Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the Heska Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, as the case may be. Further, in the event of any change to
the financial terms or other material terms of such Company Takeover Proposal, Heska must give a new notice to
Acquiror consistent with that described in clause (i) above and a new notice period under clause (iii) above will
commence, except that the five business day notice period will instead be the longer of three business days and the
period remaining under the original notice period immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice. Heska is
not permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement under these provisions with respect to a Company Superior
Proposal unless Heska pays Acquiror the Termination Fee (which is described in more detail in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement-Termination Fee” beginning on page 82) prior to or concurrently with such termination.
Access to Information
Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, Heska will, and will cause its subsidiaries to (i) afford Acquiror and
its representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to Heska’s and its subsidiaries’ personnel,
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records (including tax returns), (ii) make available to Acquiror such
other available information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Acquiror may reasonably request
and will instruct Heska’s (and its subsidiaries’) independent accountants to provide access to their work papers and
such other information (including tax returns and drafts of any U.S. federal income tax returns or other material state
or non-U.S. income tax returns) as Acquiror may reasonably request, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with Acquiror,
and use commercially reasonable efforts to, no later than 10 days after the date of the Merger Agreement, provide all
information required under Sec. 20 of the German real estate transfer tax act to Acquiror, in order to ensure that
Acquiror can meet its obligation to file timely notifications for German real estate transfer tax purposes in compliance
with applicable laws, each of (i), (ii) and (iii) other than with respect to any person or information if so doing, in
Heska’s and its outside counsel’s reasonable judgment, would violate any law or contract or jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege; provided, that Heska informs Acquiror of the general nature of such information and reasonably
cooperates with Acquiror to share the information in such a manner that would not result in the violation of law or
contract or loss or waiver of such privilege. Any access or investigation must be conducted so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business and operations of Heska or any of its subsidiaries.
No investigation by Acquiror or its representatives will affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of Heska set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance
All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, and any rights to advancement of expenses in favor of the Company Indemnified Parties, as provided
in the organizational documents of Heska or its subsidiaries existing as of March 31, 2023 or any indemnification
agreements existing as of March 31, 2023 will survive the Merger and may not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror will ensure the Surviving Corporation honors these obligations.
Prior to the Effective Time, at Heska’s option, Heska will, or, if Heska is unable to, Acquiror will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancelable extension of the directors’ and
officers’ liability coverage of Heska’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and Heska’s existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as Heska’s current insurance carrier with respect to such insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
76
TABLE OF CONTENTS
under Heska’s existing policies as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement; provided that Heska (or the
Surviving Corporation) will not pay an amount for such new insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by Heska for such insurance. If such “tail” prepaid policy has been obtained by either Heska or the
Surviving Corporation prior to or as of the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause such policy to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. If
such a “tail” policy cannot be obtained as of the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation is required to
maintain in effect, for a period of not less than six years, Heska’s current directors’ and officers’ fiduciary liability
insurance policies or a comparable policy, subject to certain limitations and minimum standards.
Efforts to Complete the Merger; Regulatory Approvals
The Merger Agreement provides that Heska, Acquiror and Merger Sub will each use their respective reasonable
best efforts to:
•
promptly submit all notifications to and obtain all clearances, authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals of all governmental entities that may be, or become necessary for execution and delivery of, and
the performance of obligations pursuant to, the Merger Agreement;
•
cooperate fully in promptly submitting all notifications and seeking to obtain all such clearances,
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals; and
•
provide any other information any governmental entity may reasonably request in connection with the
Merger Agreement (including requests for additional information or materials under the HSR Act) as
promptly as reasonably practicable.
Under the Merger Agreement, each party is required to (i) promptly, and in no event later than April 14, 2023
(unless otherwise mutually agreed to), make its respective filings pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) as promptly as
practicable, make its respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other applicable antitrust, competition,
foreign investment or trade regulation law, and, in each case, to supply to the appropriate governmental entities as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary materials as may be requested.
Acquiror and Heska (if requested by Acquiror) have agreed to take all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate any
impediment under any antitrust, competition, foreign investment or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any
antitrust or competition governmental entity, so as to enable the parties to close the Merger as promptly as
practicable, including (subject to the next paragraph):
•
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to
the Merger Agreement;
•
entering into such other arrangements as are necessary or advisable to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, that would prevent
the consummation of the Merger; and
•
contesting and defending on the merits any claim asserted by a governmental entity in order to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would prevent the Closing.
Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until
required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and statutory waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. On April 14, 2023, both Heska and Acquiror filed their respective Notification and
Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. The waiting period under the HSR Act is expected to expire on
May 15, 2023 unless earlier terminated or extended by the issuance of a Second Request to the parties by the FTC or
the Antitrust Division prior to that time. If the FTC or the Antitrust Division issues a Second Request, the waiting
period with respect to the Merger will be extended for an additional period of 30 calendar days following both parties’
substantial compliance with that request unless earlier terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division. After that
time, the waiting period may be extended only by court order or with
77
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the consent of the parties. At any time before or after the consummation of any such transactions, the FTC or the
Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws of the United States as it deems necessary or
desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the Merger.
Acquiror and Heska have agreed that Acquiror will control and direct the parties’ filings (including filing timing),
strategies, process, negotiation of settlements (if any) and related proceedings to obtain regulatory approvals (and
Acquiror shall consult with and consider in good faith Heska’s views with regard thereto), and that Acquiror may
take or pursue any reasonable actions or strategies to avoid, resist or reduce the scope of any action sought or
required by governmental entities or pertaining to the submission of all required notices to any governmental entity
and obtaining the consent therefrom, so long as such action or strategy will not delay satisfaction of the closing
conditions past the “Outside Date” as it may be extended to the “Extended Outside Date” or “Further Extended
Outside Date,” as applicable (as such terms are defined in the section entitled “Summary - Termination of the Merger
Agreement” beginning on page 8).
However, none of Mars, Acquiror, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Mars will be required to, and Heska
and its subsidiaries will not without the prior written consent of Mars, take any action, or commit to take any action,
or agree to any condition or limitation contemplated in the antitrust covenant of the Merger Agreement (i) that is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, (ii) with respect to any of Mars’s, Acquiror’s or their respective
subsidiaries operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, contracts, licenses, relationships, contractual rights or
obligations, customers or assets or (iii) that would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of assets, properties or businesses of Heska or any of its subsidiaries and/or the
termination of any business (in any jurisdictions(s)) of Heska or any of its subsidiaries that (x) generated more than
$30,000,000 of annual consolidated revenues of Heska and its subsidiaries in the North America segment (as defined
in Heska’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022) during the 12-month period ending as
of December 31, 2022 or (y) generated more than $30,000,000 of annual consolidated revenues of Heska and its
subsidiaries in the International segment (as defined in Heska’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending
December 31, 2022) during the 12-month period ending as of December 31, 2022 (each of (i), (ii) or (iii), a “Burdensome
Condition”).
Mars, Heska and their respective subsidiaries (including Acquiror and Merger Sub) have agreed not to, prior to
the Closing, acquire any businesses or securities of a third party if such acquisition would, or would reasonably be
expected to, prevent or materially delay the obtaining of necessary regulatory approvals.
Employee Matters
For a period of at least 12 months following the Effective Time, Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall, (i)
provide each employee of Heska or any of its subsidiaries who continues as of the Effective Time to be employed by
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate (which we refer to herein as “continuing employees”) with at least
the same level of base salary or hourly wage rate and target cash bonus opportunity, in each case, that was provided
to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide the continuing employees employee
benefits (excluding equity, compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation, defined benefit pension, post-
employment health and welfare benefit plans and change in control, retention or other non-recurring compensation)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such continuing employees by Heska and
any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) provide each continuing employee who is
terminated without cause with severance benefits and payments as specified in the Company Disclosure Schedules.
At the Effective Time, each continuing employee shall be given service credit for all purposes, including for
eligibility to participate, benefit levels and eligibility for vesting under Acquiror employee benefit plans and
arrangements (which we refer to herein as “Acquiror Benefit Plans”) with respect to his or her length of service with
Heska (and its subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not result in the
duplication of benefits and shall not be recognized with respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan or for any purpose under any long-term incentive plan or post-employment welfare benefit plan.
After the Effective Time, Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause each continuing employee to
be immediately eligible to participate in all Acquiror Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under such benefit plans
replaces coverage under a comparable benefit plan of Heska in which such continuing employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) for purposes of each Acquiror Benefit Plan providing
78
TABLE OF CONTENTS
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any continuing employee and his or her covered
dependents, (A) cause all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and actively at work
requirements of such Acquiror Benefit Plan to be waived to the extent such limitations, exclusions, waiting periods
and actively at work requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable benefit plan of Heska and (B)
recognize any eligible expenses incurred under a benefit plan of Heska during the portion of the plan year prior to the
date such continuing employee becomes eligible to participate in such Acquiror’s benefit plan to be taken into
account under such Acquiror Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and
maximum out of pocket requirements for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such benefit plan of Heska.
Unless otherwise directed by Acquiror prior to the Closing, Heska shall take all actions necessary to terminate
the Company’s tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan (which we refer to herein as the “Heska 401(k)
Plan”), effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing, and contingent upon the occurrence
of the Merger, and provide that participants in the Heska 401(k) Plan shall become fully vested in any unvested
portion of their accounts as of the date such plan is terminated. If the Heska 401(k) Plan is terminated, Acquiror shall
designate a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is sponsored
by Acquiror or one of its subsidiaries that will cover eligible continuing employees effective as of, or as soon as
administratively practicable but no later than 90 days following, the Closing.
As soon as practicable upon or following, and in all events within 60 days following the closing of the Merger,
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall pay each continuing employee eligible to participate in the MIP or any
other annual cash incentive compensation plan a payment equal to such continuing employee’s pro rata target bonus
amount under the MIP or other annual cash incentive compensation plan for the period between January 1, 2023 and
the Closing.
Company Special Meeting
Heska has agreed to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of Heska stockholders for the purpose of
voting upon the Merger Proposal as promptly as practicable following resolution of any SEC comments with respect
to this proxy statement (which Heska was required to use its reasonable best efforts to file by May 1, 2023). Subject
to certain exceptions permitting a delay, Heska must hold a meeting of Heska stockholders for the purpose of voting
on the Merger Proposal on or around the 20th business day following the commencement of the mailing of this proxy

requested by Acquiror and delivering to the trustee, noteholders or other applicable persons any documents or
instruments required by the Convertible Notes Indenture or reasonably requested by Acquiror to be delivered at or
prior to the Effective Time to such trustee, noteholders or other applicable persons. Heska has agreed not to elect any
settlement method pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture that would be applicable to conversions whose
settlement will occur after the Effective Time without Acquiror’s consent.
Certain Additional Covenants
The Merger Agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the
filing of this proxy statement, covenants relating to regulatory filings and approvals (which are described in the
section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) -Regulatory Approvals” beginning on page 64), reporting requirements

agreement in its entirety.
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement on March 31, 2023, Kevin S. Wilson, the Chief
Executive Officer and President of Heska, and David E. Sveen, Ph.D., a member of the Heska Board, each entered into
a Voting Agreement with Acquiror, pursuant to which each of the Wilson Stockholders and each of the Sveen

required to vote: (1) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of other matters that
are required to be approved by Heska stockholders in order to effect the Merger; (2) against approval of
any proposal, including any Company Takeover Proposal, made in opposition to, or in competition or
inconsistent with, consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; (3) against any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or that would
reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere with, delay, postpose, discourage or adversely affect
the Merger or any of the other transactions expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
performance of his, her or its obligations under the Voting Agreement; (4) against any action, proposal,
transaction or agreement that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a breach in any material
respect of any covenant, representation or warranty of any other obligation or agreement of Heska
contained in the Merger Agreement or of himself, herself or itself contained in the Voting Agreement; and
(5) in favor of any other matter necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger;

prohibited from transferring his, her or its shares of Common Stock, subject to limited exceptions described
in the Voting Agreements;

proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger or any Company Takeover Proposal, (2)
initiating, solely in his capacity as a stockholder, a stockholder vote with respect to a Company Takeover
Proposal and (3) becoming a member of a “group” (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) with respect to any voting securities of Heska with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal; and
•
prohibited from exercising any appraisal or dissent rights in connection with the Merger.
In addition, pursuant to the Voting Agreements, each of the Wilson Stockholders and Sveen Stockholders
irrevocably granted a proxy appointing Acquiror and any designee of Acquiror as his, her or its attorney-in-fact and
proxy, with full power of substitution, to vote and otherwise act (including in any action by written consent of Heska
stockholders) with respect to all of the subject shares on the matters and in the manner specified above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing agreements, each of Kevin S. Wilson and David E. Sveen and Acquiror have
agreed that the foregoing obligations will not in any way restrict either Kevin S. Wilson or David E. Sveen,
respectively, from taking any action in his capacity as a director, officer or employee of Heska that is otherwise
permitted to be taken pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The Voting Agreements terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) a termination of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the
mutual written consent of Acquiror and the Wilson Stockholders or the Sveen Stockholders, as applicable, and (iii)
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, (x) the Wilson Stockholders have agreed to vote 482,578 shares of Common Stock, representing 4.42% of
Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, and any shares of Common Stock acquired by the Wilson
Stockholders after March 31, 2023 and (y) the Sveen Stockholders have agreed to vote 43,081 shares of Common
Stock, representing 0.39% of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, and any shares of Common Stock

The following table sets forth information known to Heska regarding the beneficial ownership of Common Stock
as of the Record Date:
•
each person who is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock;
•
each of Heska’s current named executive officers and directors; and
•
all officers and directors of Heska, as a group.
Beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has
beneficial ownership of a security if he, she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that
security, including securities that such he, she or it has the right to acquire within 60 days of a specified date through
(i) the exercise of any option, warrant or right, (ii) the conversion of a security, (iii) the power to revoke a trust,
discretionary account or similar arrangement or (iv) the automatic termination of a trust, discretionary account or
similar arrangement. Except as described in the footnotes below and subject to applicable community property laws
and similar laws, Heska believes that each person listed above has sole voting and investment power with respect to
such shares of Common Stock or Common Stock beneficially owned by them.
The beneficial ownership of Common Stock is based on 10,913,754 shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of the Record Date.

HESKA CORP_20230508_DEFM14A_20858914_4661346.Pdf,THE ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 2),"THE ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL (PROPOSAL 2)
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Heska is asking Heska stockholders to approve, on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may be paid to Heska’s named executive officers in connection
with the Merger as described in the section entitled “The Merger - Interests of Heska’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 57 . Because the vote on the Advisory Compensation Proposal is
advisory only, it will not be binding on Heska, Mars, Acquiror or Merger Sub. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is
approved and the Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation will be payable to Heska’s named executive
officers, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the approval of the Advisory
Compensation Proposal.
Required Vote of Stockholders
The Heska Board unanimously recommends that Heska stockholders vote “FOR” the Advisory Compensation
Proposal. Under the Bylaws, if a quorum is present, approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the
Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, for stockholders of record who are not present in person
or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and for beneficial owners who fail to instruct their bank, broker, trust
or other nominee to vote on any proposal, a failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the Advisory
Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Advisory Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Advisory Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve either
the Merger Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, a Heska stockholder may vote to approve the
Advisory Compensation Proposal and vote not to approve the Merger Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, and
vice versa.
THE HESKA BOARD ACCORDINGLY UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU 
VOTE “FOR” THE ADVISORY COMPENSATION PROPOSAL.

The Special Meeting may be adjourned one or more times to another time and place, if any, including if
necessary, to permit solicitation of additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal
or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is timely provided to Heska stockholders.
Heska is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Heska Board to vote in favor of
any adjournment of the Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies if a quorum is not present, there are not sufficient
votes to approve the Merger Proposal, or to ensure that any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is
timely provided to Heska stockholders.
Required Vote of Stockholders
The Heska Board unanimously recommends that Heska stockholders vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, if
necessary.
Under the Bylaws, if a quorum is present, approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. Accordingly, for stockholders of record who are not present in person or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting and for beneficial owners who fail to instruct their bank, broker, trust or other nominee
to vote on any proposal, a failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Advisory Compensation Proposal.
The vote on the Adjournment Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the Merger
Proposal. Accordingly, a Heska stockholder may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and vote not to approve the
Adjournment Proposal, and vice versa.
THE HESKA BOARD ACCORDINGLY UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU

If the Merger is consummated, a holder of Common Stock who does not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal
and who properly demands appraisal of its shares of Common Stock, who does not effectively withdraw its demand
or waive or lose the right to appraisal, and who otherwise complies with the requirements for perfecting and
preserving appraisal rights, will be entitled to seek appraisal of his, her or its shares in connection with the Merger
under Section 262.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL
and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E.
The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that
a holder of Common Stock exercise its appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of
Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having
a beneficial interest in shares of Common Stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker,
trust or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly
and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a bank, broker,
trust or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker, trust
or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, a holder of shares of Common Stock who (1) does not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal;
(2) continuously is the record holder of such shares from the date of the making of the demand through the effective
date of the Merger; and (3) otherwise follows the procedures set forth in Section 262, may be entitled to have its
shares of Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair
value” of the shares of Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid, if any, on the amount determined to be fair value, as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The “fair value” of the shares of Common Stock as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery may be more than, the same as, or less than the per share consideration of the
stockholders are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption and approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled
to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy
statement constitutes notice to holders of Common Stock that appraisal rights are available in connection with the
Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E. In connection with the
Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve
such holder’s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully and consult with legal advisors. Failure to strictly
comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights
under the DGCL. A holder of Common Stock who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures
for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Common Stock, the Company encourages a stockholder
considering exercising such rights to seek the advice of legal counsel.
A stockholder wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of its shares of Common Stock must do ALL of
the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Heska a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger
Proposal at the Special Meeting and be a stockholder of record at the time of the making of such demand;
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Common Stock from the date of making the demand
through the effective date of the Merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers
the shares before the effective date of the Merger); and
89TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
a stockholder of record, a beneficial owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded
appraisal or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a
determination of the fair value of the shares of Common Stock within 120 days after the effective date of the
Merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition and has no intention of
doing so. Accordingly, it is the stockholder’s obligation to initiate all necessary action to perfect his, her or
its appraisal rights in respect of his, her or its shares of Common Stock within the time prescribed in Section
262.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger
Proposal, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against or abstain
from voting on the Merger Proposal or not vote their shares.
Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Heska, before the
vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting at which the Merger Proposal will be submitted to the
stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares of Common Stock. A holder of shares of
Common Stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal
is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the Merger. A proxy that is
submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal,
and it will result in the stockholder’s loss of appraisal rights and will nullify any previously delivered written demand
for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit
a proxy containing instructions to vote against or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal. Neither voting against
the Merger Proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal will, in and of itself,
constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal
must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal. A stockholder’s failure to make
the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting will result in a loss
of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder’s name on the date the written demand is made. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares
of Common Stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Heska of
the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares of
Common Stock in connection with the Merger. If the shares of Common Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary
capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record
owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,
the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized
agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the
agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is
acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
A STOCKHOLDER WHO HOLDS ITS SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS, TRUST OR OTHER
NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH ITS
BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE
PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR
APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD
IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT
PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE
STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of Common Stock as a
nominee for others may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to shares of Common Stock held for one
or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand
should state the number of shares of Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of
Common Stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares

TABLE OF CONTENTS
of Common Stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds shares of Common Stock through a
broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand
for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the
depository nominee as record owner.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
Heska Corporation
3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue
Loveland, Colorado 80538
Attn: Corporate Secretary
At any time within 60 days of the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who has
demanded appraisal but has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement
by delivering to Heska a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the
demand made more than 60 days after the effective date of the Merger will require written approval of the Surviving
Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of
the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal
when that approval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal
proceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value of his, her or its shares of Common
Stock determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value may be more than, the same as, or less than the
Merger Consideration.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective date of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will
notify each holder of shares of Common Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262,
and who has not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date
thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation, a beneficial
owner of shares as to which the record holder has duly demanded appraisal or any record holder of shares of
Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the
Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of
the shares of Common Stock held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving
Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Common
Stock. Accordingly, any holder of shares of Common Stock who desires to have its shares appraised should initiate
all necessary action to perfect its appraisal rights in respect of its shares of Common Stock within the time and in the
manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Common Stock to file such a petition within the period
specified in Section 262 could nullify the holder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of Common Stock who has complied
with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon request given in writing, to receive from
the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which Heska has received demands for appraisal,
and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the
requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the request for such a statement or within 10 days after the
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of
Common Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own
name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted
above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
91
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Common Stock and a copy thereof is served
upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to
file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders
who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not
been reached. After notice to the stockholders who have demanded appraisal and the Surviving Corporation, if such
notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded
payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court
of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. In addition, because the Common Stock is publicly
listed on the NASDAQ (and we do not expect this to change prior to the Merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery
will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares of Common Stock who are otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of such shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock or (y) the value of consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares
exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
appraise the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any
rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the “fair value” of the Common Stock as of the effective date of the Merger after taking into account all
relevant factors exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. When the fair value has
been determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued
during the pendency of the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, by the Surviving
Corporation to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon surrender by those stockholders of the
Certificates representing their shares of Common Stock or, in the case of holders of uncertificated shares of Common
Stock, forthwith. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will
accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the
entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided in the preceding sentence only
upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of shares as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In
Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather
applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,
the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.”
A stockholder considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of its shares of Common Stock
as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as, or less than the
92
TABLE OF CONTENTS
consideration it would receive pursuant to the Merger if it did not seek appraisal of its shares and that an opinion of
an investment banking firm as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration payable in a
Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Heska
believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair
value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal
could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither
Heska nor Mars anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal
rights, and each of Heska and Mars reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of
Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Common Stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for
appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do
not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances.
Each stockholder seeking appraisal is responsible for his, her or its attorneys’ fees and expert witness expenses,
although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to
be appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock under Section 262 fails to
perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of Common
Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective date of the Merger into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if,
among other things, no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger or if the
stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262 within 60 days of the effective date of the
Merger or thereafter with the written approval of Heska.
From and after the effective date of the Merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be
entitled to vote such shares of Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of Common Stock, if any,
payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the effective date of the Merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or
if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the written
approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition
for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as
to any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval
of the court. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a
stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. In view of the complexity of Section 262, any stockholder wishing to exercise
appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights. To the extent there
are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262, Section 262 will govern.

Heska held its 2023 annual meeting of stockholders on May 3, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Meeting”). Heska will
only hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2024 if the Merger is not completed before such meeting. If the
Merger is not completed, Heska stockholders may submit proposals for consideration at the Heska 2024 annual
meeting of stockholders (the “Heska 2024 Annual Meeting”).
For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in Heska’s proxy statement for the Heska 2024 Annual
Meeting, the written proposal must be received by Heska’s Corporate Secretary at Heska’s principal executive offices
under either (1) Rule 14a-8 (a “Rule 14 Proposal”) under the Exchange Act, or (2) the Bylaws (a “Bylaws Proposal”). A
Rule 14 Proposal must be received by Heska’s Corporate Secretary at Heska’s principal executive offices no later than
November 22, 2023.
If the date of the Heska 2024 Annual Meeting is moved more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of
the 2023 Annual Meeting, the deadline for inclusion of proposals in Heska’s proxy statement is instead a reasonable
period of time before Heska begins to print and mail its proxy materials. Such proposals will also need to comply with
Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy
materials. For a Bylaws Proposal, the stockholder must deliver a written notice of intent to propose such action in
accordance with the Bylaws, which in general require that the notice be received by us not less than 60 days nor
more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which notice of the prior year’s annual meeting was
mailed to stockholders. The proxy materials for the 2023 Annual Meeting were mailed on about March 21, 2023. This
means that for the Heska 2024 Annual Meeting, any such proposal must be received no earlier than December 22,
2023 and no later than January 21, 2024.
You may propose Director candidates for consideration by Heska Board’s Corporate Governance Committee.
Any such recommendations should be directed to Heska’s Corporate Secretary at Heska’s principal executive offices.
In addition, you may nominate a Director for consideration by Heska’s stockholders if you give timely and adequate
notice to Heska’s Corporate Secretary of your intention to make such nomination in accordance with the Bylaws,
which require that the notice be received by the Corporate Secretary within the time periods for a Bylaws Proposal
described above and with the detail regarding your nomination as is required by the Bylaws. In addition to satisfying
the deadlines in the advance notice provisions of the Bylaws, a stockholder who intends to solicit proxies in support
of nominees submitted under these advance notice provisions must provide the notice required under Rule 14a-19 to
Heska’s Corporate Secretary no later than March 4, 2024.

parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart.
Section 5.10 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof,
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that
will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.
Section 5.11 Remedies.
(a) Generally. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon
a party hereto will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law
or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.
(b) Specific Performance. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any
such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by Stockholder, on the one hand, or Acquiror, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Stockholder, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement.

respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other party hereto in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and (b) this Agreement is not
intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder.
Section 5.14 Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Acquiror
any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Company Shares beneficially
owned by Stockholder. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to such Company Shares shall
remain vested in and belong to Stockholder, and the Acquiror shall not have any authority to direct Stockholder in
the voting or disposition of such Company Shares except as otherwise provided herein.

Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Heska Corporation (“Heska”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as

share, of Heska (“Heska Common Stock”) (other than any shares of Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled Shares,

(3)

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Heska Common

of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.
In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:

(7)
reviewed a draft, dated March 31, 2023 of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
(8)
performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we
deemed appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed
by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the management of Heska that they are
C-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any
material respect. With respect to the Heska Forecasts, we have been advised by Heska, and have assumed, that they
have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments
of the management of Heska as to the future financial performance of Heska. We have not made or been provided
with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Heska or any
other entity, nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Heska or any other entity. We
have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of Heska, Acquiror, Mars or any other entity under any state, federal or
other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed, at the direction of Heska, that the
Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material
term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other
approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any
divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on
Heska or any other entity or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. We also have assumed, at the direction of
Heska, that that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement
reviewed by us.
We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the Merger (other than the Consideration to the
extent expressly specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any terms,
aspects or implications of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or
related to the Merger or otherwise. As you are aware, we were not requested to, and we did not, solicit indications of
interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all or any part of Heska or any alternative
transaction. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be received
by holders of Heska Common Stock (other than holders of Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled Shares, Dissenting
Shares and Remainder Shares) and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in
connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party.
In addition, no opinion or view is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature
or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or
class of such persons, relative to the Consideration. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative
merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to Heska or in which
Heska might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Heska to proceed with or effect the Merger. In
addition, we are not expressing any view or opinion with respect to, and we have relied, with the consent of Heska,
upon the assessments of Heska and its representatives regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar
matters relating to Heska or any other entity and the Merger (including the contemplated benefits thereof) as to
which we understand that Heska obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. We
further express no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the
Merger or any related matter.
We have acted as financial advisor to Heska in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a
portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon
consummation of the Merger. In addition, Heska has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against
certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
We and our affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities
and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing
investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and financial advisory
services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies, governments and individuals. In

of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Heska Common
Stock (other than holders of Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares and Remainder Shares)
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

the merger (the “Merger”) of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, pursuant to which each outstanding share
of Company Common Stock, other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock (A) owned or held in treasury by the
Company, (B) held by any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company or (C) held by Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(including Acquiror and its subsidiaries), or (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement) (together, (i) and (ii),

Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par

California corporation, (“Acquiror”), Helsinki Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror (“Merger Sub”), and, solely for the purposes of Section 9.15 of the
Agreement, Mars, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“Parent”). The Agreement provides for, among other things,
the merger (the “Merger”) of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, pursuant to which each outstanding share
of Company Common Stock, other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock (A) owned or held in treasury by the
Company, (B) held by any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company or (C) held by Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(including Acquiror and its subsidiaries), or (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement) (together, (i) and (ii),

In arriving at our opinion, we have: (i) reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of a copy dated March 31, 2023 of

the Company which was publicly available; (iii) reviewed and analyzed certain information, including financial

certain other companies deemed by us to be comparable to the Company; (vi) compared the financial performance of
the Company with that of certain other publicly-traded companies that we deemed relevant; and (vii) reviewed the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions that we deemed
relevant. In addition, we have conducted such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other
financial, economic and market criteria as we have deemed necessary in arriving at our opinion.
We have relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made
available, to us or discussed with or reviewed by us. We have further relied upon the assurances of the management
of the Company that the financial information provided has been prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with
industry practice, and that they are not aware of any information or facts that would make any information provided

verification, that (i) the representations and warranties of all parties to the Agreement and all other related documents
and instruments that are referred to therein are true and correct, (ii) each party to such agreements will fully and
timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party, (iii) the Merger will be
consummated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement without amendments thereto and (iv) all conditions to the
consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver by any party of any conditions or obligations
thereunder. Additionally, we have assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and consents required for the
Merger will be obtained in a manner that will not adversely affect the Company or the contemplated benefits of the
Merger.
In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities
(fixed, contingent or other) of the Company, and have not been furnished or provided with any such appraisals or
valuations, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company under any state or federal law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. The analyses performed by us in connection with this opinion were going
concern analyses. We express no opinion regarding the liquidation value of the Company or any other entity.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have undertaken no independent analysis of any pending or
threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which the
Company or any of its affiliates is a party or may be subject, and, at the direction of the Company and with its
consent, our opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the possible assertion of
claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. We have also assumed that neither the Company nor
the Acquiror is party to any material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing, recapitalization,
acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the Merger.
This opinion is necessarily based upon the information available to us and facts and circumstances as they exist and
are subject to evaluation on the date hereof; events occurring after the date hereof could materially affect the
assumptions used in preparing this opinion. We are not expressing any opinion herein as to the price at which shares
of Company Common Stock may trade following announcement of the Merger or at any future time. We have not
undertaken to reaffirm or revise this opinion or otherwise comment upon any events occurring after the date hereof
and do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have not been requested to, and did not, (i) participate in negotiations with respect to the Agreement, (ii) solicit
any expressions of interest from any other parties with respect to any business combination with the Company or
any other alternative transaction, or (iii) advise the Board of Directors or any other party with respect to alternatives
to the Merger.
We have been engaged by the Company to act as its financial advisor and we will receive a fee from the Company for
providing our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. We will
also receive a fee for rendering this opinion. Our opinion fee is not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger
or the conclusions reached in our opinion. The Company has also agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities
and reimburse us for certain expenses in connection with our services. We have, in the past, provided financial
advisory and financing services to the Company for which we have received fees. In particular, since January 1, 2020,
we acted as (i) financial advisor to the Company in connection with its acquisition of scil animal care company GmbH
in April 2020 and (ii) an underwriter in connection with the Company’s follow-on public offering in March 2021 and
have received fees for such services. We may, in the future, provide financial advisory and financing services to the
Company and its affiliates and may receive fees for the rendering of such services. In the ordinary course of our
business, we and our affiliates may actively trade securities of the Company and the Acquiror for our own account or
the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. We
may also, in the future, provide investment banking and financial advisory services to the Company, the Acquiror or
entities that are affiliated with the Company or the Acquiror, for which we would expect to receive compensation.
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Piper Sandler has adopted policies and procedures to
establish and maintain the independence of Piper Sandler’s Research Department and personnel. As a result, Piper
Sandler’s research analysts may hold opinions, make statements or recommendations, and/or publish research
reports with respect to the Company, the Acquiror, the Merger and other participants in the Merger that differ from

This opinion is provided solely for the benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its
consideration of the Merger and is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any

stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should act or vote with respect to the Merger or any other
matter. Except with respect to the use of this opinion in connection with the proxy statement relating to the Merger in
accordance with our engagement letter with the Company, this opinion shall not be disclosed, referred to, published
or otherwise used (in whole or in part), nor shall any public references to us be made, without our prior written
approval. This opinion has been approved for issuance by the Piper Sandler Opinion Committee.
This opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company Common Stock of
the proposed Merger Consideration set forth in the Agreement and does not address any other terms or agreement
relating to the Merger or any other terms of the Agreement. We were not requested to opine as to, and this opinion
does not address, the basic business decision to proceed with or effect the Merger, the merits of the Merger relative
to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to the Company, Acquiror’s ability to fund
the Merger Consideration, any other terms contemplated by the Agreement or the fairness of the Merger to any other
class of securities, creditor or other constituency of the Company. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect
to the amount or nature of compensation to any officer, director or employee of any party to the Merger, or any class
of such persons, relative to the compensation to be received by holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger or
with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other factors as we consider relevant, it is our
opinion that the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common
Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) as of the date hereof.
Sincerely,

delivered, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

similar provisions to the extent necessary to permit a person or group to make, on a confidential basis to the
Company Board of Directors, a Company Takeover Proposal, conditioned upon such person agreeing to
disclosure of such Company Takeover Proposal to Acquiror, in each case as contemplated by this Section 6.3
(provided, further, that the Company may only take such action if the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure of the
Company Board of Directors to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law). None of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall enter into any
confidentiality agreement or other agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries from (x) providing to Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or Representatives the information
required to be provided pursuant to this Section 6.3 or (y) otherwise complying with this Section 6.3. The
Company and Acquiror hereby agree that all standstill or similar provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall, as of the date of this Agreement, terminate and be of no further force and effect.
(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly after the date hereof request any
person that has executed a currently in-effect confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement after January 1, 2020,
and in connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal to promptly after the date of such
request return or destroy all confidential information in the possession of such person or its Representatives
(other than from any person with which the Company has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
and, prior to the date of the earlier of (x) the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and (y) the return or
destruction of such information, enters into negotiations or discussions regarding any Company Takeover
Proposal in accordance with this Section 6.3 other than as a result of any breach of this Section 6.3 by the
Company).
(c) Anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.3(a) notwithstanding, if at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the
Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal
from any person that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.3 and if the Company Board of Directors
determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior
Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval
is obtained, but not after, (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal;
provided that the Company, to the extent permitted under applicable Law (including any applicable Antitrust
Law), shall concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to Acquiror any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously provided or made available to
Acquiror (which non-public information, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Clean Room Agreement, and may, in order to comply with applicable Law, be restricted to
certain designated Representatives of Acquiror) and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) notify Acquiror if the Company Board of Directors makes a determination that a Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal or if
the Company furnishes information or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided in this Section 6.3(c).

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) notify Acquiror in the event that the Company or any of its Representatives
receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a request for information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries
that constitutes or contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person making the
Company Takeover Proposal and a description of the material terms and conditions thereof. The Company shall
keep Acquiror reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, as to the status of (including any
developments, discussions or negotiations) such Company Takeover Proposal (including by as promptly as

manner adverse to Acquiror, the Company Recommendation or (C) adopt, approve or recommend to
stockholders of the Company, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to adopt, approve or
recommend to stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or
agreement in principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 6.3(c)) (a “Company Acquisition
Agreement”).
(f) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to the time that the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board of Directors may, with respect to
a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.3, make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1(g) in order to substantially concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement
relating to such Company Takeover Proposal if and only if, prior to taking either such action, (i) the Company
has complied with its obligations under this Section 6.3, (ii) the Company Board of Directors has determined, in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company Board of Directors
determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided that prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change or effecting such termination (and prior to
making the determination set forth in clause (iii)), (A) the Company has given Acquiror at least five (5) Business
Days’ prior notice of its intention to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such Company Takeover Proposal and has
contemporaneously provided to Acquiror a copy of the Company Takeover Proposal and a copy of any
proposed Company Acquisition Agreements and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto (or, in
each case, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the material terms and conditions
thereof), (B) the Company shall have negotiated, in good faith, with Acquiror and its Representatives during
such notice period (if, and to the extent, Acquiror has indicated its desire to negotiate to the Company) to
enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company
Takeover Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) following the end of such notice
period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered, in good faith, any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror (and not revoked), and shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Company Takeover Proposal
would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in writing by
Acquiror (and not revoked) were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change to any of the financial
terms (including the form, amount, mix and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of
such Company Takeover Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Acquiror an additional
notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice period

in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (x) three (3) Business Days and (y) the
period remaining under the notice period under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of
such additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with
the requirements of this Section 6.3(f) anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A)
through (D) above of this proviso; provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.3(f) and Section 8.1(g) unless the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Acquiror
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(c) prior to or concurrently with such termination. Anything to the
contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any
Company Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been, or is substantially concurrently, terminated
in accordance with its terms.

any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, but not after, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event
(a “Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change”) if (i) the Company has complied with its obligations
under this Section 6.3 and (ii) prior to taking such action, the Company Board of Directors has determined, in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided that prior to making such Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has
given Acquiror at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and
specifying the reasons therefor, including specifying in reasonable detail the applicable Company Intervening
Event, (B) the Company shall have negotiated, in good faith, with Acquiror and its Representatives during such
notice period to enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (if, and to the extent,

the Company Board of Directors shall have considered, in good faith, any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror (and not revoked), and shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company
Intervening Event Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of
termination of the applicable Continuing Employee), Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
(i) provide each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who continues as of the Effective Time to
be employed by Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Acquiror (each, a “Continuing
Employee”) with at least the same level of base salary or hourly wage rate, as the case may be, and target cash
bonus opportunity, in each case, that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) provide the Continuing Employees with employee benefits (excluding equity, compensation,
non-qualified deferred compensation, defined benefit pension, post-employment health and welfare benefit
plans and change in control, retention or other non-recurring compensation) that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing
A-48TABLE OF CONTENTS
Employee by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the
foregoing exclusions), and (iii) provide each Continuing Employee who is terminated without cause with the
severance benefits and payments set forth on Section 6.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
(b) At the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for all purposes,
including for eligibility to participate, benefit levels and eligibility for vesting under Acquiror employee benefit
plans and arrangements (collectively, the “Acquiror Benefit Plans”) with respect to his or her length of service
with the Company (and its Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing Date; provided that the foregoing
shall not result in the duplication of benefits; provided, further, that the foregoing shall not be recognized with
respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or for any purpose under any long-term
incentive plan or post-employment welfare benefit plan.
(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Effective Time Acquiror shall
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Acquiror Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under such Acquiror
Benefit Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of each Acquiror Benefit Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee from and after the Effective
Time, (A) cause all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and actively at work
requirements of such Acquiror Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods or actively at work
requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Benefit Plan and (B) recognize, or cause
to be recognized, any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the date such Continuing
Employee becomes eligible to participate in such Acquiror Benefit Plan to be taken into account under such
Acquiror Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out of
pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Acquiror Benefit Plan.
(d) Unless other directed by Acquiror at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company’s tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k)
retirement plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”), or cause such plan to be terminated, effective as of no later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, and
provide that participants in the Company 401(k) Plan shall become fully vested in any unvested portion of their
Company 401(k) Plan accounts as of the date such plan is terminated. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated,
the Company shall provide Acquiror with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective
no later than immediately prior to the Closing Date and contingent on the Closing) pursuant to resolutions of
the Company, which such resolutions shall be provided to Acquiror at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and shall be subject to Acquiror’s review and comment. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated,
Acquiror shall designate a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement
that is sponsored by Acquiror or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Acquiror 401(k) Plan”) that will cover eligible
Continuing Employees effective as of, or as soon as administratively practicable but no later than ninety (90)
days following, the Closing Date; provided, that the Company reasonably cooperates in facilitating
administrative payroll and recordkeeping matters. In connection with the termination of the Company 401(k)
Plan, Acquiror shall cause the Acquiror 401(k) Plan to accept from the Company 401(k) Plan the “direct rollover”
of the account balance (including, subject to the next sentence, the in-kind rollover of promissory notes
evidencing all outstanding loans) of each Continuing Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan as
of the date such plan is terminated and who elects such direct rollover in accordance with the terms of the
Company 401(k) Plan and the Code. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to work with the Company 401(k)
Plan and Acquiror 401(k) Plan recordkeepers to develop a process and procedure for effecting the in-kind direct
rollover of promissory notes evidencing participant loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Acquiror 401(k)
Plan. In the event that a process and procedure acceptable to the Company 401(k) Plan and Acquiror 401(k) Plan

any and all commercially reasonable actions needed to permit each Continuing Employee with an outstanding
loan balance under the Company 401(k)

loans.

eligible to participate in the Company’s Management Incentive Plan or any other annual cash incentive

following, and in all events within 60 days following, the Closing Date.

for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto, and that nothing in this Section 6.4, whether express or implied, (i) shall
create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other person, including any employees or former
employees of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), (ii) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Company Benefit Plan or Acquiror Benefit Plan, or (iii) shall limit the right of Acquiror or its Affiliates (including,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company
Benefit Plan or Acquiror Benefit Plan. The Company will notify Acquiror of receipt of any notice of resignation
of a Company Associate within five (5) days of receipt thereof.

(20th) Business Day following the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders.
Except as expressly permitted by Section 6.3, the Company Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall
not make any Adverse Recommendation Change and, unless the Company shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change if, and to the extent, permitted by this Agreement, shall include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Special Meeting.
(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Acquiror informed on a reasonably current basis
regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting only (i) if, as of the time
which the Company Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Special Meeting or to the extent that at such time the
Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) to allow
time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Company
Board of Directors has determined, in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, is
necessary or required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law, the Company Certificate or the
Company Bylaws or (iii) with the prior written consent of Acquiror; provided, however, that any such
adjournment or postponement shall be for not more than the amount of time, in the reasonable judgment of the

Company Bylaws, and, in any event, shall not be to a date that is later than 10 Business Days after the date for
which the Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled. Any additional postponements or
adjournments shall be by mutual agreement of Acquiror and the Company. In no event will the record date of the

there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to adopt this Agreement to allow
reasonable time for the solicitation of proxies for the purposes of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval.
During any such period of adjournment or postponement, the Company shall continue to comply with its
obligations under Section 6.3 and this Section 6.6. Without the prior written consent of Acquiror, the adoption
of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable
Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Special Meeting.
(d) The Company shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with Delaware Law, and unless the Company Board of Directors has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure Company Stockholder

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, and any rights to advancement of expenses, existing as of the date hereof in favor of any
person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, together with their respective heirs,
executors and administrators, the “Company Indemnified Parties”) as provided in the Company Organizational
Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents in effect as of the date hereof) or any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof (and provided to Acquiror), shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time of such
Company Indemnified Parties. From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall ensure that the Surviving
Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.
(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each Company Indemnified Party against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or Liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the

director or officer, and pertaining to matters existing or occurring or actions or omissions taken prior to or at the
Effective Time, including with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, in each case, to the fullest extent
permitted by the Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents), and
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses
to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by the Company Organizational
Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents, as applicable); provided that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by a final and non-appealable judicial determination that such Company Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.9 or otherwise. Neither Acquiror nor the Surviving
Corporation shall, without the prior written consent of the applicable Company Indemnified Party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, for which such Company Indemnified Party would reasonably be expected to be
entitled to indemnification hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) does not require such
Company Indemnified Party to perform any covenant or refrain from engaging in any activity and (ii) does not
include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, violation, culpability, malfeasance or nonfeasance by, or
on behalf of, such Company Indemnified Party. Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall provide the
applicable Company Indemnified Party with the opportunity to participate in the defense of any matter for which
such Company Indemnified Party would reasonably be expected to be entitled to indemnification hereunder.
Acquiror’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under this Section 6.9(b) shall continue in full force and
effect for the period beginning upon the Effective Time and ending six (6) years from the Effective Time;
provided

that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, at the Company’s option, the Company shall, or, if the Company is unable
to, Acquiror shall, cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium
for the non-cancelable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing
directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and the Company’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the “D&O Insurance”), in each case with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time and for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage
provided under the Company’s existing policies as in effect as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however,
that the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) shall not pay an amount for the D&O Insurance
in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance for the policy period that includes the date of this Agreement. If such “tail” prepaid policy has been
obtained by either the Company or the Surviving Corporation prior to or as of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder
to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to
obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the D&O Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with the Company’s current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Company’s existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) Acquiror will provide, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Company Indemnified Parties who are insured under the Company’s D&O Insurance with comparable D&O
Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger)
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier, that is
no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company as of the date of this Agreement or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Acquiror and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for the D&O Insurance in excess
of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance for
the policy period that includes the date of this Agreement; provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger), for a cost not exceeding such amount.

each of the Company Indemnified Parties, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents), by
Contract or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the Effective
Time, no Party shall amend, or seek to amend, this Section 6.9 (except to the extent such amendment permits the
Company to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis to the Company Indemnified Parties).
(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties

amount that will compensate the other Party in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee or Reverse
Termination Fee is due and payable, and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Each of the Company and Acquiror acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, the other
Party would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a Party fails to pay in a timely manner any amount
due pursuant to this Section 8.3, then (i) such Party shall reimburse the payee Party or its designee for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable disbursements and fees of outside legal counsel) incurred
in the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any related claims, actions or
proceedings commenced and (ii) such Party shall pay to the payee Party or its designee interest on such amount
from and including the date payment of such amount was due but excluding the date of actual payment at the
prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus
two percent (2.00%).

Sub’s representations, warranties or covenants herein), subject to any and all limitations on Acquiror’s and
Merger Sub’s covenants, agreements and other obligations hereunder.
(b) This Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collection, and Parent

Acquiror’s and Merger Sub’s and/or their respective designees’ or assigns’ Liabilities (other than in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will affect the
continuing validity and enforceability of this Guaranty. Parent hereby waives (i) any right to require the
Company, as a condition of payment or performance by Parent of any obligations of Acquiror or Merger Sub
hereunder, to proceed against Acquiror or Merger Sub or pursue any other remedy whatsoever in the event that
Acquiror or Merger Sub fails to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by Law which limit the liability of
or exonerate guarantors or sureties.

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to execute and deliver this Guaranty, and to perform its obligations
hereunder, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Guaranty have been approved by all
requisite corporate action, and (iii) no other action on the part of Parent is necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance by Parent of this Guaranty. Except for the representations and warranties of Parent
expressly set forth in this Section 9.15(c) and of Acquiror and Merger Sub expressly set forth in Article V, or in a
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, none of Parent, Acquiror, Merger Sub or any other person on
behalf of Parent, Acquiror or Merger Sub makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect
to Parent, Acquiror, Merger Sub or with respect to any other information provided to the Company or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
(d) Without limiting in any way the foregoing Guaranty, but subject in all respects to any and all
limitations on Acquiror’s and Merger Sub’s covenants, agreements and other obligations hereunder, Parent
agrees to cause, and to take all actions to enable, Acquiror and Merger Sub to adhere to each provision of the
Agreement which requires an act or omission on the part of Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates to cause or enable Acquiror and Merger Sub to comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement.
