In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, at the OpCo Merger Effective Time:

If, between March 1, 2023 and the Closing, the number of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock
or equity interests of OpCo changes into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange (other than
pursuant to any Rollover Agreement) of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and the cash
amounts owed in respect of Company equity awards as described under the section of the proxy statement

adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or

Right will be accelerated to the first payroll date after the date of such termination; and
each share of Company Restricted Stock held by a non-employee director of the Company Board that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, will vest (to the extent unvested) and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash
payment, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration.
With respect to Company Stock Options and LTIP Units granted to employees of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries following the date of the Merger Agreement, such equity awards will generally be canceled
as of the Company Merger Effective Time or OpCo Merger Effective Time, as applicable, and converted into a
right to receive a cash payment, without interest, based on the Merger Consideration (less the applicable
exercise price and with all performance conditions deemed satisfied), except that such amount will vest and
become payable subject to and in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding
Company equity award immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or OpCo Merger Effective
Time, as applicable, and otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as such corresponding
Company equity award (each, a “Post-Signing Award Payment Right”); provided that, if the employment of a
holder of such Post-Signing Award Payment Right is terminated following the Company Merger Effective
Time or OpCo Merger Effective Time, as applicable, but prior to the applicable vesting date by Parent without
Cause (as defined in the Company Stock Plan) or due to death or Disability (as defined in the Company Stock

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers (page 98)
The receipt of cash pursuant to the Company Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if you are a holder of common stock
who is a U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers”), you will
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash you receive in the
Company Merger and your adjusted tax basis in your shares of Company Common Stock converted into cash
in the Company Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you are a holder of Company Common Stock who is a non-U.S. holder (as defined below in the section
of this proxy statement titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers”), the Company Merger will generally not be taxable to you under
U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections to the United States or we are or have been
a United States real property holding corporation and certain other conditions are met.
You should read the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers” beginning on page 98 for a
more complete discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Company Merger. You
should consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of how the Mergers will affect your U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes in light of your particular circumstances.
Litigation Related to the Mergers (page 93)
On April 4, 2023, the Company received a demand letter from Norfolk County Retirement System, a
purported holder of shares of Class A Common Stock, requesting access to certain books and records of the
Company to investigate purported breaches of fiduciary duty, director independence and disinterestedness
and/or other corporate wrongdoing in connection with the Mergers and related transaction documents. On
April 14, 2023, the Company responded to this demand letter by denying the allegations contained therein
and objecting to such purported stockholder's scope of requests but indicating a proper inspection of books
and records would be permitted, subject to negotiation of an appropriate scope of production and execution
of a standard confidentiality agreement.
Between April 7, 2023 and May 1, 2023, three complaints were filed in connection with the Mergers. On
April 7, 2023, a complaint, captioned Ryan O’Dell v. Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. et al., 23-cv-2956
(S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported
holder of shares of Class A Common Stock; on April 12, 2023, a complaint, captioned Elaine Wang v. Radius
Global Infrastructure, Inc. et al., 23-cv-3068 (S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York by a purported holder of shares of Class A Common Stock; and on May 1,
2023, a complaint, captioned Shannon Jenkins v. Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. et al., 23-cv-3657
(S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported
holder of shares of Class A Common Stock; all three cases named as defendants the Company and members
of the Company Board. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants caused to be filed
with the SEC a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement relating to the Mergers in
violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Among
other remedies, the complaints seek: an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Mergers
unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted
from the preliminary proxy statement; rescinding the Merger Agreement or any of the terms thereof to the
extent already implemented or granting rescissory damages; awarding the plaintiffs the costs and
disbursements of their actions, including reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses; and granting
such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The Company has not yet formally
responded to these complaints, but believes that the allegations contained therein are without merit.
On April 17, 2023, the Company received two demand letters from purported holders of shares of Class
A Common Stock and, on April 19, 2023, the Company received a third demand letter from a purported holder
of shares of Class A Common Stock; all three letters alleged disclosure deficiencies in the preliminary proxy
statement and demanded issuance of corrective disclosures. The Company has not yet formally responded
to these demand letters, but believes that the allegations contained therein are without merit.
As of May 9, 2023, the Company was not aware of the filing of other lawsuits or the submission of other
demand letters challenging the Mergers and/or alleging deficiencies with respect to the preliminary proxy
statement; however, such lawsuits or demand letters may be filed or submitted, respectively, in the future.
Appraisal Rights (page 94)
If the Mergers are consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Capital Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL and, if all
procedures described in Section 262 of the DGCL are strictly complied with, to receive payment in
8 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
cash for the fair value of their shares of Company Capital Stock exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the Mergers, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of
your shares of Company Capital Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less
than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger
Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL will not receive the Merger
Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an
amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company Capital Stock following petition to, and an
appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair
value of their shares of Company Capital Stock determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the
same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to comply
strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of
appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, persons
wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to
exercise such rights.
A holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Company Capital Stock who (a) continuously holds
such shares through the Company Merger Effective Time, (b) has not consented to or otherwise voted in
favor of the Mergers or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (c) strictly complies with the
procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL, (d) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for
appraisal of such shares and (e) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (i) reasonably identifies in
his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (ii) provides
documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such
documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (iii) provides an address at
which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the
Chancery List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement -  Appraisal Rights”), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company
Capital Stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Mergers, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value.
A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following
publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The foregoing
summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to Section 262 of the DGCL and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement.
Any person who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the
DGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such
rights. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement - Appraisal Rights”.

proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”), each requires the affirmative vote of
a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Recommendation of the Company Board (page 32)
The Company Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction Committee, has
unanimously: (a) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (b) duly authorized and approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation by
the Company of such transactions, (c) declared the Merger Agreement and such transactions are advisable
and (d) recommended that the Company Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Prior to the Special Meeting, under certain circumstances, the Company Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - 
Change in Company Board Recommendation”) in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Change in Company Board
Recommendation”) or in connection with a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement titled “The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation”).
However, the Company Board cannot make an Adverse Recommendation Change unless it complies
with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including (a) giving Parent at least four business days’
prior written notice (subject to extension in certain circumstances) of its intention to take such action, (b)
during such four-business day period, negotiating with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to propose in
writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that it would cause
such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (c) following the end of such four-
business day period, the Company Board again determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) (i) that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the proposed
revisions in such binding offer were to be given effect and (ii) that the failure of the Company Board to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties to the
Company or Company Stockholders under applicable law. The termination of the Merger Agreement (x) by
Parent in the event of (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) the Company or any of its affiliates
entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement or (y) by Radius (prior to receipt of Company Stockholder
Approval) to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate a Superior Proposal, in each case of clauses (x)
and (y), will result in the payment by Radius of a termination fee of $52,000,000 (the “Company Termination
Fee”). Radius will also be required to pay the Company Termination Fee in additional circumstances that
involve a Takeover Proposal being made prior to certain terminations of the Merger Agreement and Radius
subsequently consummating a Takeover Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Change in Company Board Recommendation”.

Board requested that Citi evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of
Class A Common Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On March 1, 2023, at a meeting of the
Company Board held to evaluate the proposed Mergers, Citi rendered to the Company Board an oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the effect that, as of the
date of Citi’s written opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi as set forth in its
written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock

to holders of shares of Class A Common Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Citi’s opinion did not
address any other terms, aspects or implications of the proposed Mergers. Citi’s opinion did not address the
underlying business decision of the Company to effect or enter into the proposed Mergers, the relative merits of the
proposed Mergers as compared to any alternative business strategies that might have existed for the Company or the
effect of any other transaction in which the Company might have engaged or considered. Citi’s opinion is not intended
to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any
matters relating to the proposed Mergers or otherwise.

Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in
connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its

connection with evaluating a strategic transaction outside of the Company’s ordinary course of business,
including a possible sale of the Company, pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 24, 2022. On
March 1, 2023, Barclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the
Transaction Committee that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations
and assumptions stated in its opinion, from a financial point of view, the Merger Consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock (other than the executive officers of the
Company and other than TOMS Acquisition II LLC and Imperial Landscape Sponsor LLC (together, the
“Excluded Stockholders”)) in the Mergers is fair to such holders.
The full text of Barclays’ written opinion is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement. Barclays’

considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are

severance and other benefits payable in the case of certain qualifying terminations under the terms of
individual employment agreements;

“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Mergers”.
No Solicitation (page 112)
The Merger Agreement generally restricts the Company’s ability to directly or indirectly solicit Takeover
Proposals (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - No
Solicitation”) from third parties (including by furnishing non-public information), to participate in
discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding any Takeover Proposal, to enter into agreements
providing for or relating to any Takeover Proposal or to approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal.
Under certain circumstances, however, and in compliance with certain obligations under the Merger
Agreement, if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives a Takeover
Proposal that did not result from any breach of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the Company may
furnish information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with, a person in respect of a Takeover
Proposal if in each case, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - No Solicitation”) and not taking such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - No Solicitation”.
Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 124)
In addition to the circumstances described above, Parent and the Company have certain rights to
terminate the Merger Agreement under customary circumstances, including (a) by the mutual written consent
of Parent and the Company, (b) the imposition of a final and non-appealable Restraint, (c) certain uncured
breaches of the Merger Agreement by the other party, (d) if the Company Merger Effective Time

been obtained. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement”.

Agreement - Termination Fees”.
Effect on the Company If the Mergers Are Not Completed (page 36)

for any other reason:

receive, any payment for their respective shares of Company Capital Stock or OpCo Common Units,
as applicable, pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
(a) Radius will remain an independent public company; (b) Class A Common Stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (c) Radius will continue

Q: What will I receive if the Mergers are completed?
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Company Merger Effective Time:
each share of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time, except for the Appraisal Shares, Owned Company Common Stock and shares
of Company Restricted Stock, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest and subject to any required withholding of tax;

Company Merger Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest and subject to any required withholding of tax; and
each share of Series B Founder Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time will be canceled for no consideration.
In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, at the OpCo Merger Effective Time:
each OpCo Class A Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the OpCo Merger
Effective Time will be converted into one unit of limited liability company interests in the Surviving
LLC and thereafter represent ownership of limited liability company interests in the Surviving LLC;
each OpCo Class B Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the OpCo Merger
Effective Time, except for Owned OpCo Class B Common Units and any Rollover Equity, will be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any
required withholding of tax;
each Series A Rollover Profits Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the OpCo Merger Effective
Time will be canceled and cease to exist and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor;
each Series B Rollover Profits Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the OpCo Merger Effective
Time will be deemed fully vested (to the extent unvested) and be treated in the same manner as other
OpCo Class B Common Units; and
the Carry Unit will be canceled for no consideration.
If, between March 1, 2023 and the Closing, the number of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock
or equity interests of OpCo changes into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange

(other than pursuant to any Rollover Agreement) of shares or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and the cash amounts owed in respect of Company equity awards, as applicable, will be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange (other than pursuant to any Rollover Agreement) of shares or similar
transaction.
Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers?
The receipt of cash pursuant to the Company Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if you are a holder of Company
Common Stock who is a U.S. holder (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Mergers”), you will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of
cash you receive in the Company Merger and your adjusted tax basis in your shares of Company
Common Stock converted into cash in the Company Merger.
If you are a holder of Company Common Stock who is a non-U.S. holder (as defined below in the section
of this proxy statement titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers”), the Company Merger will generally not be taxable to you
under U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections to the United States or we are
or have been a United States real property holding corporation and certain other conditions are met.
You should read the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers” beginning on page 98 for
a more complete discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Company
Merger. You should consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of how the Mergers will affect
your U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes in light of your particular circumstances.
Q: What will happen to outstanding Radius equity compensation awards in the Mergers?
As of Company Merger Effective Time or OpCo Merger Effective Time, as applicable, except as
otherwise agreed by Parent and the applicable award holder, including pursuant to any Rollover
Agreement:
each Company Stock Option outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement, whether vested or
unvested, or outstanding as of the Company Merger Effective Time and vested, will vest (to the
extent unvested) and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment, without interest, equal
to the product of the Merger Consideration, less the applicable exercise price, and the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; provided that any such
Company Stock Option with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration will be canceled for no consideration;
each LTIP Unit outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement, except for Rollover Equity, will
vest with all applicable performance conditions deemed satisfied and be canceled in exchange for a
lump-sum cash payment, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which such LTIP Unit is convertible immediately
prior to the OpCo Merger Effective Time;
each share of Company Restricted Stock held by an employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time will be canceled and converted into an RS Payment Right; provided that, if the
employment of a holder of an RS Payment Right is terminated following the Company Merger
Effective Time but prior to the applicable vesting date by Parent without Cause (as defined in the
Company Stock Plan) or due to death or Disability (as defined in the Company Stock Plan), then the
vesting and payment of such RS Payment Right will be accelerated to the first payroll date after the
date of such termination; and
each share of Company Restricted Stock held by a non-employee director of the Company Board that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, whether vested or

unvested, will vest (to the extent unvested) and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash
payment, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration.
With respect to Company Stock Options and LTIP Units granted to employees of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries following the date of the Merger Agreement, such equity awards will generally be
canceled as of Company Merger Effective Time or OpCo Merger Effective Time, as applicable, and
converted into a Post-Signing Award Payment Right; provided that, if the employment of a holder of
such Post-Signing Award Payment Right is terminated following the Company Merger Effective Time or
OpCo Merger Effective Time, as applicable, but prior to the applicable vesting date by Parent without
Cause (as defined in the Company Stock Plan) or due to death or Disability (as defined in the Company
Stock Plan), then the vesting and payment of such Post-Signing Award Payment Right will be
accelerated to the first payroll date after the date of such termination. For more information, please see
the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Company Equity
Awards”.
Q: What will happen to the Company ESPP and Company Stock Plan?
Prior to the Closing, the Company will take such actions as are necessary to provide that no new
offering period or purchase period will commence under the Company ESPP on or after the date of the
Merger Agreement and both the Company ESPP and the Company Stock Plan will terminate as of the
Company Merger Effective Time.
Q: How do Radius’ directors and executive officers intend to vote?
On March 1, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement and as a condition to the
Parent Parties’ entry into the Merger Agreement, William H. Berkman, Imperial Landscape Sponsor LLC
(an affiliated entity of Michael D. Fascitelli, a director of the Company) and TOMS Acquisition II LLC
(an affiliated entity of Noam Gottesman, a director of the Company), directly or indirectly through their
respective affiliated persons or entities, as applicable, that, as of March 1, 2023, collectively held
approximately 11% voting power of the outstanding Company Capital Stock, entered into voting and
support agreements with the Parent Parties (collectively, the “Director Voting and Support
Agreements”). Pursuant to the Director Voting and Support Agreements, the aforementioned directors
of the Company (and their respective affiliated persons or entities, as applicable), solely in their
capacity as Company Stockholders, have agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of Company
Capital Stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated
thereby at the Special Meeting, with certain exceptions (as further described in the section titled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Voting and Support Agreements”). As of the Record
Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
[22,885,067] shares of Company Capital Stock, representing approximately [17.6]% voting power of the
outstanding Company Capital Stock as of such date. We currently expect that all directors and executive
officers of the Company, including those that are not party to the Director Voting and Support
Agreements, will vote all of their respective shares of Company Capital Stock: (1) “FOR” the Merger
Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal. For more information regarding the Director Voting and Support Agreements and security
ownership of directors and executive officers of the Company, see the sections of this proxy statement
titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Voting and Support Agreements” and “Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management”.
Q: Are there any other voting agreements in place with Company Stockholders?
Yes, in addition to the Director Voting and Support Agreements, on March 1, 2023, concurrently with the
execution of the Merger Agreement and as a condition to the Parent Parties’ entry into the Merger
Agreement, Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and its affiliates that, as of March 1, 2023, collectively held
approximately 10% voting power of the outstanding Company Capital Stock, entered into a voting and
support agreement with the Parent Parties (the “Centerbridge Voting and Support Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Centerbridge Voting and Support Agreement, Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and its
affiliates have agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of Company Capital Stock in favor of

the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transaction contemplated thereby at the Special
Meeting, with certain exceptions (as further described in the section titled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement - Voting and Support Agreements”).
Do any of the Company’s directors or executive officers have any interests in the Mergers that are different from,
or in addition to, my interests as a Company Stockholder?
In considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting, you should be aware that the
Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the Mergers that may be different
from, or in addition to, your interests as a Company Stockholder. The Company Board and the
Transaction Committee were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to
approve the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and
recommend that Company Stockholders approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. These interests may
include:
the treatment of Company equity awards provided for under the Merger Agreement;
severance and other benefits payable in the case of certain qualifying terminations under the terms of
individual employment agreements;
the potential to receive, with respect to annual bonuses for the year in which the Closing occurs, for
the portion of the performance period that elapses following the Closing, a bonus at no less than
target level;
the potential grant of cash-based retention and/or transaction awards under programs established for
the benefit of certain Company employees;
agreements to rollover a portion of existing equity interests in OpCo into equity interests in the
Surviving LLC;
the continued employment of certain executive officers after Closing pursuant to new employment
agreements entered into with Chord TopCo, LP;
eligibility for certain executive officers and employees to participate in a new management equity
program and/or cash-based long-term term incentive plan following the Closing;
the potential for Mr. Berkman and certain of his affiliated entities to be indemnified by the Surviving
LLC and/or the Surviving Corporation for certain tax liabilities under a tax protection agreement; and
continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the Merger Agreement, the Company’s
organizational documents and indemnification agreements the Company has entered into with each of
its directors and executive officers, including, with respect to the Company’s executive officers, under
individual employment agreements.
These interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section titled
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Mergers”.
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal and to approve the Advisory Compensation
Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?
The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock entitled to vote thereon at the Special Meeting, voting together as a single class, is required to
adopt the Merger Agreement. The approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of
Company Capital Stock or vote at the virtual special meeting, or the failure to instruct your broker on
how to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but,
assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same
20

Q:

Q: 
A: 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will
have no effect on the Advisory Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each “broker
non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares
should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1)
“FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR”
the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, the chairman of the Special Meeting or the
Company Board may adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Agreement
Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.
Q: What happens if the Mergers are not completed?
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Company Stockholders or if the Mergers are not completed
for any other reason, Company Stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Company
Capital Stock. Instead, Radius will remain an independent public company, Class A Common Stock will
continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and Radius will
continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under certain circumstances, Radius will be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee and,
under certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay Radius the Parent Termination Fee. For
more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - 
Termination Fees”.
Why are Company Stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Advisory
Compensation Proposal?
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Radius to seek an advisory (nonbinding)
vote with respect to certain payments that will or may be paid or become payable to its named executive
officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby.
What will happen if Company Stockholders do not approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal at the Special
Meeting?
The vote on executive compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to Radius’ named
executive officers that is based or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the Merger Agreement
Proposal. Accordingly, Company Stockholders may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal
and vote not to approve the Advisory Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the Advisory
Compensation Proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on the Company or the Board;
as the Company is contractually obligated to pay such compensation, such compensation will or may be
paid or become payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the Mergers are
consummated and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.
What do I need to do now?
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy
statement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Mergers and
how they affect you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in
accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Special
Meeting - Voting at the Special Meeting”), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If
you hold your shares in “street name”, please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.

Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
No. After the Mergers are completed, the Paying Agent will mail a check, or make a wire transfer, to each
holder of book-entry shares in an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any required withholding of tax, to which such holder is
entitled, as described in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Exchange
and Payment Procedures”.
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Company Capital Stock after the Record Date but
before the Special Meeting?
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the
Mergers are expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Company Capital Stock after
the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a
proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and
each of you notifies Radius in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any required withholding of tax, if the
Mergers are completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your
right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of
Company Capital Stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or
by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement titled

What is the difference between holding Company Capital Stock as a stockholder of record and holding shares in
“street name” as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., you are considered to be the “stockholder of record” with respect to those shares. In
this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Radius.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial
owner” of shares of Company Capital Stock held in “street name”. In that case, this proxy statement has
been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those
shares, to be the “stockholder of record”. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You
are also invited to attend the virtual Special Meeting.
How may I vote?
If you are a stockholder of record of a Company Capital Stock (that is, if your shares of Company
Capital Stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent),
there are four ways to vote:
Internet: Vote at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RADI2023SM in advance of the Special
Meeting. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June
[•], 2023. Once you enter the Internet voting system, you can record and confirm (or change) your
voting instructions.
Telephone: Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is
available 24 hours a day in the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June [•], 2023. Once you
enter the telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or
change) your voting instructions.
Mail: Mark your voting instructions on the card and sign, date and return it in the postage-paid
envelope provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before June [•], 2023
on June [•], 2023.

the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website by using the 16-digit control number included

in your proxy materials. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the
Special Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.
If your shares of Company Capital Stock are held in “street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee,
the holder of your shares will provide you with a copy of this proxy statement, a voting instruction form
and directions on how to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the
Internet or by telephone.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy
to ensure your vote is counted. We encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by
telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy
card by mail. You may still attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat if you have already voted by
proxy.
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over
the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on
your proxy card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for
which you will be responsible.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through
your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided
by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is a Company Stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such
Company Stockholder on his or her behalf. If you are a stockholder of record of Company Capital Stock,
you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided
in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares beneficially in “street name”, you should follow the
voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
If a Company Stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or
your proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or
telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or
against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before
the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be
voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the
Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
If my broker holds my shares in “street name”, will my broker vote my shares for me?
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently
scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals,
which will have the same effect as if you voted against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal.
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this
proxy statement. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy by
any of the following actions:

You may vote again over the Internet or by telephone as instructed on your proxy card before the

You may submit another properly signed proxy card with a later date; provided such proxy card is
received no later than the close of business on June [•], 2023.
You may send a signed written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Radius’ Secretary at 3 Bala
Plaza East, Suite 502, Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004; provided such written notice is received no later than

You may attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat. Simply attending the virtual Special Meeting
will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.
If you hold your shares of Company Capital Stock in “street name”, you should contact your bank,
broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the
Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website by using the 16-digit control number included in your

Banks and Brokers may call collect: +1 (212) 750-5833
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
This means you own shares of Company Capital Stock that are registered under different names or are in
more than one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a stockholder of record and
other shares through a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these
situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the
proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards
that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its
own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in
the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with
another Company Stockholder?
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery
requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more Company Stockholders sharing the same
address by delivering a single proxy statement to those Company Stockholders. This process, which is
commonly referred to as “householding”, potentially provides extra convenience for Company
Stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Radius and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy
materials to multiple Company Stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary
instructions have been received from the affected Company Stockholders. If at any time you no longer
wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your
household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future
deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage
account or Radius if you are a stockholder of record by making a request to our Secretary at 3 Bala Plaza
East, Suite 502, Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004 or by calling +1 (610) 660-4910. In addition, Radius will promptly
deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the
proxy statement.
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special

Meeting. In addition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, Radius
will file the final voting results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been
certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
Radius has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special
Meeting. Radius expects to pay Innisfree M&A Incorporated a fee of $30,000, plus certain costs
associated with additional services, as necessary, and Innisfree M&A Incorporated will be reimbursed
for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. Radius has agreed to indemnify Innisfree M&A
Incorporated against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of
proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
Radius also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their
respective agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Company
Capital Stock. Radius directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by
electronic means or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
When do you expect the Mergers to be completed?
We currently expect to complete the Mergers in the third quarter of 2023. However, the exact timing of
completion of the Mergers cannot be predicted because the Mergers are subject to the closing
conditions specified in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which
are outside of our control. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Closing of the Mergers”.
How can I obtain additional information about Radius?
Radius will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2022
Annual Report to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022, without charge to any Company Stockholder who makes a request in writing or by
telephone to Radius’ Investor Relations Department at 3 Bala Plaza East, Suite 502, Bala Cynwyd, PA

"Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc._20230505_DEFM14A_20858042_4661091.Pdf",CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The information contained in this proxy statement, together with other statements and information
publicly disseminated by Radius, contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. For these statements, we claim the protections of the safe harbor for forward-looking
statements contained in such Sections. These forward-looking statements include information about
possible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans
and objectives. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-
looking terminology, including the terms “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “continue,”
“intend,” “should,” “may,” “will,” or similar expressions, their negative or other variations or comparable
terminology.
Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations based upon our
historical performance and on our current plans, estimates and expectations in light of information available
to us. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by
law, we are not obligated to, and do not intend to, publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
made herein after the date of this proxy statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and assumptions
relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business, prospects, growth strategy and
liquidity and the Mergers. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements as a prediction of actual results.
Certain important factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected
results are summarized below. Other factors besides those listed could also adversely affect us. We operate
in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to
time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks and uncertainties or how they may affect
us. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor,
or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-
looking statements.
Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these
statements include, but are not limited to:
the Mergers may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that any required
antitrust and foreign investment approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to
unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect us or the expected benefits of the Mergers or
that the approval of the Company Stockholders is not obtained;
the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the Mergers may not
be satisfied or waived, including the failure (a) to receive any required antitrust and foreign
investment approvals from any applicable governmental entities (or any conditions, limitations or
restrictions placed on such approvals) and (b) to satisfy conditions related to (i) there being no event
of default under certain of the Company’s existing debt facilities, (ii) certain waivers of change of
control provisions under certain of the debt agreements of the Company and its subsidiaries being in
full force and effect at the Closing, including the possibility that such waivers fail to be in full force
and effect at the Closing because any two of Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce and Mr. Goldstein have ceased
to continue in their current capacities as Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating
Officer of the Company, respectively, at the Closing, and (iii) the Company having a specified
minimum cash balance and the Company or any of its subsidiaries having an additional specified
amount of additional cash, in each case at the Closing;
the possibility that compliance with the minimum cash condition to the consummation of the Mergers
described above may limit the growth of the Company’s business, depending on the availability to
the Company of other sources of capital that are permitted under the terms of the Merger Agreement;
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of
the Mergers, including in circumstances that would require us to pay a termination fee or other
expenses;

The Company Board has set May 9, 2023 as the Record Date for the Special Meeting. If you were the
owner of Company Capital Stock at the close of business on the Record Date, you are entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Stockholders of record of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are
entitled to one vote for each share of common stock they held on the Record Date. Holders of shares of our
Founder Preferred Stock are entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock or Class B Common Stock, as applicable, into which each share of Founder Preferred Stock held of
record by such holder could then be converted. As described more fully in the Company Charter, our
Founder Preferred Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as applicable,
on a one-for-one basis. Holders of any LTIP Units held in tandem with their related Class B Common Stock
and/or Series B Founder Preferred Stock, as applicable, whether vested or unvested, are entitled to a number
of votes equal to the number of votes that the shares of Class B Common Stock and/or Series B Founder
Preferred Stock, as applicable, that are held in tandem with such LTIP Units are entitled.
At the close of business on the Record Date, there were (1) [99,664,040] shares of Class A Common
Stock (which includes [•] restricted shares of Class A Common Stock that are subject to vesting conditions)
issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, (2) [10,255,811] shares of Class B Common Stock issued,
outstanding and entitled to vote and (3) 2,986,033 shares of Founder Preferred Stock (which includes
1,600,000 Series A Founder Preferred Stock and 1,386,033 Series B Founder Preferred Stock) issued,
outstanding and entitled to vote.
A list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be open to examination by
any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the Special Meeting, during normal business hours for a period
of ten days before and during the Special Meeting at our corporate offices at 3 Bala Plaza East, Suite 502,
Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004. Stockholders may also contact Investor Relations at +1 (610) 660-4910 and
arrangements will be made to review the records in person. The list of the Company Stockholders will also be
available on the bottom of your screen during the Special Meeting after entering your control number
included on your notice of internet availability or the voting instructions you received to enter the meeting.
The holders of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding Company Capital Stock entitled to
vote thereat must be present at the Special Meeting, either present in person or represented by proxy, for the
Company to hold the Special Meeting and conduct business. This is called a “quorum”. Your shares will be
counted as present at the Special Meeting for quorum purposes if you either attend our Special Meeting or
properly submit your proxy prior to the Special Meeting. Shares subject to a broker non-vote (as defined
below) will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for
the transaction of business at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special
Meeting, it is expected that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.
To vote your shares before the Special Meeting, please follow the instructions for Internet or telephone
voting in the notice of internet availability, your other proxy materials or in your voting instructions. You

may also vote by signing and submitting your proxy card and returning it by mail, if you are the stockholder

if you are the beneficial owner. We encourage you to vote before the Special Meeting even if you plan to

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock entitled to vote thereon at the Special Meeting, voting together as a single class, is required to adopt
the Merger Agreement. As of the Record Date, [56,452,943] votes constitute a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Company Stockholders is a
condition to the consummation of the Mergers. The approval of the Advisory Compensation Proposal and
the Adjournment Proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the applicable
proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of
Company Capital Stock or vote at the virtual special meeting, or the failure to instruct your broker on how to
vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Advisory
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Advisory Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when
banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the
applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not
have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from
the beneficial owner of such shares. Radius does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting
because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary
authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine”, whereas each of the proposals to be presented
at the Special Meeting is considered “non-routine”. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your
shares of Company Capital Stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. If you properly sign
your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2)
“FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not
present, the chairman of the Special Meeting or the Company Board may adjourn or postpone the Special
Meeting.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Agreement
Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.",40,40

You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by

that the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-
effective and reliable alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares

To vote your shares before the Special Meeting, please follow the instructions for Internet or telephone
voting in the notice of internet availability, your other proxy materials or in your voting instructions. You
may also vote by signing and submitting your proxy card and returning it by mail, if you are the stockholder
of record, or by signing the voter instruction form provided by your bank or broker and returning it by mail,

you will need your control number. We encourage you to vote before the Special Meeting even if you plan to

All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received by the deadline will be voted at
the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the Company Stockholder. Properly signed and
dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. If you
indicate on your proxy card that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal but do not
indicate a choice on the Adjournment Proposal or the Advisory Compensation Proposal on a nonbinding
advisory basis, your shares of Company Capital Stock will be voted “FOR” each such proposal. Proxy cards
that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the Special Meeting and cannot be
voted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through
your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee or attending the Special Meeting and voting using your control number, or, if you
did not obtain a control number, contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number
so that you may vote. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through

If the Mergers are consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Capital Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL and, if all
procedures described in Section 262 of the DGCL are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for
the fair value of their shares of Company Capital Stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Mergers, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together
with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your
shares of Company Capital Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less
than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the
32 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Merger Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of
such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL will not receive the Merger
Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an
amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company Capital Stock following petition to, and an
appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair
value of their shares of Company Capital Stock determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the
same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to comply
strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of
appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, persons
wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to
exercise such rights.
A holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Company Capital Stock who (a) continuously holds
such shares through the Company Merger Effective Time, (b) has not consented to or otherwise voted in
favor of the Mergers or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (c) strictly complies with the
procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL, (d) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for
appraisal of such shares and (e) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (i) reasonably identifies in
his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (ii) provides
documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such
documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (iii) provides an address at
which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the
Chancery List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Appraisal
Rights”), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company Capital Stock exclusive
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Mergers, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the
fair value.

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the
Merger Agreement. This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among
members of the Company Board, members of the Transaction Committee, Company management, the
Company’s and the Transaction Committee’s respective financial and legal advisors, Company
management’s respective legal advisors, EQT, PSP and their respective financial and legal advisors or any
other person.
The Company Board has, from time to time and in consultation with the Company’s management and
financial and legal advisors, evaluated a range of financial and strategic opportunities, including potential
acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, business combinations and other similar transactions, as well as
the possibility of obtaining capital investments from third parties in the public and private markets to fund
the Company’s consistent need for capital to support its acquisition growth strategy. These evaluations
have focused on, among other things, the business and macroeconomic environment facing digital
infrastructure operators, as well as conditions and trends in the industry, and included Company Board
discussions as to the advantages and risks of different strategies for short- and long-term value creation.
Such discussions included whether the Company should continue to execute on its strategy as a stand-alone
public company, pursue various joint ventures to fund its acquisition growth strategy, including a possible
minority equity investment in the subsidiaries of the Company that own the Company’s multinational,
diversified, cash-yielding portfolio of real property digital infrastructure assets (such subsidiaries,
collectively, “YieldCo” and such potential investment, a “YieldCo transaction”), seek to make larger scale
acquisitions or pursue a sale of the entire Company to a third party (a “WholeCo transaction”). As a result,
members of the Company’s management and representatives of the Company’s financial and legal advisors
have from time to time engaged in discussions with representatives of other companies, and their financial
and legal advisors, that operate in, or are interested in, the digital infrastructure industry, as well as financial
sponsors, including EQT and PSP, regarding such opportunities.
38 TABLE OF CONTENTS
In March 2021, the Company entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement with a publicly listed
company focused on digital infrastructure that we refer to as “Party A” to engage in preliminary discussions
regarding a potential strategic relationship. Following execution of this mutual non-disclosure agreement,
representatives of the Company and representatives of Party A from time to time discussed potential
business relationships and strategic opportunities, including potential joint ventures, business combinations
and other similar transactions.
In December 2021, the Company entered into non-disclosure agreements with each of EQT, a financial
sponsor that we refer to as “Party B” and a financial sponsor that we refer to as “Party C”, to engage in
preliminary discussions regarding potential capital investments in the Company and its subsidiaries.
Following execution of these non-disclosure agreements, representatives of the Company, on the one hand,
and representatives of each of EQT and Party C, on the other hand, had preliminary discussions regarding
various capital investment opportunities, including a potential YieldCo transaction.
On February 9, 2022, William C. Berkman, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
Scott G. Bruce, President of the Company, and Benjamin Judson, Vice President of the Company, met with
representatives of Party C in New York City for introductory purposes.
On February 11, 2022, Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Judson and Richard I. Goldstein, Chief Operating
Officer of the Company, met with representatives of Party A in New York City (with Mr. Goldstein
participating remotely) to have preliminary discussions regarding various capital investment opportunities,
including a potential YieldCo transaction.
On February 25, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company in attendance, at which meeting, among other things, the Company Board
discussed the strategic rationale of a potential YieldCo transaction to further fund the Company’s acquisition
growth strategy and determined to undertake a process to pursue a YieldCo transaction. As part of this
discussion, Company management discussed with the Company Board features of a potential YieldCo
transaction that it would seek in any such process, including: seeking an initial contribution by a minority
investor into YieldCo in the range $300 to $500 million, the proceeds of which would be used to acquire
additional cash yielding digital infrastructure assets; subsequent contributions of cash on a pro-rata basis
between the Company and any such minority investor to acquire additional digital infrastructure assets post-
closing; and the periodic post-closing receipt by the Company of management and incentive fees and
reimbursement of certain expenses for the ongoing management of YieldCo’s business and services provided
to YieldCo by the subsidiaries of the Company that own and operate the Company’s business of developing
and acquiring digital infrastructure assets (such subsidiaries, collectively, “DevCo”). Based on their
expertise and experience in transactions in the digital infrastructure industry, the Company Board determined
to engage Citi (in a lead role) and Goldman Sachs to act as financial advisors to the Company Board in
connection with its exploration of strategic alternatives, including with a respect to a YieldCo transaction.
Following the February 25, 2022 meeting of the Company Board, at the direction of the Company Board,
members of the Company’s management and representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs initiated a process to
solicit interest from potential investors in a YieldCo transaction. During the course of the process, 14
potential investors (including EQT, Party B, Party C and PSP) were contacted and 11 parties executed non-
disclosure agreements (or, in the case of EQT, Party B and Party C, amendments to existing non-disclosure
agreements). As part of the YieldCo transaction process, Company management and representatives of the
Company Board’s financial and legal advisors held a number of meetings with parties evaluating a YieldCo
transaction to discuss certain due diligence matters. Among these non-disclosure agreements executed in
connection with the YieldCo transaction process, three contained standstill agreements, all of which expired
upon the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement.
On March 18, 2022, at the direction of the Company Board, Citi and Goldman Sachs sent a process letter
to each of the potential counterparties that had expressed interest in a YieldCo transaction, along with a draft
term sheet for a YieldCo transaction, requesting the submission of written proposals and markups to a draft
term sheet for a YieldCo transaction that had been prepared by the Company by April 12, 2022.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
During the weeks of March 21, 2022 and March 28, 2022, Company management and representatives of
the Company Board’s financial and legal advisors held management presentations with potential
counterparties in a YieldCo transaction (including EQT, PSP, Party B, Party C, a financial sponsor that we
refer to as “Party D” and a financial sponsor that we refer to as “Party E”).
On March 28, 2022, the Company received from Party A an indication of interest to acquire the Company
in a WholeCo transaction for $17.50 per share of Company Class A Stock in cash. Party A’s indication of
interest in a WholeCo transaction was unsolicited. The Company Board was notified of Party A’s indication
of interest in a WholeCo transaction after receipt thereof.
On April 6, 2022, Mr. Berkman and a representative of Citi met with representatives of Party E to discuss
Party E’s interest in pursuing a YieldCo transaction.
On April 11, 2022, Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Judson, Thomas C. King, a member of the Company
Board, and a representative of Citi, on the one hand, and representatives of Party C, on the other hand, met
for dinner in New York City to continue their preliminary discussions, including with respect to a YieldCo
transaction.
On April 12, 2022, a representative of Party A contacted a representative of Citi on an unsolicited basis
to indicate that Party A remained interested in pursuing a WholeCo transaction.
On April 12, 2022 and April 13, 2022, the Company received two proposals for a YieldCo transaction, one
proposal for a minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo and one proposal for a majority investment
in YieldCo. While these proposals are difficult to compare due to different characteristics and terms, the
proposals received consisted of the following headline terms:
a written proposal from Party B to invest $500 million to acquire a 24.3% stake in YieldCo, which
proposal included a list of issues in the draft term sheet for a YieldCo transaction;
a written proposal from Party D to invest $300 million to acquire a 22.1% stake in YieldCo, which
proposal included a markup of the draft term sheet for a YieldCo transaction; a written proposal from
PSP to invest $595 million to acquire a 25% stake in YieldCo and an amount to be determined to
acquire a 25% stake in DevCo, which proposal included a list of issues for certain terms of its
proposed minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo; and
a written proposal from EQT to acquire a majority stake in YieldCo in the range of 75% to 80%
structured as a $1,050 million purchase of equity from YieldCo and a $200 million cash contribution to
YieldCo (such proposals, collectively, the “April 2022 YieldCo Proposals”).
In addition to proposing structures and investment amounts that differed from the YieldCo approach set out
in the YieldCo process letter, the April 2022 YieldCo Proposals varied with respect to, among other things, the
terms of the management and incentive fees for the Company and certain other terms relating to governance,
transfer restrictions and post-closing acquisition of digital infrastructure assets.
In mid-April 2022, representatives of Citi, on the one hand, and representatives of EQT, on the other
hand, held telephone calls to discuss a YieldCo transaction. During such calls, EQT indicated to Citi that it
would be interested in pursuing a WholeCo transaction. EQT’s indication of interest in a WholeCo
transaction was unsolicited.
On April 14, 2022, Party E, which had entered into a non-disclosure agreement with the Company on
March 14, 2022 in connection with the YieldCo transaction process, submitted a proposal letter that indicated
Party E had evaluated a YieldCo transaction, but believed it would be able to provide a significantly more
compelling proposal through a WholeCo transaction. Party E did not provide a valuation at which it was
proposing to engage in a WholeCo transaction, but identified key due diligence information that it would
need to finalize a more concrete proposal. The Company Board was notified of Party E’s indication of interest
in a WholeCo transaction after receipt thereof. Party E’s indication of interest in a WholeCo transaction was
unsolicited.
On April 19, 2022, Party C submitted a written indication of interest to acquire the Company in a
WholeCo transaction for $20.25 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash. Party C’s indication of
40 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
interest in a WholeCo transaction was unsolicited. The Company Board was notified of Party C’s indication
of interest in a WholeCo transaction after receipt thereof.
On April 19, 2022, members of Company management and representatives of Citi, on the one hand, and
representatives of Party E, on the other hand, held a telephone call to discuss certain of the due diligence
matters identified in the proposal letter received from Party E.
On April 22, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel to the Company
Board (“Cravath”), and Citi in attendance, at which meeting the Company Board discussed the April 2022
YieldCo Proposals, as well as the unsolicited indications of interest in a WholeCo transaction received from
Party A, Party C and Party E. Representatives of Citi reviewed with the Company Board its preliminary
financial analyses relating to YieldCo as part of the YieldCo transaction process.
On April 24, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath in attendance, at which meeting the Company
Board continued its discussion of the April 2022 YieldCo Proposals and the unsolicited indications of
interest in a WholeCo transaction received from Party A, Party C and Party E and the advantages and risks of
exploring a potential YieldCo transaction only, potential WholeCo transaction only or a dual-track process.
Additionally, the Company Board discussed, among other things, then current macroeconomic conditions,
including various future economic scenarios, and the potential impact on the Company’s incremental cost of
capital required to support its acquisition growth strategy, the potential impact on the short- and long-term
trading price of shares of Class A Common Stock and the potential impact on the Company achieving the
benefits of greater scale over the short- and long-term (each of which could negatively affect the Company’s
financial performance).
Following that discussion, the Company Board determined that it would direct its financial advisors to
(a) continue discussions with Party B regarding its proposed minority investment in YieldCo and PSP
regarding its proposed minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo and (b) solicit interest from
potential counterparties in a WholeCo transaction (including EQT, in light of its proposal to acquire a
majority stake in YieldCo). The Company Board declined to move forward with Party D based on a holistic
review of the investment, structuring and other terms on which Party D had proposed to engage in a YieldCo
transaction.
Following the April 24, 2022 meeting of the Company Board, at the direction of the Company Board, the
Company and its financial advisors undertook a dual-track process to continue discussions with Party B
regarding a YieldCo transaction and with PSP regarding a minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo
and to solicit interest from potential counterparties in a WholeCo transaction. During the course of this
process, 20 potential buyers were contacted (including EQT, PSP, other participants from the YieldCo
transaction process and Party A, a potential strategic buyer that we refer to as “Party F” and a potential
strategic buyer that we refer to as “Party G”) and ten parties either executed non-disclosure agreements or, in
the case of parties that were participants in the YieldCo transaction process, had existing non-disclosure
agreements with the Company (which existing agreements, in certain cases, were amended in connection with
the WholeCo transaction process). Among such non-disclosure agreements, eight contained standstill
agreements, all of which expired upon the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement. Based on
discussions with representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs, and in light of what had then become a volatile
macroeconomic environment with rising inflation and rising interest rates, Company management were aware
that potential counterparties in a WholeCo transaction process may have difficulty obtaining acquisition
financing or be unable to obtain acquisition financing on terms that would support a purchase price that
would be attractive to Company Stockholders. The Company directed representatives of Citi and Goldman
Sachs to advise participants in the WholeCo transaction process that the Company expected its existing
indebtedness (other than the Convertible Notes) to be portable in connection with any WholeCo transaction.
Additionally, as part of the WholeCo transaction process, Company management and the Company Board’s
financial and legal advisors held a number of meetings with parties evaluating a WholeCo transaction to
discuss certain due diligence matters.
On May 4, 2022, at PSP’s request, Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Judson and representatives of Citi and
Goldman Sachs, on the one hand, met with representatives of PSP, on the other hand, in New York City to
further discuss PSP’s proposed minority investment in each of YieldCo and DevCo.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On May 6, 2022, Bloomberg reported that the Company was exploring strategic options, including a
potential WholeCo transaction. Following the Bloomberg report, PSP informed the Company that it wished to
pursue a WholeCo transaction and that if the Company Board determined it would not pursue a WholeCo
transaction that PSP would continue to be interested in pursuing a minority investment in each of YieldCo
and DevCo.
On May 9, 2022, the Company received from Party B a markup of the draft term sheet for a YieldCo
transaction, which continued to propose an investment of $500 million for a 24.3% stake in YieldCo.
Beginning in mid-May 2022, in connection with the WholeCo transaction process, eight potential
counterparties (including EQT, PSP, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party E, a financial sponsor that we refer to as
“Party H” and a financial sponsor that we refer to as “Party I”) were provided access to a virtual data room
that contained more information on the Company. Party G did not execute a non-disclosure agreement and
was not granted access to such virtual data room.
On May 16, 2022, at the direction of the Company Board, Citi and Goldman Sachs sent a process letter
to each of the potential counterparties that had expressed interest in a WholeCo transaction, requesting the
submission of written proposals for a WholeCo transaction by June 1, 2022.
On May 20, 2022, Mr. Berkman met with representatives of Party H to discuss their interest in pursuing a
WholeCo transaction.
On May 24, 2022, the Company Board, acting by unanimous written consent, authorized and created the
Transaction Committee and empowered the Transaction Committee with full authority to review, consider,
evaluate, negotiate, accept, reject and recommend any potential WholeCo transaction in which one or more
officers, directors, stockholders or affiliates of the Company may have material interests that would be
additional to and/or materially different from the interests of disinterested Company Stockholders. The
Company Board determined to create the Transaction Committee at this point in recognition of the fact that,
unlike a YieldCo transaction, a WholeCo transaction could involve such matters. The Company Board
appointed Mr. King as chair of the Transaction Committee. The Transaction Committee retained Morris,
Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP (“Morris Nichols”) as its independent counsel and engaged Barclays, based
on its expertise and experience in transactions in the digital infrastructure industry, to act as its financial
advisor. The Transaction Committee met 19 times throughout the WholeCo transaction process.
On May 25, 2022, Party B contacted representatives of Citi to indicate that, although a YieldCo
transaction was its preferred transaction structure, Party B could pursue a potential WholeCo transaction if
the Company Board determined to move forward with a WholeCo transaction in lieu of a YieldCo transaction.
On June 1, 2022, the Company received three written proposals for a WholeCo transaction, one verbal
proposal for a WholeCo transaction and one written proposal for a YieldCo transaction. The proposals were
as follows: a written proposal for a WholeCo transaction from PSP to acquire the Company with an additional
minority investor or co-control partner (if any such co-investor could be identified) for $18.12 per share of
Class A Common Stock in cash; a written proposal for a WholeCo transaction from Party C to acquire the
Company for $18.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash; a written proposal for a WholeCo
transaction from EQT to acquire the Company for $15.50 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash; a
verbal indication from Party F that it was interested in acquiring the Company at a valuation in the range of
$18.00 to $19.50 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash; and a written proposal for a YieldCo transaction
from Party A to invest $306 million to acquire a 50% stake in YieldCo. Party A did not reengage on its prior
unsolicited proposal for a WholeCo transaction. Neither Party E nor Party I submitted a proposal for a
WholeCo transaction.

shared with the Company Board and Company management.
On June 7, 2022, following a request from the Company to provide its proposal for a WholeCo
transaction in writing, Party F informed representatives of Citi that it was no longer prepared to pursue a
WholeCo transaction at a valuation in the range of $18.00 to $19.50 per share of Class A Common Stock in
cash and that at that time Party F viewed the value of the Company as closer to its then current market price.
The shares of Class A Common Stock closed at $15.57 per share that day.
On June 7, 2022, Party H indicated to representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs that they intended to

proposal for a WholeCo transaction from Party H.
On June 9, 2022, at the direction of Company management, representatives of Citi and Goldman
contacted a financial sponsor that we refer to as “Party J” and a financial sponsor that we refer to as “Party
K” to assess their interest in a WholeCo transaction. Party J subsequently informed representatives of Citi
and Goldman Sachs that it was not interested in pursuing a WholeCo transaction. Following two preliminary
telephone calls with representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs regarding a WholeCo transaction, Party K
ceased engaging in the WholeCo transaction process.
On June 10, 2022, Party A informed representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs that it was planning to
submit a written proposal for a WholeCo transaction but ultimately Party A did not submit such a proposal.
On June 13, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Citi and Goldman Sachs in attendance, at which
meeting the Company Board directed Citi and Goldman to continue discussions with the parties interested in
a YieldCo transaction; invite EQT, PSP and Party C into the next phase of the WholeCo transaction process;
and engage with PSP on potential co-bidders.
On June 14, 2022, representatives of Citi held separate telephone calls with representatives of each of
EQT, PSP and Party C to discuss their respective written proposals for a WholeCo transaction and to invite
each of EQT, PSP and Party C into the next phase of the WholeCo transaction process. Also on this date,
representatives of Citi held a telephone call with representatives of Party B to discuss Party B’s potential
interest in pursuing a WholeCo transaction.
Beginning on June 14, 2022 and until mid-July 2022, following indications from PSP that it would not be
able to submit a proposal for a WholeCo transaction on its own, representatives of Citi, on the one hand, and
representatives of PSP, on the other hand, discussed potential co-bidders and the Company ultimately
consented to PSP’s request to discuss its proposed WholeCo transaction with three potential co-bidders
(one of which was EQT).
Beginning in June 2022 and until October 2022, the Transaction Committee had several discussions with
the holders of Series A Founder Preferred Stock and their counsel concerning the rights of such holders to
an annual dividend under the terms of the Company Charter and the treatment of such Series A Founder
Preferred Stock in a potential WholeCo transaction in the valuation ranges under consideration by the
Transaction Committee and the Company Board during that period. The Merger Agreement provides that
such holders of Series A Founder Preferred Stock are entitled to receive the same Merger Consideration upon
completion of the Company Merger as holders of Class A Common Stock.
On June 29, 2022, a representative of Party E contacted representatives of Citi and Goldman to inform
them that Party E would not be continuing to engage in discussions regarding a WholeCo transaction.

management, Citi and Goldman Sachs sent to EQT, PSP and Party C a process letter and provided such
parties by email an auction draft of the merger agreement that had been prepared by Cravath.
During July, August and September 2022, to facilitate the potential portability of the Company’s existing
indebtedness (other than the Convertible Notes), Company management’s representatives began
discussions with certain of the Company’s lenders to obtain waivers of, or amendments to, certain change of
control provisions in the Company’s existing debt agreements that would potentially be implicated by a
43 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
WholeCo transaction (which waivers and amendments we refer to in this section of the proxy statement titled
“- Background of the Mergers” as the “debt waivers and consents”). As a condition to providing debt
waivers and consents, certain of the Company’s lenders insisted on retaining an ability to call an event of
default under the applicable existing debt agreements if there was not continuity of Company management
after the closing of any WholeCo transaction, ultimately, making it clear that such lenders would not consent
to a WholeCo transaction without certain members of Company management being retained in connection
with a WholeCo transaction. As a result, such lenders required the inclusion of a condition that any two of
Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce and Mr. Goldstein must continue in their current capacities as Chief Executive
Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, respectively, at the closing of any WholeCo
transaction in order for such lenders’ waivers and consents to be effective.
On July 15, 2022, representatives of Cravath and representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP,

agreement. Also on July 15, 2022, Company management, representatives of Cravath and representatives of
Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP, the Company’s debt financing counsel (“Schulte”), on the one hand, and

WholeCo transaction with two potential co-bidders.
On July 21, 2022, representatives of EQT and Party B expressed to representatives of Citi in separate
discussions that that they were interested in being introduced to one another to have preliminary
discussions regarding a potential partnership in connection with a WholeCo transaction. The Company
subsequently permitted these discussions.
Also on July 21, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs delivered a relationship disclosure letter to the
Company Board providing information regarding certain of Goldman Sachs’ relationships with the Company,
Centerbridge Partners L.P., EQT and PSP and certain of their affiliates and portfolio companies (the “Goldman
Sachs Disclosure Letter”).
On July 22, 2022, Company management and representatives of Cravath and Schulte, on the one hand,
and representatives of EQT and Simpson, on the other hand, held a telephone call to discuss certain matters
relating to the potential portability of the Company’s existing indebtedness (other than the Convertible
Notes) and the Company’s existing capital structure.
Also on July 22, 2022, Company management and representatives of Cravath and Schulte, on the one
hand, and representatives of Party C and Party C’s outside counsel, on the other hand, held a telephone call
to discuss certain matters relating to the potential portability of the Company’s existing indebtedness (other
than the Convertible Notes) and the Company’s existing capital structure.
On July 25, 2022, at Party C’s request, the Company consented to Party C discussing its proposal for a
WholeCo transaction with a potential co-bidder.

partnership with EQT in connection with a WholeCo transaction and, ultimately, no proposal for a WholeCo
transaction was received from Party B.
On August 3, 2022, representatives of Citi provided Citi’s relationship disclosure letter to the Company
Board providing information regarding certain of Citi’s relationships with the Company, EQT and PSP and
certain of their affiliates and their portfolio companies (the “Citi Disclosure Letter”).
On August 4, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi, Goldman Sachs and
Barclays in attendance, at which meeting Company management reviewed the June 30, 2022 - 2032
Management Forecasts with the Company Board and representatives of Citi and Goldman reviewed with the
Company Board their respective preliminary financial analyses relating to the Company based on the June
30, 2022 - 2032 Management Forecasts. For more information about the June 30, 2022 - 2032 Management
Forecasts, see the section of this proxy statement titled “- Certain Financial Forecasts”.

and indicated that Party A remained interested in pursuing a WholeCo transaction.
On August 6, 2022, Party C’s outside counsel sent to Cravath a markup of the auction draft of the
merger agreement (which markup and subsequent revised drafts thereto are referred to in this section of the
proxy statement titled “- Background of the Mergers” as the “Party C Merger Agreement”), which Cravath
shared with Morris Nichols. Open points in the Party C Merger Agreement at this time included, among other
things: the purchase price; the specific amounts of termination fees to be payable by the parties to each
other and the triggers thereof and certain other deal protection issues; certain provisions regarding
conditions with respect to events of default that could arise under certain of the Company’s debt agreements
as result of actions taken or not taken by the Company during the period between signing and closing and
restrictions with respect to the remedies the Company could take or cause to be taken to cure such defaults
(which provisions we refer to in this section of the proxy statement titled “- Background of the Mergers” as
the “debt default” and “restricted remedies” provisions, respectively); and certain provisions regarding the
debt waivers and consents.
On August 8, 2022, Simpson sent to Cravath a markup of the auction draft of the merger agreement
(which markup and subsequent revised drafts thereto and final, executed version thereof, are referred to in
this section of the proxy statement titled “- Background of the Mergers” as the “Merger Agreement”), which
Cravath shared with Morris Nichols. Open points in the Merger Agreement at this time included, among
other things: the purchase price; the minimum cash and regulatory conditions; the specific amounts of
termination fees to be payable by the parties to each other and the triggers thereof and certain other deal
protection issues; and certain provisions regarding debt defaults, restricted remedies and the debt waivers
and consents.
On August 9, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman provided to Party A by email the auction draft
of the merger agreement that had been prepared by Cravath. Thereafter, representatives of Citi encouraged
Party A to submit a written proposal for a WholeCo transaction, but Party A ultimately did not submit such a
proposal.
On August 11, 2022, Company management was informed that the Transaction Committee had
authorized initial contact between Company management, on the one hand, and representatives of each of
EQT (in respect of its proposed WholeCo transaction) and Party C (in respect of its proposed WholeCo
transaction), on the other hand, subject to compliance with the June 2022 Guidelines, for purposes of limited
discussions regarding certain members of Company management’s interest in remaining with the Company
after the closing of a WholeCo transaction and willingness to rollover any portion of equity that such
individuals held in the Company and/or OpCo in a WholeCo transaction.
On August 11, 2022, the Company provided to EQT, PSP and Party C in the virtual data room a revised
draft of the confidential disclosure schedules to the auction draft of the merger agreement.
On August 16, 2022, Company management and representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols, on the
one hand, and representatives of Party C, on the other hand, held a telephone call to discuss the June 2022
Guidelines as they would relate to preliminary discussions between representatives of Party C, on the one
hand, and certain members of Company management, on the other hand.
On August 17, 2022, a representative of EQT informed Citi that EQT was no longer pursuing a WholeCo
transaction. EQT’s access to the virtual data room containing information about the Company that had been
established in connection with the WholeCo transaction was subsequently suspended.
On August 18, 2022, Party C submitted a revised written proposal to acquire the Company for $17.00 per
share of Class A Common Stock in cash, with a purchase price reduction for any amounts required to be paid
to obtain the debt waivers and consents. At this time, Party C also indicated that it wished to enter into
exclusivity with the Company. Also on this date, PSP submitted a letter reiterating its desire to partner with
the winning bidder as a co-investor for at least 25% of the equity but did not otherwise submit a revised
written proposal.
45 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 19, 2022, Party C’s outside counsel sent to Cravath a revised draft of the Party C Merger
Agreement, which Cravath shared with Morris Nichols.
On August 21, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi, Goldman Sachs and
Barclays in attendance. Mr. Berkman provided an update with respect to the WholeCo transaction process,
highlighting developments with respect to EQT, PSP, Party C and Party A since the prior Company Board
meeting. Representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs provided a summary of Party C’s revised written
proposal and the evolution thereof, noted to the Company Board that Party C had requested to proceed on
an exclusive basis, and reviewed with the Company Board their respective preliminary financial analyses
relating to the Company. The Company Board discussed potential next steps to take with Party C, including
whether to grant exclusivity, and reexamined the relative merits and considerations of strategic alternatives
other than a WholeCo transaction that the Company could pursue, including continuing as a stand-alone
company and potentially pursuing a YieldCo transaction. As part of that discussion, the Company Board
discussed with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols the Company Board’s obligations as they
relate to a WholeCo transaction to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable, including, if necessary, by
granting exclusivity to Party C if the Company Board believed that it would facilitate obtaining the best price.
A representative of Cravath then reviewed with the Company Board key points that were open in the Party C
Merger Agreement. After considering the advantages and risks of proceeding with Party C on an exclusive
basis in light of the open points, the Company Board directed Citi and Goldman to engage in further price
discovery with Party C. The Company Board determined that it would not grant exclusivity to Party C until
Party C had increased its proposed purchase price and shown further movement on key contractual terms
that were open.
On August 21, 2022, representatives of Citi contacted representatives of Party C to indicate that the
Company would not grant exclusivity unless Party C increased its proposed purchase price and showed
further movement on key contractual terms that were open.
On August 22, 2022, representatives of Party C contacted representatives of Citi to indicate that Party C
was willing to increase its proposed purchase price to $17.75 per share of Class Common Stock in cash, with
a purchase price reduction for any amounts required to be paid to obtain the debt waivers and consents, in
exchange for a two-week exclusivity period.
On August 22, 2022, Cravath sent to Party C’s outside counsel comments to certain provisions of Party
C’s draft of the Party C Merger Agreement that would need to be accepted for the Company Board to
consider granting exclusivity to Party C, including with respect to the specific amounts of termination fees to
be payable by the parties to each other under certain circumstances contemplated by the Party C Merger
Agreement and certain provisions regarding debt defaults, restricted remedies and the debt waivers and
consents.
On August 23, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi, Goldman Sachs and
Barclays in attendance. Company management provided an update with respect to the WholeCo transaction
process and the negotiations with Party C. Representatives of Citi and Goldman noted that following receipt
of Party C’s revised bid of $17.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash, Citi had engaged in additional
price discovery with Party C as directed by the Company Board and that Party C had indicated it would be
willing to increase its bid to $17.75 per share of Class A Common stock in cash, with a purchase price
reduction for any amounts required to be paid to obtain the debt waivers and consents, in exchange for a
two-week exclusivity period. Members of the Company Board discussed whether to grant exclusivity to Party
C on that basis.
Members of the Company Board continued their discussion from the prior meeting regarding the
advantages and risks of continuing to operate as a stand-alone company or pursuing a potential YieldCo
transaction given recently increased volatility in the then current macroeconomic environment, continued
uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic conditions in the near- and long-term, and industry headwinds
facing the Company (each of which could negatively affect the Company’s financial performance),
particularly in light of rising inflation and interest rates and challenges that financial sponsors were generally
encountering in the then current financing markets. A representative of Cravath also provided an overview
46 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the status of negotiations on the definitive documentation for a transaction with Party C, noting, among
other things, that while there remained certain open legal points to negotiate with Party C, such points could
potentially be resolved during an exclusivity period of approximately two weeks. Following such discussion,
the Company Board directed Mr. Berkman, Mr. King and the representatives of Citi and Goldman to drive
Party C to further increase its proposed purchase and show additional movement on contractual terms, while
granting Messrs. Berkman and King and the Company Board’s advisors the authority to negotiate an
exclusivity agreement with Party C if Party C increased its proposed purchase price to not less than $17.75
per share of Class A Common Stock.
Later on August 23, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman held a telephone call with representatives
of Party C to discuss valuation and each of Mr. Berkman and Mr. King held separate telephone calls with
representatives of Party C to discuss valuation. At the conclusion of the telephone call among Mr. Berkman,
Mr. King and representatives of Party C, the Company and Party C had reached a tentative agreement on a
revised purchase price of $18.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash (without a purchase price
reduction for any amounts required to be paid to obtain the debt waivers and consents) and an agreement to
enter into a two-week exclusivity period provided the parties could resolve certain other key contractual
terms, including the specific amounts of termination fees payable under certain circumstances contemplated
by Party C and the Company and certain issues regarding debt defaults, restricted remedies and the debt
waivers and consents. Following the telephone call, representatives of Cravath sent to the representatives of
Party C’s counsel an initial draft of an exclusivity agreement.
Between August 23, 2022 and August 25, 2022, the Company and Party C tentatively agreed on certain
terms, including the specific amounts of termination fees to be payable by the parties to each other under
certain circumstances and representatives of Cravath and Party C’s counsel negotiated the terms of the
exclusivity agreement, which was entered into by the Company and Party C on August 25, 2022 and provided
Party C exclusivity until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 9, 2022 (which exclusivity period was
subsequently extended by the Company several times, ultimately to October 4, 2022, in light of the parties’
then ongoing good faith negotiations of the Party C Merger Agreement as more fully described below).
On August 24, 2022, the Transaction Committee and Barclays executed Barclays’ engagement letter.
On August 25, 2022, representatives of Citi held a telephone call with representatives of PSP to inform
PSP that the Company had entered into an exclusivity agreement with another bidder.
On September 2, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting with representatives of Morris Nichols
and Barclays in attendance, at which meeting the Transaction Committee (a) authorized Company
management to consent to Party C and PSP discussing PSP potentially providing equity financing in
connection with Party C’s proposed WholeCo transaction and (b) consented to representatives of Party C
and Party C’s outside counsel having high-level discussions with certain members of Company management
and their respective outside counsel, subject to compliance with the June 2022 Guidelines, regarding
potential terms of rollover arrangements and post-closing employment arrangements that such individuals
would consider entering into in connection with Party C’s proposed WholeCo transaction.
On September 7, 2022, members of Company management, Ashley Leeds, member of the Company Board
and Transaction Committee, and representatives of Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morris Nichols, on the one
hand, and representatives of Party C met for dinner in New York City for introductory purposes. During the
rest of September 2022 and October 2022, Party C and Party C’s outside counsel, on the one hand, and
certain members of Company management and their respective counsel, on the other hand, discussed the
structure and principal terms of their potential rollover arrangements.
On September 9, 2022, the Company and Citi executed Citi’s engagement letter, and on September 11,
2022, the Company and Goldman Sachs executed Goldman Sachs’ engagement letter.
In September 2022 and October 2022, representatives of Cravath and Party C’s outside counsel
negotiated and exchanged drafts of the Party C Merger Agreement, the debt waivers and consents, voting
and support agreements to be entered into by certain Company Stockholders, the equity commitment letter
for Party C’s equity financing and limited guarantee supporting Party C’s obligation to pay a termination fee
to the Company under certain circumstances contemplated by the Party C Merger Agreement. During this
47 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
period, the Company continued to negotiate the debt waivers and consents with its lenders and Party C
negotiated equity financing with PSP and certain other co-investors, as well as debt financing with certain
other financing sources.
On September 26, 2022, EQT submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire the Company for
$16.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash. EQT indicated to representatives of Citi that it had
committed equity financing from its affiliated funds, but that it also had a desire to explore and evaluate
potential co-investors.
On September 27, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi and Goldman Sachs in
attendance, to discuss the latest developments with Party C and EQT. A representative of Citi noted that the
Company had entered into an exclusivity agreement with Party C on the basis of the parties’ tentative
agreement on a purchase price of $18.00 per share of Class A Common Stock, which had subsequently been
extended until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 27, 2022 at that time; Company management and the
Company Board’s advisors had been working with Party C to resolve open items in the Party C Merger
Agreement; and Party C had indicated that its three co-investors (including PSP) had also substantially
completed their review of the proposed WholeCo transaction. The representative of Citi also noted that EQT
had submitted a proposal on September 26, 2022 to acquire the Company in a WholeCo transaction for $16.00
per share of Class A Common Stock in cash.
A representative of Cravath then summarized for the Company Board the open legal issues in the draft
Party C Merger Agreement that was being negotiated with Party C, highlighted the extensive negotiation that
had occurred with respect to provisions regarding debt defaults, restricted remedies and waiver agreements
during the exclusivity period. The Company Board discussed whether the existing exclusivity arrangement
with Party C should be terminated to permit the Company to explore a potential transaction with EQT. The
Company Board considered that, even if the Company were to engage with EQT at this time, it would likely
take EQT several additional weeks to advance due diligence and negotiation of definitive documentation to
stages that were equivalent to what had been achieved with Party C to date at that time; the possibility that
Party C may reduce its proposed purchase price to amount lower than $18.00 per share of Class A Common
Stock in cash, even if it remained in exclusivity, in light of then current macroeconomic developments, highly
volatile financial markets and uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic conditions in the near term and
the long term, (each of which could negatively affect the Company’s financial performance); and that, even if
the Company were not to engage directly in discussions with EQT at that time, the prospect of a competing
bid could provide an avenue for accelerating the finalization of discussions with Party C and extracting
additional concessions on certain key transaction points that remained open for negotiation.
After assessing the advantages and risks, the Company Board directed management to continue
discussions with Party C under exclusivity until October 3, 2022 or October 4, 2022, subject to Company
management’s discretion, and to try to use the prospect of termination of the exclusivity period to seek
concessions from Party C on terms for the definitive documentation.
On September 29, 2022, on behalf of the Company, Cravath sent to Party C’s outside counsel a written
notice of the Company’s election not to extend the exclusivity period with Party C beyond 11:59 p.m., Eastern
Time, on October 4, 2022 and that termination of the exclusivity agreement would occur at such time.
On October 4, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi and Goldman Sachs in
attendance. The Company Board discussed the latest developments with respect to Party C and EQT.
Representatives of Citi noted that Company management had extended Party C’s exclusivity period until
11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 4, 2022 and that Citi had explained to Party C that if Party C were unable
to agree to terms by such time, the Company Board would need to engage with other potential bidders. A
representative of Cravath noted that Party C had not yet requested an extension of exclusivity and then
proceeded to summarize for the Company Board the status of the open legal points in the definitive
documentation. The Company Board discussed potential avenues to put further pressure on Party C to
finalize terms that did not involve an extension of the exclusivity period and whether to engage with EQT
upon the termination of the exclusivity period with Party C. At the conclusion of such discussion, the
48 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company Board determined that the course of action that would be in the best interest of Company
Stockholders would be for the Company to finalize a transaction with Party C at $18.00 per share of Class A
Common Stock in cash and to grant Company management the authority to extend exclusivity with Party C, if
so requested, at its discretion if Company management believed based on ongoing negotiations that such an
extension would best position the Company to reach that objective. Additionally, the Company Board
granted authority to management to reach out to EQT in the event that the exclusivity period with Party C
terminated.
At 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 4, 2022, the exclusivity period with Party C expired and the
exclusivity agreement terminated pursuant to its terms.
On October 6, 2022, representatives of Citi contacted and reengaged with EQT to discuss its revised
proposal for a WholeCo transaction and to inform EQT that the Company had been exclusive with another
party and that while the Company was still engaging with that party in good faith, such engagement was no
longer on an exclusive basis. A representative of EQT indicated that EQT remained interested in pursuing a
WholeCo transaction and would continue to engage in discussions with the Company and its financial and
legal advisors regarding a WholeCo transaction, but that EQT was no longer prepared to proceed on the
basis of a purchase price for the Company of $16.00 per share of Class A Common Stock.
On October 7, 2022, Party C informed the Company and Citi that it was declining to proceed with its
proposal to acquire the Company in a WholeCo transaction for $18.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in
cash, in part, due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions that had occurred since the parties reached a
tentative agreement on purchase price.
On October 23, 2022, a representative of EQT contacted representatives of Citi to schedule a telephone
call to discuss EQT’s continued interest in pursuing a WholeCo transaction. Also on that date,
representatives of Citi contacted Party A to inquire if it were interested in reengaging in discussions
regarding a potential WholeCo transaction.
On October 24, 2022, the Company received from Party C a written proposal to acquire the Company in a
WholeCo transaction for $12.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash. Party C’s outside counsel sent
to Cravath a revised draft of the Party C Merger Agreement, which Cravath shared with Morris Nichols, and
revised drafts of the equity commitment letter for Party C’s equity financing and the limited guarantee.
On October 24, 2022, a representative of Citi held telephone calls with representatives of EQT to discuss
potential next steps regarding EQT’s proposal for a WholeCo transaction, including with respect to due
diligence and negotiation of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents.
On October 25, 2022, at the direction of Company management (who had consulted with members of the
Company Board and the Transaction Committee), a representative of Citi had a telephone call with a
representative of Party C to inform Party C that the Company would not continue to engage with Party C on
the basis of a WholeCo transaction for $12.00 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash.
On October 26, 2022, EQT’s access to the virtual data room containing information about the Company
that had been established in connection with the WholeCo transaction process was reinstated. Also on that
date, representatives of Citi held a telephone call with representatives of Party A to discuss their interest in
pursuing a WholeCo transaction.
On October 28, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols and Citi in attendance, at which
meeting the Company Board discussed the status of each of EQT’s and Party A’s interest in pursuing a
WholeCo transaction.
On October 31, 2022, Company management and representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs, on the one
hand, and representatives of EQT, on the other hand, held a telephone call to discuss certain due diligence
matters regarding a WholeCo transaction.
On October 31, 2022, Cravath sent to Simpson a revised draft of the Merger Agreement.
49 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 3, 2022, Party A informed representatives of Citi that it was declining to submit a written
proposal for a WholeCo transaction and that, although Party A continued to believe in the potential strategic
rationale of a combination with the Company, Party A was not prepared to move forward with a transaction
given its preference to use its stock as part of the transaction consideration and the then current market
price of its stock.
On November 4, 2022, the Company received from EQT a revised written proposal to acquire the
Company in a WholeCo transaction for $14.25 per share of Class A Common Stock in cash. At this time, EQT
indicated that, while it had the ability to fund the entire equity requirement at its proposed purchase price, it
would prefer to include co-investors and may be able to increase its proposed purchase price if permitted to
do so.
On November 4, 2022, a representative of PSP contacted representatives of Citi to indicate that Party C
had released PSP to explore opportunities for co-investment in a WholeCo transaction with other parties.
On November 6, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs had a telephone call with
representatives of EQT to discuss their latest proposal for a WholeCo transaction.
On November 8, 2022, the Company Board held a meeting by videoconference with members of senior
management of the Company and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Citi and Goldman Sachs in
attendance. The Company Board’s financial and legal advisors reviewed with the Company Board the latest
proposal received from EQT, its request for exclusivity and its indication that it may be able to increase its
proposed purchase price if permitted to include a co-investor. Thereafter, the Company Board discussed
potential next steps to take with EQT, including with respect to if and when to permit EQT to have
discussions with potential co-investors, and how such next steps could best be deployed to drive EQT to
increase its proposed purchase price. Additionally, the Company Board again reviewed the relative merits
and considerations of pursuing strategic alternatives other than a WholeCo transaction, including
continuing as a stand-alone company, the potential purchase price at which the Company Board may agree
to a WholeCo transaction given then prevailing market and macroeconomic conditions and whether in light
of these various considerations it was advisable to continue the WholeCo transaction process given its

Company’s business and execution of its other strategic initiatives.
On November 8, 2022 and November 9, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs, at the direction

Goldman Sachs had identified a potential co-investor for EQT.
On November 9, 2022, representatives of Citi and Goldman Sachs held a telephone call with
representatives of PSP to inform them the Company was in discussions with a party other than Party C
regarding a WholeCo transaction and that there may be a potential co-investment opportunity in connection
therewith.

sponsor regarding a WholeCo transaction.
On November 11, 2022, Mr. Berkman, Mr. Bruce and Mr. Judson, on the one hand, met with

proceed with a WholeCo transaction and to inform them that the potential co-investor Citi and Goldman
Sachs had identified was PSP.
On November 14, 2022, the Company received from EQT a revised written proposal to acquire the
Company in a WholeCo transaction for cash consideration in the range of $14.75 to $15.25 per share of

Class A Common Stock in cash, along with an issues list for the Merger Agreement. Open issues included,
among other things, the purchase price, the specific amount of the minimum cash condition, certain

and consents, certain other issues regarding regulatory efforts, deal protection, the interim operating
covenants and certain of the Company’s representations and warranties.

and other aspects of EQT’s proposal over the course of the following three weeks.
On November 29, 2022, the Company received from a potential strategic buyer that we refer to as “Party
M” an unsolicited written indication of interest to acquire certain of the Company’s assets in a few specific
geographies. Party M’s indication of interest in such asset sale transaction was unsolicited. The Company
Board was notified of Party M’s indication of interest after receipt thereof. In light of the Company Board’s
direction to continue engaging with EQT in connection with a WholeCo transaction, and given that
Company management believed at that time that certain structural features of Party M’s proposed
transaction would not constitute an attractive source of funding for the Company to execute on its strategy
as a stand-alone company and would reduce the Company’s scale, the Company did not engage with Party
M in connection with Party M’s proposed transaction.

"Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc._20230505_DEFM14A_20858042_4661091.Pdf",Recommendation of the Company Board and Reasons for the Mergers,"Recommendation of the Company Board and Reasons for the Mergers
Recommendation of the Company Board
The Company Board and the Transaction Committee carefully reviewed and considered the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement, including the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Company
Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction Committee, has unanimously: (a) determined
that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
the Company Stockholders, (b) duly authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of such transactions, (c) declared the Merger
Agreement and such transactions are advisable and (d) recommended that the Company Stockholders adopt the
Merger Agreement.
The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2)
“FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Reasons for the Mergers
As described in the section titled “- Background of the Mergers” beginning on page 38 of this proxy
statement, in evaluating the Mergers, the Company Board held numerous meetings, consulted with and
received the advice of representatives of the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, held
discussions with the Company’s senior management and considered the business, assets and liabilities,
results of operations, financial performance, strategic direction and prospects of the Company. In addition,
the Transaction Committee separately evaluated the Mergers, held numerous meetings and consulted with
and received the advice of representatives of the Transaction Committee’s outside legal counsel and
financial advisor. In making its determination, the Company Board considered a number of factors that it
believed supported its decision to enter into the Merger Agreement and to recommend its adoption by
Company Stockholders. In making its determination, the Transaction Committee considered a number of
factors that it believed supported its conclusion that the Mergers were in the best interests of the Company
and Company Stockholders, including its disinterested stockholders, and its decision to recommend that the
Company Board adopt the Merger Agreement and the related transactions. These factors included, but were
not limited to, the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
Merger Consideration; Premium to the Trading Price of Class A Common Stock. The Company Board and
the Transaction Committee considered the current and historical market prices of Class A Common
Stock, including the market performance of Class A Common Stock relative to that of other
participants in the Company’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger
Consideration represented:
a premium of approximately 28.0% based on the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock
of $11.72 on February 24, 2023, the last full trading day prior to reports that EQT was nearing a
deal to acquire the Company;
55 • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
a premium of approximately 13.8% based on the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) per
share of Class A Common Stock for the 30 trading-day period ended February 24, 2023 (“30-day
VWAP”) of $13.18;
a premium of approximately 30.8% based on the VWAP per share of Class A Common Stock for
the 90 trading-day period ended February 24, 2023 (“90-day VWAP”) of $11.46; and
a premium of approximately 74.6% based on the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock
of $8.59 on November 8, 2022, the date Radius announced its third fiscal quarter earnings.
Risks Relating to Remaining a Standalone Company. The Company Board and the Transaction
Committee evaluated the Company’s long-term strategic plan were it to remain an independent public
company, as well as the significant risks associated with executing such plan. This evaluation
included the Company Board’s and the Transaction Committee’s review of the Company’s business,
operations, financial condition, earnings, prospects, competitive position and the nature of the
industry in which the Company competes, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified)
of those factors on the trading price of the Company’s common stock. The Company Board and the
Transaction Committee ultimately determined that the certainty of value provided by the acquisition
of the Company by Parent for the Merger Consideration was more favorable to Company
Stockholders than the risk-adjusted value of remaining an independent public company, after
accounting for the risks and uncertainties that the Company would face if it continued to operate on a
standalone public company basis, as described under the section of this proxy statement titled
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.
Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The Company Board and the Transaction Committee
considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, which will provide Company
Stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Company Capital Stock,
enables Company Stockholders to realize value that has been created by Radius and does not expose
them to any future risks related to the business or macroeconomic conditions, as compared to Radius
remaining independent.
No Financing Condition and Committed Equity Financing. The Company Board and the Transaction
Committee considered the fact that the Mergers are not subject to a financing condition, the
Sponsors have committed to make available and provide to Parent, pursuant to equity commitment
letters, the full amount in cash necessary, together with available cash on hand at the Company of not
less than $210,000,000 and the Rollover Amount, to pay the amounts required to be paid in
connection with, or as a result of, the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Company Board and the Transaction Committee also
considered the fact that the Sponsors have provided termination equity commitment letters in favor of
Parent to fund its obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee that may become payable to the
Company under certain circumstances, as described in more detail under the section of this proxy
statement titled “- Financing of the Mergers”.
Benefits of an Acquisition by Financial Sponsors. The Company Board and the Transaction Committee
considered the possibility that an infrastructure fund or other private financial sponsor might be able
to realize more value from the business than a public company buyer and thereby pay a higher price
to acquire the Company, including the ability to absorb near-term dilution from (a) potential equity
capital required to fund growth and (b) capital expenditures in favor of longer-term growth and to
fund developments without having to rely on the volatility of equity capital markets. For a detailed
discussion of the Company Board’s and the Transaction Committee’s assessment of potential
counterparties, please see above under the heading titled “- Background of the Mergers”.
The Company’s Operating and Financial Condition and Prospects. The Company Board and the
Transaction Committee considered the Company’s operating and financial performance and its
prospects, including certain prospective forecasts for the Company prepared by the Company’s
senior management, which reflect an application of various assumptions of senior management. The
Company Board and the Transaction Committee considered the challenges that senior management
face in creating prospective forecasts (due to the difficulties associated with predicting the amount
56 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
of future acquisitions and the prices to be paid for such acquisitions) and the inherent uncertainty of
achieving such prospective forecasts, as set forth under the heading titled “- Certain Financial
Forecasts”, and that as a result, the Company’s actual financial results in future periods could differ
materially from senior management’s forecasts.
Best Alternative for Maximizing Company Stockholder Value. After a review of a range of alternatives
and discussions with management and the Company’s financial and legal advisors, the Company
Board and the Transaction Committee determined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to
the Company Stockholders than the potential value that might result from other options available,
including, but not limited to, remaining a standalone public company or pursuing a YieldCo
transaction (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “- Background of the Mergers”).
As part of these evaluations, the Company Board and the Transaction Committee considered an
assessment of the Company’s business, assets, prospects, competitive position, historical and
projected financial performance, short- and long-term capital needs and the nature of the industries in
which the Company competes as well as the significant risks and uncertainties associated with
remaining a standalone public company.
Dual-Track Process. The Company Board and the Transaction Committee considered its dual-track
process for soliciting and responding to offers from third parties that were believed to be the most
willing and able to pay the highest price for a minority investment in the case of a YieldCo transaction
or the Company in the case of an acquisition of the Company, which included providing such parties
with an opportunity to conduct due diligence and conduct management sessions with members of the
Company’s management, as described in the section of this proxy statement titled “- Background of
the Mergers”.
Citi’s, Goldman Sachs’ and Barclays’ Fairness Opinions and Related Financial Analyses. The Company
Board and the Transaction Committee, as applicable, considered:
the financial analysis reviewed and discussed with the Company Board by representatives of
Citi, and the oral opinion rendered by Citi to the Company Board, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date
of Citi’s written opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi
as set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of Class A Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders;
the financial analysis reviewed and discussed with the Company Board by representatives of
Goldman Sachs, and the oral opinion rendered by Goldman Sachs to the Company Board, which
was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the effect
that, as of the date of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion and based on and subject to the factors
and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other
than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders; and
the financial analysis reviewed and discussed with the Transaction Committee by
representatives of Barclays, and the oral opinion of Barclays, which was subsequently confirmed
in writing, to the Transaction Committee that, as of the date of Barclays’ opinion and based upon
and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, from a
financial point of view, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
Class A Common Stock (other than the executive officers of the Company and the Excluded
Stockholders) in the Mergers is fair to such holders.
For more information, see the sections beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement titled “-",65,72

Radius retained Citi as its lead financial advisor in connection with a possible transaction involving
Radius. In connection with Citi’s engagement, the Company Board requested that Citi evaluate the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock of the Merger
Consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Merger Agreement. On March 1, 2023, at a meeting of the Company Board held to evaluate the proposed
Mergers, Citi rendered to the Company Board an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of Citi’s written opinion and based on
and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and
qualifications on the review undertaken by Citi as set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration
to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.
The full text of Citi’s written opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the Board, which sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on
the review undertaken by Citi in rendering its opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The summary of Citi’s opinion set forth below is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of Citi’s opinion. Citi’s opinion was rendered to the Board (in its
capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Mergers and was limited to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, as of the date of Citi’s written opinion, to holders of shares of Class A
Common Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Citi’s opinion did not address any other terms,
aspects or implications of the proposed Mergers. Citi’s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of
Radius to effect or enter into the proposed Mergers, the relative merits of the proposed Mergers as compared to any
alternative business strategies that might have existed for Radius or the effect of any other transaction in which
Radius might have engaged or considered. Citi’s opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the
proposed Mergers or otherwise.

In rendering its opinion, Citi assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy
and completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or
otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi and upon the assurances of the management of Radius that
they were not aware of any relevant information that was omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citi. With
respect to financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Radius provided to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with Citi, Citi was advised by the management of Radius, and Citi assumed, with
the consent of the Company Board, that such financial forecasts and other information and data were
reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments
of the management of Radius as to, and are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate, the future financial
performance of Radius and the other matters covered thereby. Citi expressed no view or opinion as to any
financial forecasts and other information or data (or underlying assumptions on which any such financial
forecasts and other information or data are based) provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with
Citi.
Citi had assumed, with the consent of the Company Board, that the Mergers will be consummated in
accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, without waiver,
modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining
the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the Mergers, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Radius or the
Mergers or that otherwise would be meaningful to Citi’s opinion or analysis. Representatives of Radius had
advised Citi, and Citi further assumed, with the consent of the Company Board, that the final terms of the
Merger Agreement would not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by Citi. Citi had not
made or been provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent,
accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of Radius or any other entity nor had Citi made any
physical inspection of the properties or assets of Radius or any other entity. Citi had not evaluated the
solvency or fair value of Radius or any other entity under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Citi also did not express any view or opinion as to the prices at
which the Class A Common Stock or any other securities would trade or otherwise be transferable at any
time, including following the announcement of the Mergers. Citi did not express any view or opinion with
respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, as to tax or other
consequences of the Mergers or otherwise or changes in, or the impact of, accounting standards or tax and
other laws, regulations and governmental and legislative policies affecting Radius or the Mergers (including
the contemplated benefits thereof), and Citi relied, with the consent of the Company Board, upon the
assessments of representatives of Radius as to such matters.
Citi’s opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of its written
opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, without regard to individual circumstances of holders of the Class A Common
Stock that may distinguish such holders or the securities of Radius held by such holders, and did not
address any other terms, aspects or implications of the Mergers, including, without limitation, the form or
structure of the Mergers and the Rollover Agreements and any consideration payable in connection
therewith, the allocation of the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement among
the holders of, or the treatment or cancellation for no consideration of, the various types of shares of capital
stock of Radius or any of its subsidiaries, or any terms, aspects or implications of any agreement,
arrangement or understanding to be entered into or amended or modified in connection with or
63 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
contemplated by the Mergers, or the amount thereof relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Citi
expressed no view as to, and Citi’s opinion did not address, the underlying business decision of Radius to
effect or enter into the Mergers, the relative merits of the Mergers as compared to any alternative business
strategies that might exist for Radius or the effect of any other transaction in which Radius might engage or
consider. Citi also expressed no view as to, and Citi’s opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or
otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation or other consideration to any
officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Mergers, or any class of such persons, relative to the
Merger Consideration or otherwise. Citi’s opinion is necessarily based upon information available to Citi,
and financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing and disclosed to Citi, as of the
date of its written opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect Citi’s opinion, Citi has no
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. As the Company Board was aware, the credit, financial
and stock markets, the industries in which Radius operates and the securities of Radius have experienced
and may continue to experience volatility and Citi expressed no view or opinion as to any potential effects of
such volatility on Radius or the Mergers (including the contemplated benefits thereof).
In preparing its opinion, Citi performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those
described below. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. Citi arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses
undertaken by it and factors assessed as a whole, and it did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with
regard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion.
In its analyses, Citi considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its written opinion, many of which are beyond the
control of Radius. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to
Radius or the Mergers and an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses
involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other
factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or
transactions reviewed or the results of any particular analysis.
The estimates used by Citi for purposes of its analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any
particular analysis were not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition,
analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in,
and the results derived from, Citi’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
Citi was not requested to, and it did not, recommend or determine the specific consideration payable in
the proposed Mergers. The type and amount of consideration payable in the proposed Mergers were
determined through negotiations Radius, on the one hand, and Parent and its affiliates, on the other hand,
and Radius’ decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Board. Citi’s opinion was
only one of many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of the proposed Mergers and
should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company Board or the management of Radius with
respect to the proposed Mergers, the Merger Consideration or any other aspect of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared for and reviewed with the
Company Board in connection with Citi’s opinion, dated March 1, 2023, to the Company Board. The summary
set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by, and underlying the
opinion of, Citi, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight
given to those financial analyses by Citi. Certain financial analyses summarized below include information presented
in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary as the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the
data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the financial
64 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses. Future results may be different from
those described and such differences may be material. Approximate implied equity value per share reference
ranges derived from the financial analyses described below and other per share ranges presented for
reference purposes only were rounded to the nearest $0.05, except for data relating to intraday trading share
prices. Except as otherwise noted, financial data utilized for Radius in the financial analyses described below
were based on the December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts as indicated and other information and
data relating to Radius provided to or discussed with Citi and approved for Citi’s use by the Company Board
and as further summarized in the section titled “- Certain Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 81.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Citi conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of Radius using the December 31, 2023 - 2032
Management Forecasts (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “- Certain Financial
Forecasts”), in which Citi calculated the estimated present value (as of December 31, 2022) of the standalone
unlevered after-tax free cash flows that Radius was forecasted to generate during calendar year 2023 through
calendar year 2032 as reflected in the December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts. For purposes of this
analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Based on its professional judgment and
experience, Citi calculated terminal values for Radius at the end of the projection period by applying a
selected range of perpetuity growth rates of 3.00% to 3.50% (which Citi derived by utilizing its professional
judgment and experience and taking into consideration, among other factors, Radius management’s views
regarding future growth, as well as long-term growth expectations for the industry and trend in the overall
economy generally) to the standalone unlevered after-tax fee cash flows of Radius in the terminal year as
reflected in the December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts. Citi then discounted to present value (as of
December 31, 2022) the standalone unlevered after-tax free cash flows and implied estimated terminal value
using discount rates ranging from 7.90% to 8.60%, derived from a calculation of the weighted average cost of
capital of Radius, which Citi performed utilizing the capital asset pricing model with inputs that Citi
determined were relevant based on publicly available data and Citi’s professional judgment. This analysis
indicated an implied firm value reference range for Radius of approximately $1,913 million to $3,072 million.
From this range of implied firm values, Citi subtracted Radius’ net debt as of December 31, 2022 (calculated
as debt less cash) and the present value as of December 31, 2022 of Series A Founder Preferred Stock implied
annual dividends calculated by Citi based on theoretical future prices for the shares of Class A Common
Stock calculated by Citi at a cap rate of 5.9% as described in the section below titled “- Present Value of
Future Share Price Analysis” and discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 7.90% to
8.60%, and divided the results by the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding on a fully
diluted basis as of February 28, 2023, calculated using the treasury stock method, based on information
provided by Radius management. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity
value reference range for Radius, as compared to the Merger Consideration:
Implied per Share Equity Value Reference Range
Merger
Consideration
$5.95 - $15.95
$15.00
Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Citi performed an analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Class A Common
Stock as of December 31, 2022 based on theoretical future prices calculated by Citi for the shares of Class A
Common Stock based on the December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts. Citi derived a range of
theoretical future values per share for the shares of Class A Common Stock as of December 31 of each of
calendar years 2023 through 2032 by applying illustrative cap rates of 5.2% to 5.9% to estimates of the
adjusted annualized in-place rent of Radius for each of calendar years 2023 through 2032, as reflected in the
December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts. The cap rates used by Citi were derived based on Citi’s
professional judgment and experience and reflected the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, of Radius’
trading cap rates on annualized in-place rent during the twelve-month period ended February 24, 2023. By
applying a discount rate of 12.1%, reflecting a mid-point estimate of Radius’ cost of equity, Citi discounted to
present value as of December 31, 2022 the theoretical future values per share it derived for Radius as
described above, to yield a range of illustrative present values per share of Class A Common Stock. This

analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Radius, as
compared to the Merger Consideration.

Other Information
Citi observed certain other information with respect to Radius that was not considered part of its
financial analyses with respect to its opinion, but was noted for reference purposes only, including the
following:
Historical Stock Trading. Citi reviewed historical intraday trading prices of Class A Common Stock for the
52-week period ended February 24, 2023, which indicated an overall low to high intraday trading share
price range of $7.97 to $16.52 per share over the period.
Precedent Premiums Paid. Citi reviewed publicly available data relating to premiums paid in all-cash U.S.
publicly traded company transactions announced between 2012 and 2022, with transaction values between
$1 billion and $10 billion (excluding transactions involving financial institutions as targets). Citi applied a
selected range of one-day premiums of 20% to 40% (derived, based on Citi’s professional judgment and
experience, from the premiums paid in such transactions over the target companies involved in such
transactions unaffected closing stock price) to (a) to the closing price of Class A Common Stock of $11.72
per share on February 24, 2023, and (ii) to the closing price of Class A Common Stock of $8.59 per share on
November 8, 2022, the closing price prior to Radius’ third fiscal quarter earnings announcement date, imply
approximate per share equity value reference ranges for Radius of (i) $14.05 to $16.40 per share, and (ii)
$10.30 to $12.05 per share, respectively.
Miscellaneous
Radius has agreed to pay Citi for its services in connection with the Mergers an aggregate fee of
approximately $21,300,000, of which $2,500,000 was payable upon delivery of Citi’s opinion to the Company
Board and the remainder is payable contingent upon consummation of the Mergers. The Company may pay
Citi an additional discretionary fee of up to $5,000,000 based upon the Company Board’s assessment of Citi’s
work in connection with its engagement. In addition, Radius agreed to reimburse Citi for Citi’s reasonable
expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, and to indemnify Citi and related parties against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws, arising out of Citi’s engagement.
As the Company Board was aware, although Citi and its affiliates have not provided investment
banking, commercial banking, capital raising or other similar financial services to Radius and/or its affiliates
unrelated to the proposed Mergers during the past two years for which Citi and its affiliates received
compensation, Citi and its affiliates in the future may provide such services to Radius and/or its affiliates, for
which services Citi and its affiliates would expect to receive compensation. As the Company Board was also
aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided, and currently are providing, investment banking,
commercial banking and other similar financial services to EQT and its affiliates and controlled portfolio
companies, for which services Citi and its affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation,
including, without limitation, during the two-year period prior to the date of Citi’s written opinion, having
acted as financial advisor in connection with certain merger and acquisition transactions involving
controlled portfolio companies of EQT, as bookrunner or arranger in connection with certain bond issuances,
loans and credit facilities of controlled portfolio companies of EQT, as ratings advisor to a controlled
portfolio company of EQT and as lender in connection with certain loans of EQT. For the services described
above for EQT and its affiliates, Citi and its affiliates received, during the two-year period prior to the date of
Citi’s written opinion, aggregate fees of approximately $12 million, as determined by Citi based on its books
and records. As the Company Board was also aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided, and
currently are providing, investment banking, commercial banking and other similar financial services to PSP
and its affiliates and controlled portfolio companies, for which services Citi and its affiliates have received
and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, during the two-year period prior to the
date of Citi’s written opinion, having acted as joint lead arranger and bookrunner in connection with certain
bond offerings and as lender in connection with certain loans of PSP and its affiliates. For the services
described

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
above for PSP and its affiliates, Citi and its affiliates received, during the two-year period prior to the date of
Citi’s written opinion, aggregate fees of approximately $1 million, as determined by Citi based on its books
and records. In the ordinary course of Citi’s business, Citi and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the
securities of Radius for Citi’s own account or for the account of Citi’s customers and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, Citi and its affiliates (including
Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with Radius and its affiliates.
Radius selected Citi to act as lead financial advisor in connection with the proposed Mergers based on
Citi’s reputation, experience and familiarity with Radius and its businesses. Citi is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm that regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities
in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and
other purposes.",72,77
"Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc._20230505_DEFM14A_20858042_4661091.Pdf",Opinion of Goldman Sachs,"Opinion of Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Company Board that, as of March 1, 2023 and based upon
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 1, 2023, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of
the Company Board in connection with its consideration of the Mergers. Goldman Sachs’ opinion is not a
recommendation as to how any holder of Class A Common Stock should vote with respect to the Mergers, or any other
matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,
Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:
the Merger Agreement;
annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Radius for the two years ended
December 31, 2021;
Radius’ Registration Statement on Form S-4, including the prospectus contained therein dated
October 5, 2020 relating, among other things, to the issuance of Class A Common Stock;
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Radius and certain
other communications from Radius to Company Stockholders;
certain publicly available research analyst reports for Radius; and
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as
approved by the Company for Goldman Sachs’ use, including the December 31, 2023 - 2032
Management Forecasts, (referenced in this section of the proxy statement titled “- Opinion of
Goldman Sachs” as the “Forecasts”). See the section titled “- Certain Financial Forecasts”.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Radius regarding their
assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Radius;
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Class A Common Stock; compared certain
financial and stock market information for Radius with similar information for certain other companies the
securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations
in the technology, media and telecommunications (“TMT”) industry; and performed such other studies and
analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Company Board, relied
upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting
and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for
independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent
67 TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the Company Board that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Radius. Goldman Sachs did not make an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or
other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Radius or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished
with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Mergers will be obtained without any
adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Mergers in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs
also assumed that the Mergers will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without
the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its
analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Radius to engage in the
Mergers or the relative merits of the Mergers as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available
to Radius; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates)
of Class A Common Stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such
holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does
not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Mergers or any term or aspect of any
other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in
connection with the Mergers, including the allocation of the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to
the Merger Agreement among the holders of, or the cancellation for no consideration of, the various types of
shares of Company Capital Stock or any of its subsidiaries, the OpCo Merger and the Rollover Agreements
and any consideration payable in connection therewith, and the fairness of the Mergers to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities (including the
Series A Founder Preferred Stock, the OpCo Common Units and the Rollover Equity), creditors, or other
constituencies of Radius; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Radius, or class of such persons in connection with
the Mergers, whether relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and
its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman
Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs
assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances,
developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express
any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Class A Common Stock will trade at any time, as to the
potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Radius, Parent or the Mergers, or as
to the impact of the Mergers on the solvency or viability of Radius or Parent or the ability of Radius or
Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and
opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Company Board in connection with its
consideration of the Mergers and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder
of shares of Class A Common Stock should vote or act with respect to such Mergers or any other matter.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.
Summary of Material Financial Analysis
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the
Company Board in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary,
however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman
Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those
analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented
in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a
complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on
or before February 28, 2023, the last trading day before the public announcement of the Mergers, and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Radius
to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Class A Common Stock. For purposes of this
68 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Using the mid-year convention for
discounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 7.9% to 8.7%, reflecting estimates of Radius’
weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value, as of December 31, 2022, (i)
estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Radius for the calendar years 2023 through 2032, as reflected in the
Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Radius, which were calculated by applying
terminal growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow
to be generated by Radius, as reflected in the Forecasts (which analysis implied annualized in-place rent
yield of 5.5% to 7.1%). The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its
professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding
long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates
by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”), which requires certain company-specific
inputs, including Radius’ target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on
permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Radius, as well as
certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Radius by adding the ranges of
present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then derived a range of illustrative equity values for Radius
by subtracting from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Radius (i) the net debt of Radius
as of December 31, 2022 (calculated as debt less cash), as provided and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by
the management of Radius and (ii) the present value, as of December 31, 2022, of Series A Founder Preferred
Stock implied annual dividends calculated by Goldman Sachs based on theoretical future prices for the
shares of Class A Common Stock which were calculated by Goldman Sachs using the Forecasts by applying
a constant cap rate of 6.2% to estimates of Radius’ annualized in-place rent for each of calendar years 2022
through 2026 using the methodology described in the section below titled “-​Illustrative Present Value of
Future Share Price Analysis” and using discount rates ranging from 7.9% to 8.7%, reflecting estimates of
Radius’ weighted average cost of capital. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values
it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock as of February 28,
2023, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Radius, using the treasury
stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Class A Common Stock ranging
from $5.35 to $16.11.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of
an illustrative future value per share of Class A Common Stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs calculated
the implied enterprise value of Radius as of December 31 for each of calendar years 2022 through 2025, by
applying illustrative cap rates ranging from 4.8% to 6.2% to estimates of Radius’ annualized in-place rent for
each of the calendar years 2022 through 2025. This illustrative range of cap rates was derived by Goldman
Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical cap rates
on annualized in-place rent for Radius. Goldman Sachs then subtracted the net debt of Radius for each of
calendar years 2022 through 2025 (calculated as debt less cash), as provided by and approved for Goldman
Sachs’ use by the management of Radius, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a
range of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for Radius for each of calendar years 2022 through
2025. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully
diluted outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock each of calendar years 2022 through 2025, calculated
using information provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by the management of Radius, to
derive a range of implied future values per share of Class A Common Stock. For purposes of this analysis,
both stock-based compensation expense and the Series A Founder Preferred Stock annual dividends were
treated as share issuances.
Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied future equity values per share of Class A Common Stock
to December 31, 2025 using an illustrative discount rate of 11%, reflecting an estimate of Radius’ cost of
equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain
company-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United
States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative present values per share of
Class A Common Stock of $11.42 to $19.51.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for
all-cash acquisition transactions announced during the period from January 1, 2013 through February 24,
2023 involving a public company in the TMT sector based in the United States as the target where the
disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was greater than $1 billion. For the entire period, using
publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile premia
of the price paid in the 149 transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to
announcement of the transaction and the target’s highest closing stock price during the 52-week period prior
to the date of the target’s last undisturbed closing stock price. With respect to the target’s last undisturbed
closing stock price prior to the announcement of the transaction, this analysis indicated an overall premium
of 28%, and a 25th percentile premium of 19% and 75th percentile premium of 46% across the entire period.
With respect to the target’s last undisturbed 52-week high closing stock price prior to the announcement of
the transaction, this analysis indicated an overall premium of 6%, and a 25th percentile premium of negative
5% and 75th percentile premium of 17% across the entire period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied
a reference range of illustrative premia of 19% to 46% to the undisturbed closing price per share of Class A
Common Stock of $11.72 as of February 24, 2023 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of
Class A Common Stock of $13.95 to $17.11.
Historical Stock Trading Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices for shares of Class A Common Stock for the period
beginning January 1, 2022 and ending February 28, 2023. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the Merger
Consideration to be paid to holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger Agreement in relation to (i) the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock on
February 24, 2023, (ii) the high and low closing price per share of Class A Common Stock for the 52-week
period ended February 24, 2023, (iii) the 30-day VWAP, (iv) the 90-day VWAP, and (v) the closing price per
share of Class A Common Stock on November 8, 2022, the date Radius announced its third fiscal quarter
earnings.
This analysis indicated that the price per share to be paid to holders of shares of Class A Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger Agreement represented:
a premium of approximately 28.0% based on the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock of
$11.72 on February 24, 2023;
a premium of approximately 13.8% based on the 30-day VWAP per share of Class A Common Stock of
$13.18;
a premium of approximately 30.8% based on the 90-day VWAP per share of Class A Common Stock of
$11.46; and
a premium of approximately 74.6% based on the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock of
$8.59 on November 8, 2022, the date Radius announced its third fiscal quarter earnings.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,
without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying
Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all
of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Radius or the contemplated transaction.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs’ providing its opinion to the
Company Board as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger Consideration to be paid to
the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices
70 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are
not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based
upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of
Radius, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different
from those forecasts.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Radius and
Parent and was approved by the Company Board. Goldman Sachs did not recommend any specific amount of
consideration to Radius or the Company Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the
only appropriate consideration for the Mergers.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Company Board was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Company Board in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The
foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman
Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written
opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal
investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial
activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and
funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which
they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in
securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments
of Radius, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Centerbridge, a significant
shareholder of Radius, EQT and PSP, each of which is delivering to Parent, through an affiliate, in the case of
EQT, and directly, in the case of PSP, an equity commitment letter and a termination equity financing letter, or
any of their respective affiliates and portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be
involved in the Mergers contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial
advisor to Radius in connection with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the
Mergers. Goldman Sachs expect to receive fees for its services in connection with the Mergers, all of which
are contingent upon consummation of the Mergers, and Radius has agreed to reimburse certain of its
expenses arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that may arise, out of its
engagement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Radius
and/or its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has received, and may
receive, compensation, including having acted as agent in connection with certain loans of AP WIP ArcCo
Investments, LLC, a subsidiary of Radius, in December 2021; as bookrunner with respect to a private
placement of Radius’ 2.50% convertible senior notes due 2026, in September 2021 (the “Convertible Notes”);
and as placement agent with respect to a private placement of Class A Shares of Radius, in May 2021. During
the two-year period ended March 1, 2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial
advisory and/or underwriting services provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking to Radius and/or its
affiliates of approximately $3 million, as determined by Goldman Sachs based on its books and records.
Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Centerbridge
and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking
has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as bookrunner in connection with a
term loan to Precisely Holdings, LLC, a portfolio company of Centerbridge, (“Precisely”), in October 2021;
and as financial advisor to Precisely, in connection with its sale to Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. and TA
Associates, in April 2021. During the two-year period ended March 1, 2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized
compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by Goldman Sachs Investment
Banking to Centerbridge and/or its affiliates of approximately $30 million to $40 million, as determined by
Goldman Sachs based on its books and records. Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial advisory
and/or underwriting services to EQT and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which
Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as
bookrunner with respect to a secondary accelerated bookbuild offering of shares of Azelis Group NV, a
portfolio company of EQT, (“Azelis”), in January 2023; as financial advisor to Facile.it S.p.A., a portfolio
company of EQT, in connection with its sale to Silver Lake, in June 2022; as bookrunner with respect to a
follow on public offering of shares of common stock of Privia Health Group Inc., a portfolio
71 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
company of EQT, in November 2021; as bookrunner with respect to a term loan to Covanta Holding Corp., a
portfolio company of EQT, in November 2021; as financial advisor to SEGRA
, a portfolio company of EQT,
in connection with its sale of its commercial enterprise and carrier business to Cox Communications, Inc., in
October 2021; as bookrunner with respect to the initial public offering of shares of Azelis in September 2021
and equity follow-on offering in September 2022; as bookrunner with respect to a term loan to Recipharm AB
(publ), a portfolio company of EQT, (“Recipharm”), in March 2021; and as financial advisor to EQT in
connection with its acquisition of Recipharm in March 2021. During the two-year period ended March 1,
2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services
provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking to EQT and/or its affiliates of approximately $167 million, as
determined by Goldman Sachs based on its books and records. Goldman Sachs has also provided certain
financial advisory and/or underwriting services to PSP and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time
to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has received, and may receive, compensation. During
the two-year period ended March 1, 2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial
advisory and/or underwriting services provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking to PSP and/or its
affiliates of approximately $27 million, as determined by Goldman Sachs based on its books and records.
Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Radius,
Centerbridge, EQT, PSP and their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio companies, for which
Goldman Sachs Investment Banking may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have
co-invested with Centerbridge, EQT, and/or PSP and their respective affiliates from time to time and may have
invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Centerbridge, EQT and/or PSP from time to time and may
do so in the future.
As the Company Board was aware, concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, Radius
entered into the Capped Call Transactions (as defined below in the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger Agreement - Company Indebtedness”) with Goldman Sachs and three other counterparties
(which we refer to, collectively, as the “capped call counterparties”), each acting as principal for its own
account. The Capped Call Transactions consisted of the purchase by Radius of capped call options with
respect to, collectively, approximately 11,693,201 shares of Class A Common Stock, the aggregate number of
shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Convertible Notes (at the initial conversion rate of 44.2087
shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 in principal amount of the Convertible Notes) (with 40%
purchased from Goldman Sachs). The Convertible Notes had an initial strike price equal to $22.62 per share of
Class A Common Stock, subject to an initial cap price of $34.80 per share of Class A Common Stock. As of
May [•], 2023 100% of the Capped Call Transactions remain outstanding, with a strike price of $22.62 per
share of Class A Common Stock and a cap price of $34.80 per share of Class A Common Stock.
The Capped Call Transactions were intended to offset a portion of the potential dilutive effect on
Company Stockholders of the conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or any potential cash payment in
excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes that Radius may make in connection with a cash
settlement of the Convertible Notes, in each case, up to the cap price. The Capped Call Transactions, upon
the exercise thereof, generally require the capped call counterparties to deliver to Radius a number of shares
of Class A Common Stock (and/or in certain circumstances, at Radius’ election, cash) determined based on
the excess, if any, of the lower of the cap price and the price of the shares of Class A Common Stock at that
time (determined over a period specified in the Capped Call Transactions) over the strike price per share of
Class A Common Stock.
The Capped Call Transactions may be adjusted, exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance
with their terms in connection with certain events, including the announcement or consummation of the
Mergers, which could result in a payment from Goldman Sachs to Radius. In particular, under the terms of the
Capped Call Transactions, each of Goldman Sachs and the other capped call counterparties, each acting
separately as calculation agent under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled in certain
circumstances to make adjustments to the cap price of the call options to reflect the economic effect of the
announcement of such events (including the Mergers) on the Capped Call Transactions. In addition, each of
Goldman Sachs and the other capped call counterparties may, each acting separately as the calculation
agent, determining party or otherwise as principal under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party,
determine such adjustments in respect of such Capped Call Transactions in accordance with their terms,
including on or following consummation or abandonment of such events. In its capacity as
72 
sm
TABLE OF CONTENTS
calculation agent, all actions or exercises of judgment by Goldman Sachs pursuant to the terms of the
Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party must be performed in good faith and a commercially
reasonable manner.
As a result of the Capped Call Transactions, the capped call counterparties are expected to have market
exposure to the price of the shares of Class A Common Stock. It is ordinary practice of the capped call
counterparties to engage in hedging activities to limit their respective market exposure to the price of the
stock underlying privately negotiated equity derivative transactions with issuers of such stock, such as the
Capped Call Transactions. In connection with the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, Goldman
Sachs (and its affiliates) have engaged, and will continue to engage, in accordance with applicable law in
hedging and other market transactions (which may include the entering into or unwinding of various
derivative transactions with respect to Class A Common Stock) that are generally intended to substantially
neutralize Goldman Sachs’ exposure as a result of the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party to
changes in the price per share of Class A Common Stock. Such hedging activity is at Goldman Sachs’ own
risk and may result in a gain or loss to Goldman Sachs that may be greater than or less than the initial
expected contractual benefit to Goldman Sachs under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party. The
amount of any such gain or loss will not be known until the applicable Capped Call Transactions have been
exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs shall have completed all
of its hedge unwind activities. To mitigate the exposure from the Capped Call Transactions, as of May [•],
2023, Goldman Sachs held a net long economic position of approximately one million shares of Class A
Common Stock and was long and short a number of various other options on Class A Common Stock.
Goldman Sachs provided to management of Radius, for the information of the Company Board, materials
that summarized, based on theoretical models, the potential effects of the announcement and of the
consummation of an acquisition of Radius on the Capped Call Transactions to which Goldman Sachs is a
counterparty. The materials included preliminary illustrative analyses by Goldman Sachs’ Investment
Banking Division for a range of stated assumptions regarding takeout prices for shares of Class A Common
Stock and volatilities, as well as based on other reasonable assumptions. In accordance with industry
practice, Goldman Sachs maintains customary institutional information barriers reasonably designed to
prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by personnel in its Investment Banking
Division to the personnel in its Securities Division who are undertaking hedging and other market
transactions with respect to Goldman Sachs’ Capped Call Transactions. In connection with the preparation of
presentations to senior management of Radius and the Company Board, personnel in Goldman Sachs’
Investment Banking Division, including the representatives of Goldman Sachs who have advised Radius in
connection with the Mergers, from time to time, have received or may receive input from personnel in
Goldman Sachs’ Securities Division into how to model, or reports of historical measures or estimates of,
Goldman Sachs’ and/or Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division’s profit and/or loss over certain
measurement periods related to the Capped Call Transactions.
Goldman Sachs has advised Radius that as of May [•], 2023, Goldman Sachs expects to realize a net gain
of up to approximately $7 million with respect to the Capped Call Transactions as a result of the merger, after
giving effect to its hedging activities based on the ordinary hedging practices described above and based on
a range of stated assumptions, including volatilities and other reasonable assumptions. The amount of any
such gain will not be known until the Capped Call Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in
accordance with their terms and Goldman Sachs and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind
activities, and such amount may differ from the estimates provided above.
The indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of
the Capped Call Transactions were included as exhibits to Radius’ Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
SEC on September 7, 2021, which contains additional disclosure regarding the Convertible Notes and a
description of the Capped Call Transactions. All references in this section of this proxy statement to share
counts, conversion prices, cap prices and strike prices are subject to adjustment from time to time in
accordance with the terms of the confirmations relating to the Capped Call Transactions.
The Company Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Mergers.
Pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 11, 2022, Radius engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its

The Transaction Committee engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor in connection with
evaluating a strategic transaction outside of the Company’s ordinary course of business, including a
possible sale of the Company, pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 24, 2022. On March 1, 2023,
Barclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the Transaction
Committee that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and
assumptions stated in its opinion, from a financial point of view, the Merger Consideration to be received by
the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock (other than the executive officers of the Company and the
Excluded Stockholders) in the Mergers is fair to such holders.
The full text of Barclays’ written opinion is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement. Barclays’ written
opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations
upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in
its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays’ opinion and the methodology that Barclays used to render its
opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
Barclays’ opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays’ Valuation and Fairness Opinion
Committee, is addressed to the Transaction Committee, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock (other
than the executive officers of the Company and the Excluded Stockholders) in the Mergers to such holders
and does not constitute a recommendation to any Company Stockholder as to how such holder should vote
with respect to the Mergers or any other matter. The terms of the Mergers were determined through arm’s-
length negotiations between the Company and Parent and were recommended by the Transaction Committee
and unanimously approved by the Company Board. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of
consideration to the Transaction Committee or the Company or that any specific form of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Mergers. Barclays was not requested to address, and
its opinion does not in any manner address, the Company’s underlying business decision to proceed with or
effect the Mergers, the likelihood of the consummation of the Mergers, or the relative merits of the Mergers
as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company may engage. In addition,
Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the
amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the
Mergers, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the Company
Stockholders in the Mergers. No limitations were imposed by the Transaction Committee upon Barclays with
respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:
reviewed and analyzed the Merger Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2023, and the specific terms of
the Mergers;
reviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning the Company that Barclays believed
to be relevant to its analysis, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31,
2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022;
reviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations
and prospects of the Company furnished to Barclays by the Company, including financial projections
of the Company prepared by management of the Company;
reviewed and analyzed a trading history of the Company’s Class A Common Stock from October 5,
2020 to February 28, 2023 and a comparison of that trading history with those of other companies that
Barclays deemed relevant;
74 • 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition
of the Company with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
had discussions with management of the Company concerning its business, operations, assets,
liabilities, financial condition and prospects; and
has undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information used by Barclays without any independent verification of such information
(and had not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information).
Barclays also relied upon the assurances of management of the Company that they were not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the
financial projections of the Company, upon the advice of the Company, Barclays assumed that such
projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of management of the Company as to the Company’s future financial performance and that the
Company would perform substantially in accordance with such projections. In arriving at its opinion,
Barclays assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such projections or estimates or the
assumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not conduct a physical
inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and did not make or obtain any evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company. In addition, Barclays was not authorized by the
Transaction Committee to solicit, and did not solicit, any indications of interest from any third party with
respect to the purchase of all or a part of the Company’s business. Barclays’ opinion was necessarily based
upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its
opinion. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on events or
circumstances that may have occurred after the date of its opinion.
Barclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger
Agreement and all the agreements related thereto. Barclays also assumed, upon the advice of the Company,
that all material governmental, regulatory and third-party approvals, consents and releases for the Mergers
would be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the Mergers will
be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. Barclays did not express any opinion as to
any tax or other consequences that might result from the Mergers, nor did Barclays’ opinion address any
legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood the Company had obtained
such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other
analyses as summarized below. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values
to the shares of Class A Common Stock but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock
(other than the executive officers of the Company and the Excluded Stockholders) in the Mergers to such
holders on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial and comparative analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances.
Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor
considered by it but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in the context of the
circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all
analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its
opinion.
Summary of Material Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion
to the Transaction Committee. The summary of Barclays’ analyses and reviews provided below is not a
75 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
complete description of the analyses and reviews underlying Barclays’ opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of analysis and review and the application of those methods to particular circumstances, and,
therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description.
For the purposes of its analyses and reviews, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many
of which are beyond the control of the Company or any other parties to the Mergers. No company, business
or transaction considered in Barclays’ analyses and reviews is identical to the Company, OpCo, Parent,
Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the Mergers, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews
is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments
concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public
trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions considered in Barclays’ analyses and
reviews. None of the Company, OpCo, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, Barclays or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates
contained in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
or review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of
companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the
companies, businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results
derived from, Barclays’ analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The summary of the financial analyses and reviews summarized below includes information presented in
tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses and reviews used by Barclays, the tables
must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without
considering the full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Barclays’ analyses and
reviews.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
In order to estimate the present value of the Class A Common Stock, Barclays performed a discounted
cash flow analysis of the Company. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology
used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of
the asset. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by
discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic
assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate
factors.
To calculate the estimated enterprise value (“EV”) of the Company using the discounted cash flow
method, Barclays added the Company’s projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2023
through 2032 based on the December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts to the “terminal value” of the
Company as of the end of fiscal year 2032, and discounted such amount to its present value using a mid-year
convention and a range of selected discount rates. The after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated
by taking earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and subtracting cash taxes and
capital expenditures. The residual value of the Company at the end of the forecast period, or “terminal
value,” was estimated by selecting a range of perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%, which were
derived by Barclays using its professional judgment and experience. The range of after-tax discount rates of
8.0% to 8.5% was selected based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company and
the selected comparable companies. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Class A
Common Stock by subtracting actual net debt as of December 31, 2022 from the estimated EV using the
discounted cash flow method and dividing such amount by the fully diluted number of shares of Company
Capital Stock, as of February 28, 2023, based on information provided by management of the Company
(excluding the impact of potential dividends elected to be paid in stock to holders of shares of Series A
Founder Preferred Stock). The following summarizes the result of these calculations:

Selected Comparable Company Analysis
In order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to
provide a range of relative implied equity values per share of Class A Common Stock by reference to those

Barclays calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios of the Company and the
selected comparable companies. As part of its selected comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated
and analyzed (a) each tower company’s ratio of EV to (i) its 2022 actual or estimated (“2022A/E”) and 2023
estimated (“2023E”) tower cash flows (“TCF”) and (ii) its 2022A/E and 2023E earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization and adjusted for non-recurring items (“EBITDA”), (b) each data center
company’s ratio of EV to its 2022A/E and 2023E EBITDA and (c) each triple-net lease REIT’s implied
capitalization rate, defined as the ratio of next twelve months’ (“NTM”) net operating income to EV. The EV
of each company was obtained by adding its short- and long-term debt to the sum of the market value of its
common equity, the value of any preferred stock (at liquidation value) and the book value of any minority
interest, finance leases, asset retirement obligations and subtracting its cash and cash equivalents, as
applicable and based on the relevant financial reporting standards. All of these calculations were performed,
and based on publicly available financial data (including FactSet, Green Street, SNL and Bloomberg) and
closing prices, as of February 28, 2023, the last trading date prior to the delivery of Barclays’ oral opinion.

Barclays selected the comparable companies listed above because of similarities in one or more
business or operating characteristics with the Company. However, because of the inherent differences
between the business, operations and prospects of the Company and those of the selected comparable
companies, Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the selected comparable company analysis. Accordingly, Barclays also made
qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics
and prospects of the Company and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading
values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.
These qualitative judgments

related primarily to the differing industries, geographies, sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels and
degree of operational risk between the Company and the companies included in the selected company
analysis. Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected a range of 15.5x to 17.5x multiples of EV to 2023E
ground cash flows (“GCF”) for the Company and applied such range to the December 31, 2023 - 2032
Management Forecasts to calculate a range of implied prices per share of Class A Common Stock. The
following summarizes the result of these calculations:

Barclays noted that on the basis of the selected comparable company analysis, the Merger
Consideration was within the range of implied values per share of Class A Common Stock calculated using
the December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts.
Other Factors
Barclays also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial
analyses in connection with rendering its advice, but were references for informational purposes, including,
among other things, the illustrative present value of future share price analysis, equity research price targets
analysis and historical share price analysis described below.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Barclays performed an analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of
Class A Common Stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of the theoretical
future value of a company’s equity as a function of such company’s financial projections and valuation
multiples. Barclays first calculated the implied future EV of the Company for fiscal years ending December 31,
2023 through December 31, 2030 by applying ratios of multiples of the Company’s EV to NTM GCF ranging
from 15.5x to 17.5x to NTM GCF estimates for the Company as reflected in the December 31, 2023 - 2032
Management Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2030. The illustrative EV to NTM GCF
multiple estimates were derived by Barclays utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into
account the results from the selected comparable companies analysis and the EV to NTM GCF multiples for
the Company as of February 28, 2023. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Class A
Common Stock based on the fully diluted number of shares of Company Capital Stock as of February 28,
2023, as provided by management of the Company (including the dilutive effect of potential stock dividends
to holders of shares of Series A Founder Preferred Stock and corresponding distributions with respect to the
Series A Rollover Profits Units).
Utilizing a range of discount rates of 12.4% to 13.3% based on an analysis of the cost of equity of the
Company, Barclays then derived a range of implied present values per share for Class A Common Stock by
discounting to present value the implied future values per share of Class A Common Stock. The following
table presents the results of the analysis of the implied present value of the illustrative future value per share
of Class A Common Stock.

The illustrative present value of future share price analysis for the Company was used for informational
purposes only and was not included in Barclays’ financial analyses.
Equity Research Price Targets Analysis
Barclays reviewed publicly available one-year forward price targets for the Class A Common Stock
prepared and published by equity research firms that covered the Company as of February 28, 2023. Barclays
noted that the range of low to high one-year forward share price targets as of February 28, 2023 was $13.00 to
$18.00 per share. Barclays also reviewed publicly available one-year forward price targets for the Class A
Common Stock prepared and published by equity research firms that covered the Company as of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
February 28, 2023, by deriving in each case, the implied equity value based on the number of shares
outstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2022 mentioned in the applicable equity research firm report,
then adjusted based on the fully diluted number of shares of Company Capital Stock as of February 28, 2023,
as provided by management of the Company. Barclays noted that the range of low to high one-year forward
share price targets as of February 28, 2023, as so adjusted, was $11.46 to $16.94 per share. The price targets
published by the equity research firms did not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for shares of
Class A Common Stock and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial
performance of the Company and future market conditions. The equity research price targets analysis for the
Company was used for informational purposes only and was not included in Barclays’ financial analyses.
Historical Share Price Analysis
To illustrate the trend in the historical trading prices of shares of Class A Common Stock, Barclays
considered historical data with regard to the trading prices of Class A Common Stock for the period from
February 28, 2022 to February 28, 2023. Barclays noted that during the period from February 28, 2022 to
February 28, 2023, the closing price of the Class A Common Stock ranged from $7.97 to $16.52. The historical
share price analysis for the Company was used for informational purposes only and was not included in
Barclays’ financial analyses.
General
Barclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking
activities, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate,
corporate and other purposes. The Transaction Committee selected Barclays because of its qualifications,
reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions generally, as well as substantial experience in transactions comparable to the Mergers.
Barclays is acting as financial advisor to the Transaction Committee in connection with the Mergers. As
compensation for its services in connection with the Mergers, the Company paid Barclays a fee of $2,500,000
upon the delivery of Barclays’ opinion, which is referred to as the “Opinion Fee”. The Opinion Fee was not
contingent upon the conclusion of Barclays’ opinion or the consummation of the Mergers. The Company
may pay Barclays an additional discretionary fee of up to $1,000,000 based upon the Transaction
Committee’s assessment of Barclays’ work in connection with its engagement. In addition, the Company has
agreed to reimburse Barclays for a portion of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with the Mergers and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement by the
Transaction Committee and the rendering of Barclays’ opinion. Barclays has performed various investment
banking services for the Company in the past, and expects to perform such services in the future, and has
received, and expects to receive, customary fees for such services. In the past two years, Barclays has not
earned material investment banking fees from the Company. Further, Barclays and its affiliates in the past
have provided, currently are providing, or in the future may provide, investment banking services to the
Excluded Stockholders and have received or in the future may receive customary fees for rendering such
services. In the past two years, Barclays has not earned investment banking fees from the Excluded
Stockholders. In addition, Barclays and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, or in
the future may provide, investment banking services to EQT and PSP, and certain of their respective affiliates
and portfolio companies and have received or in the future may receive customary fees for rendering such
services, including (i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to EQT, PSP and certain of their respective
portfolio companies and affiliates in connection with certain mergers and acquisition transactions; (ii) having
acted or acting as arranger, bookrunnner and/or lender for EQT, PSP and certain of their respective portfolio
companies and affiliates in connection with the financing for various acquisition transactions; and (iii)
having acted or acting as underwriter, initial purchaser and placement agent for various equity and debt
offerings undertaking by EQT, PSP and certain of their respective portfolio companies and affiliates. During
the period from January 1, 2021 through March 1, 2023, Barclays and its affiliates received aggregate fees for
such services of approximately $80 million from EQT and its portfolio companies

Other than providing an annual outlook with respect to Acquisition Capex (as defined below), including
the annual outlook with respect to Acquisition Capex included in the Company’s press release, dated March
1, 2023, which was attached as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, furnished to the
SEC on March 2, 2023, the Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal
projections as to future performance, or results of operations, earnings or other results, due to, among other
things, the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. In August 2022, in connection with
the strategic review process, senior management of the Company provided the Company Board and the
Transaction Committee, as well as Citi, Goldman Sachs and Barclays, with certain non-public, unaudited
prospective financial information for the years ending June 30, 2022 through 2032 (the “June 30, 2022 - 2032
Management Forecasts”). In February 2023, senior management of the Company updated the June 30, 2022 - 
2032 Management Forecasts based on the Company’s actual performance through the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 and senior management’s best then currently available estimates and assumptions with
respect to the future financial performance of the Company on a standalone basis (such updated forecasts,
the “December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts” and, together with the June 30, 2022 Management
Forecasts, the “Management Forecasts”). Senior management of the Company provided the December 31,
2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts to the Company Board and the Transaction Committee, in connection
with their respective evaluations of the proposed transaction, and to Citi, Goldman Sachs and Barclays, in
connection with each firm’s respective financial analysis and fairness opinion summarized in the sections of
this proxy statement titled “- Opinion of Citi”, “- Opinion of Goldman Sachs” and “- Opinion of Barclays”.
The Company is including a summary of the Management Forecasts to provide Company Stockholders with
access to information that was made available to the Company Board and the Transaction Committee, as well
as each of Citi, Goldman Sachs and Barclays, as described above.
The Company Board and the Transaction Committee reviewed the Management Forecasts and,
following discussions with Company management, the Company Board authorized and instructed Citi and
Goldman Sachs, and the Transaction Committee authorized and instructed Barclays, to use and rely upon the
December 31, 2023 - 2032 Management Forecasts for purposes of their respective financial analyses and
fairness opinions summarized in the sections of this proxy statement titled “- Opinion of Citi”, “- Opinion of
Goldman Sachs” and “- Opinion of Barclays”. Citi, Goldman Sachs and Barclays were not authorized to, and
did not use, the June 30, 2022 - 2032 Management Forecasts for purposes of their respective financial
analyses and fairness opinions summarized in the sections of this proxy statement titled “- Opinion of Citi”,
“- Opinion of Goldman Sachs” and “- Opinion of Barclays”. Senior company management modeled each of
the Management Forecasts based on its best then currently available estimates and assumptions with
respect to the future financial performance of the Company on a standalone basis. The Management
Forecasts were based upon certain financial, operating and commercial assumptions developed solely using
the information available to management of the Company at the time the Management Forecasts were
created.

“Annualized in-place rents” is calculated using the implied monthly revenue from all revenue producing
leases that are expected to be collected on leases owned and acquired (“in-place”) as of the
measurement date multiplied by twelve. Implied monthly revenue for each lease is calculated based on
the most recent rental payment under such lease. Annualized in-place rents is a non-GAAP financial
measure and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue as a measure of operating
performance.
“Ground cash flow” measures gross profit, which is calculated as revenue minus cost of service.
“Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated using “EBITDA”, which is defined as net income (loss) before net
interest expense, income tax expenses (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, and further adjusting
for non-cash impairment - decommissions expense, realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign
currency debt, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses associated with non-debt
transactions and balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, share-based
compensation expense and transaction-related costs recorded in selling, general and administrative
expense incurred for incremental business acquisition pursuits (successful and unsuccessful) and
related financing and integration activities. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and
should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as a measure of operating
performance or cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.
“Acquisition Capex” represent the total cash spent and committed to be spent for the Company’s
acquisition of revenue-producing assets during the period measured. Acquisition Capex is a non-GAAP
financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to capital expenditures as a measure of
cash flows or as measure of liquidity.
“Unlevered free cash flow” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less share-based compensation, less cash
taxes and less Acquisition Capex. Unlevered free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should
not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as a measure of operating
performance or cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. In addition to the projections of unlevered free
cash flow set forth above, senior management of the Company provided to the Company Board and the
Transaction Committee, as well as Citi, Goldman Sachs and Barclays a terminal year unlevered free cash
flow of $389 million, which was derived from terminal year annualized-in-place rent of $522 million,
ground cash flow of $483 million, adjusted EBITDA of $481 million and property right renewal capital
expenditures of $4 million and assuming no asset acquisitions and no origination activity and costs in
the terminal year.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Important Information Concerning the Management Forecasts
The Management Forecasts were prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and were
provided to the Company Board and the Transaction Committee and to Citi, Goldman Sachs and Barclays as
described above. The summary of the Management Forecasts is included in this proxy statement solely to
give Company Stockholders access to certain financial forecasts that were made available to the Company
Board, the Transaction Committee, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Barclays and is not being included in this proxy
statement to influence a Company Stockholder’s decision whether to vote for the Merger Agreement
Proposal or for any other purpose.
The Management Forecasts were generated solely for internal use and not developed with a view
toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data,
published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking statements or GAAP, but, in the view of Company
management, were reasonably prepared in good faith on a basis reflecting the best available estimates and
judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the time of preparation. No independent registered
public accounting firm provided any assistance in preparing the Management Forecasts. Accordingly, no
independent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or otherwise performed any
procedures with respect to the Management Forecasts or expressed any opinion or given any other form of
assurance with respect thereto, and they assume no responsibility for the information contained in the
Management Forecasts. The KPMG LLP report included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 relates solely to the historical financial information of the Company
and to an assessment of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. Such reports do not extend
to the Management Forecasts and should not be read to do so.
The inclusion of the Management Forecasts should not be regarded as an indication that the Company,
Parent, their affiliates, officers, directors, advisors (including financial advisors) or any of their respective
representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Management
Forecasts to be necessarily predictive of future results. There can be no assurance that the projected results
will be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower or higher than estimated, whether or not the
Mergers are completed. None of the Company, Parent or their respective affiliates, officers, directors,
advisors (including financial advisors) or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results
will not differ from the Management Forecasts, and, except as required by applicable law, none of the
Company, Parent or their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or
reconcile, the Management Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Management
Forecasts were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the
assumptions underlying the Management Forecasts are shown to be inappropriate. None of the Company or
its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors (including financial advisors) or other representatives has made or
makes any representation to any Company Stockholder or other person regarding the information included in
the Management Forecasts or the Company’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in
the Management Forecasts or that forecasted results will be achieved. The Company has made no
representation to Parent, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Management Forecasts. The
Management Forecasts are forward-looking statements. The assumptions and estimates underlying the
Management Forecasts, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the
Company, may not be realized. None of the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors (including
financial advisors) or other representatives assumes any responsibility to holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock or equity interests in OpCo for the accuracy of this information. In particular, the Management
Forecasts, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily, were based on numerous variables and
assumptions that are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business,
economic, competitive and regulatory risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in the Management Forecasts. Because the Management Forecasts cover
multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are
unlikely to anticipate each circumstance that will have an effect on the Company’s results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows. Important factors that may affect actual results and result in the
Management Forecasts not being achieved include, but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties
described in the section of this proxy statement titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements”, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside the control of the Company
and, upon consummation of
83 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
the Mergers, will be beyond the control of EQT or PSP and the Surviving Entities. Company Stockholders are
urged to review the Company’s SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to the Company’s
business. The Management Forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change.
Some or all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Management Forecasts may have changed
since the date the Management Forecasts were prepared. The information set forth in the Management
Forecasts is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The
Management Forecasts were developed on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Mergers, and
therefore the Management Forecasts do not give effect to the Mergers or any changes to the Company’s
operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Mergers. Furthermore, the
Management Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Mergers to be completed and
should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Management Forecasts contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that Company management
believes are helpful in understanding the Company’s past financial performance and future results. Company
management regularly uses a variety of financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for
comparing the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis. The non-GAAP financial measures
are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. While the
Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the overall understanding of its
underlying operating performance trends compared to historical and prospective periods and its peers and
that these measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding
financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows as well as insight into the compliance with its debt covenants, there are limitations associated with the
use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in
accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company’s competitors and may not be directly
comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company’s competitors due to potential differences in the
exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP
financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a
board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business combination such as the
Mergers if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations
of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Company Board, the Transaction Committee or
their respective financial advisors in connection with their respective evaluations of the Mergers or their
respective financial analyses and fairness opinions, as applicable. Accordingly, the Company has not
provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Management Forecasts to the
relevant GAAP financial measures.
The Management Forecasts summarized in this section were prepared prior to the execution of the
Merger Agreement and have not been updated to reflect any changes after the date they were prepared. T

COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND, AND UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION, TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE
THE MANAGEMENT FORECASTS TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING SINCE THEIR PREPARATION
OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE PROJECTIONS ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE. In light of the foregoing
factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Forecasts, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on the Management Forecasts.",91,94

The Company’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the Mergers that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company Stockholders generally. The members of the
Company Board and the Transaction Committee were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the
determination to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and recommend that the Company Stockholders
approve the Merger Agreement Proposal.
The Company’s executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are William H. Berkman (Co-
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), Scott G. Bruce (President), Richard I. Goldstein (Chief
84 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Operating Officer), Glenn J. Breisinger (Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer) and Jay L. Birnbaum (Senior
Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary).
Treatment of Company Equity Awards
For information regarding beneficial ownership of shares of Company Common Stock by each of the
Company’s directors and executive officers and all of such directors and executive officers as a group, please
see the section titled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management”, beginning on
page 131. Each of the Company’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to receive, for each (i) share
of Company Capital Stock, (ii) OpCo Class B Common Unit, (iii) LTIP Unit and (iv) Series B Rollover Profits
Unit he or she holds that is entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, the same per share Merger
Consideration in the same manner as other Company Stockholders.
As described further in the section titled “The Merger Agreement - Treatment of Company Equity
Awards” beginning on page 104, as of the Company Merger Effective Time or OpCo Merger Effective Time,
as applicable, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the applicable award holder, including pursuant to
any Rollover Agreement: (a) each LTIP Unit that is outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement will
vest (to the extent unvested), and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (with all
applicable performance conditions deemed satisfied and based on the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock into which such LTIP Unit is convertible immediately prior to the OpCo Merger Effective Time); (b)
each share of Company Restricted Stock held by an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that
is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be canceled
and converted into an RS Payment Right; provided that, if the employment of a holder of an RS Payment
Right is terminated following the Company Merger Effective Time but prior to the applicable vesting date by
Parent without Cause (as defined in the Company Stock Plan) or due to death or Disability (as defined in the
Company Stock Plan), then the vesting and payment of such RS Payment Right will be accelerated to the first
payroll date after the date of such termination; and (c) each share of Company Restricted Stock held by a
non-employee director of the Company Board as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, will vest (to the extent unvested) and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum
cash payment, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration.
The following table sets forth the value of the LTIP Units and all shares of Company Restricted Stock
held by the Company’s executive officers as of May 9, 2023, the latest practicable date to determine such
amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, assuming that: (a) all LTIP Units that are equitized and
have value (i.e., the holder’s capital account maintained for U.S. federal income tax purposes exceeds the
applicable predetermined threshold) and shares of Company Restricted Stock are valued based on the
Merger Consideration (in the case of LTIP Units, based on the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
into which such LTIP Unit is convertible immediately prior to the OpCo Merger Effective Time); (b) all LTIP
Units subject to performance criteria have such criteria deemed satisfied; (c) all LTIP Units granted in 2023
are not equitized and therefore have no value (i.e., the holder’s capital account maintained for U.S. federal
income tax purposes does not exceed the applicable predetermined threshold) and are exchanged for no
consideration as of the Closing; (d) the Closing occurs on September 30, 2023, which is the assumed Closing
Date only for purposes of this compensation-related disclosure; and (e) the individuals included in the table
below do not receive any Company equity awards or forfeit any Company equity awards prior to September
30, 2023; however, such values do reflect the expected vesting of LTIP Units and shares of Company
Restricted Stock prior to such date. As of May 9, 2023, no director holds unvested Company equity awards.

Severance Entitlements
Each executive officer (other than Mr. Birnbaum) is party to an individual employment agreement with
the Company and OpCo, dated February 10, 2020 (the “Existing Employment Agreements”). Mr. Birnbaum is
party to an amended and restated individual employment agreement with the Company and OpCo, dated
April 17, 2024 (the “Birnbaum Employment Agreement” and, collectively with the Existing Employment
Agreements, the “Executive Officer Agreements”). The Existing Employment Agreements provide for
severance payments and other benefits in the event of a “qualifying termination”, which includes a
termination of employment by the Company in anticipation of a change in control of the Company or a
termination by the Company other than for “Cause”, death or “Disability” or by the executive for “Good
Reason”  (in each case, as defined in the Existing Employment Agreements) within one year following a
change in control of the Company. The Mergers will constitute a change in control of the Company for
purposes of the Existing Employment Agreements.
In the event of a qualifying termination in anticipation of or within one year following a change in
control of the Company, each executive officer party to an Existing Employment Agreement will be entitled to
receive, in addition to certain accrued amounts: (a) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of two
times the sum of the executive officer’s base salary and annual bonus earned in respect of the fiscal year
immediately prior to the termination date; (b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination based on
target performance; (c) any earned but unpaid bonus for the year prior to the year of termination; (d) a cash
payment equal to 24 months of COBRA premiums (regardless of whether the executive officer elects COBRA
continuation coverage); and (e) accelerated vesting of all outstanding Company equity awards. Receipt of
the above-described payments and benefits is conditioned upon the executive officer executing (and not
revoking) a release of claims in favor of the Company.
The Birnbaum Employment Agreement reflects the terms of Mr. Birnbaum’s voluntary resignation as
Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary and transition into the role of special advisor on
September 1, 2023 (the “Transition Date”), without regard to whether the Merger occurs. If Mr. Birnbaum
continues in employment until the Transition Date, or if Mr. Birnbaum’s employment is terminated by the
Company without “Cause” or by Mr. Birnbaum for “Good Reason”  (each, as defined in the Birnbaum
Employment Agreement) or due to death or disability prior to the Transition Date, he will generally be
entitled to receive the payments described above in the Existing Employment Agreements (other than, in the
case of his continued employment until the Transition Date, accelerated vesting of long-term incentive
compensation awarded in 2023), as well as continued payment of base salary and advisor fees (as
applicable). If Mr. Birnbaum’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Birnbaum
for Good Reason during the two-year period following the Transition date (the “Special Advisor Period”), he
would generally be entitled to continued advisor fees, benefits continuation through the end of the Special
Advisor Period and accelerated vesting of long-term incentive compensation awarded in 2023. None of the
payments or benefits provided for in the Birnbaum Employment Agreement are in any way conditioned upon
the Merger (or any other change in control transaction). Mr. Birnbaum is required to execute a release of
claims in favor of the Company on the Transition Date and upon his termination of employment as special
advisor.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Executive Officer Agreements provide that, in the event part or all of the compensation, payments
or benefits payable in connection with the respective executive officer’s separation with the Company would
constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, then the payments will be
reduced to the largest amount which would result in no portion of the payments being subject to the excise
tax if such reduction will provide the executive officer with the best net after-tax result.
The severance payments and benefits described above are generally subject to the applicable executive
officer’s compliance with restrictive covenants consisting of one-year (two-year, in the case of Messrs.
Berkman and Birnbaum) post-termination restrictions on competing with the Company and soliciting the
Company’s employees or customers, non-disclosure of the Company’s confidential information at any time,
intellectual property assignment and a mutual non-disparagement.
Treatment of Annual Bonuses
The Merger Agreement provides that each participant, including our executive officers, in a Company
Benefit Plan (as defined below) that is an annual cash incentive plan will receive a (a) Pre-Closing Bonus (as
defined below) based on projected full-year actual performance, pro-rated based on the portion of the plan
year elapsed prior to the Closing and (b) Post-Closing Bonus (as defined below) based on full-year target
performance, pro-rated based on the remaining duration of the performance period. Payment of the annual
cash bonus in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs is generally contingent on the
employee’s continued employment through the payment date; provided, however, that in the event of the
employee’s termination of employment without Cause (as defined in the Company Stock Plan) between the
Closing and the end of the performance period, such employee would receive an amount equal to (i) the Pre-
Closing Bonus and (ii) a portion of the Post-Closing Bonus, pro-rated based on the number of days such
employee was employed between the Closing and the end of the performance period.
Retention and Transaction Bonuses
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may establish a cash-based retention bonus
program and a cash-based transaction bonus program, in both cases for the benefit of certain employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries. As of the date of this proxy statement, no director or executive officer has
been allocated awards under these programs.
Arrangements with EQT, PSP and Parent
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, each of Messrs. Berkman, Bruce, Goldstein
and Breisinger entered into a new employment agreement with Chord TopCo, LP, to be effective upon the
Company Merger Effective Time (the “New Employment Agreements”). Upon the Company Merger Effective
Time, Chord TopCo, LP will assign the New Employment Agreements to the Company and such New
Employment Agreements will replace and supersede the applicable Existing Employment Agreement for each
such executive officer. The New Employment Agreements have an initial term of five years, subject to earlier
termination as provided in the New Employment Agreements, with automatic one-year extensions and
provide for (among other things): (a) an annual base salary of $571,000 for Mr. Berkman; $798,000 for each of
Messrs. Bruce and Goldstein; and $654,000 for Mr. Breisinger; (b) eligibility to receive a cash bonus with a
target of 50% (100%, in the case of Mr. Berkman) of base salary; and (c) eligibility to participate in and
receive equity grants or other incentive awards under the equity incentive plan of Chord TopCo, LP or one of
its affiliates to be established in connection with or following the Closing. In the event of a qualifying
termination (which is generally defined to be the same as in the Existing Employment Agreements), each such
executive officer would generally be entitled to the same severance payments and benefits (other than
accelerated vesting of equity) as described above in the section titled “- Severance Entitlements”, and, other
than in connection with a qualifying termination in anticipation of or within one year following a change in
control, such severance payments and benefits (other than any prior year’s bonus) are subject to cessation
and recoupment, as applicable, if the executive officer breaches the post-termination restrictions on
competing with the Company, soliciting the Company’s employees or customers, or disclosing the
Company’s confidential information, in any case, in a way that would reasonably be expected to result in
significant reputational or monetary harm to the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
It is possible that other members of management will enter into individual agreements with Parent and/or
one or more of its subsidiaries regarding employment following the Closing; however, no such discussions
are ongoing as of the time of this proxy statement.
Rollover Agreements
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Mr. Berkman entered into a Rollover
Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub II and each of Messrs. Bruce, Goldstein and Breisinger entered into a
Rollover Agreement with Merger Sub II, in each case, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, such parties agreed to roll over a portion of their existing equity
interests in OpCo into equity interests in the Surviving LLC. Please see the section of this proxy statement
titled “- Rollover Agreements”.
Management Equity Program
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, EQT and PSP agreed to a term sheet with
certain executive officers setting forth the material terms of a management equity program to provide equity
incentives to certain members of management and other service providers of the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries following the Closing. The program will consist of an equity pool of approximately 9.5% of
the outstanding equity of Chord TopCo, LP (or OpCo) as of the Closing (on a fully diluted basis), from which
certain employees, including the executive officers, will be eligible to receive profits interest units, which will
be subject to vesting conditions and certain call rights of Chord TopCo, LP (or OpCo). As a condition of any
grant of the profits interest units under the management equity program, executive officers who entered into
a New Employment Agreement would be subject to the restrictive covenants therein. As of the date of this
proxy statement, no director or executive officer has been allocated awards under the management equity
program.
EQT and PSP further agreed to adopt a cash-based long-term incentive plan to be utilized after the
Closing for employees (which could, in the discretion of the board of Chord TopCo, LP, include the executive
officers), under terms and conditions to be agreed by the board of Chord TopCo, LP and Mr. Berkman. As of
the date of this proxy statement, no director or executive officer has been allocated awards under this plan.
Tax Protection Agreement
On March 1, 2023, Mr. Berkman, EQT and PSP agreed that, upon the Closing, subject to and in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, Mr. Berkman will, and Parent will cause the Company TPA Parties to,
enter into the TPA, pursuant to which the Company TPA Parties will indemnify Mr. Berkman and certain of
his affiliated entities for any current taxes resulting from certain non-ordinary course actions that are taken
by the Company TPA Parties. In the event that the Company TPA Parties take such actions, they will be
liable for grossed-up tax amounts associated with the income or gain recognized by Mr. Berkman or such of
his affiliated entities as a result of such actions. The Company TPA Parties’ liability under the TPA is capped
at (i) $32 million in the aggregate within the first 20 years of the Closing Date and (ii) $22.5 million in the
aggregate after the twentieth anniversary of the Closing Date; however, in certain limited circumstances, the
cap will be increased to $40 million. As of the date of this proxy statement, no amounts have been paid to Mr.
Berkman or any of his affiliated entities under the terms of the TPA.
Section 280G Mitigation Actions
Each of our executive officers is subject to a 280G best-net cutback, as described above in the section
titled “- Severance Entitlements”. The Company is permitted to take certain actions before the Company
Merger Effective Time to mitigate the amount of potential “parachute payments” for “disqualified
individuals”  (each, as defined in Section 280G of the Code), including accelerating the vesting or payment of
compensation that would have been scheduled to vest or be paid in the future into a year prior to the year in
which the Closing is expected to occur, accelerating the vesting or payment of compensation that would vest
or become payable on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement or the
Company Benefit Plan into a year prior to the year in which the Closing is expected to occur, entering into or
expanding non-competition agreements or paying out accrued vacation. As of the date of this proxy

TABLE OF CONTENTS
statement, the Company has not approved any specific actions to mitigate the expected impact of Section
280G of the Code on the Company and any disqualified individuals.
Director and Officer Indemnification
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Company Board and executive officers
of the Company will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policies following the Closing. For a more detailed description of the provisions
of the Merger Agreement relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy
statement titled “The Merger Agreement - Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 122.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company’s
named executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are payable in connection with or
otherwise relates to the Mergers. The Company Stockholders are being asked to approve, on a nonbinding,
advisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will
not be binding on either the Company, the Company Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement
Proposal is approved by the Company Stockholders and the Mergers are consummated, the compensation
will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above under the
section titled “- Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers”.
The potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation
S-K. The estimated values are based on (a) an assumption that the Mergers are consummated on September
30, 2023, (b) the per share Merger Consideration of $15.00, (c) the named executive officers’ salary and target
bonus amounts as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, (d) the number of LTIP Units and shares of
Company Restricted Stock held by the named executive officers as of May 9, 2023, the latest practicable date
to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, less any awards expected to vest in the
ordinary course prior to September 30, 2023, and assuming no additional grants or forfeitures of Company
equity awards prior to September 30, 2023 and (e) an assumption that each named executive officer
experiences a termination of employment immediately following the consummation of the Mergers under
circumstances that entitle such named executive officer to receive severance (i.e., a termination other than
for “Cause”, death or “Disability” or resignation for “Good Reason” or, for Mr. Birnbaum only, a termination
other than for “Cause” or resignation for “Good Reason”). As such, the amounts indicated below are
estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions
described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before
consummation of the Mergers. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive
officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
The amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of
a 280G best-net cutback, to which all named executive officers are subject; therefore, actual payments to the
named executive officers may be less than the amounts indicated below. In addition, the amounts shown
below do not attempt to reflect any implication from any individual’s Rollover Agreement with Parent and/or
Merger Sub II or any amounts that Mr. Berkman may be owed under the TPA, nor do such amounts reflect
the payments such individuals may receive in respect of the Company Capital Stock, OpCo Class B Common
Units or Series B Rollover Profits Units that such individuals may hold.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of the cash severance each named
executive officer is eligible to receive upon a qualifying termination or, in the case of Mr. Birnbaum,
upon a termination without Cause or for Good Reason immediately following consummation of the
Mergers (as described in the section titled “- Severance Entitlements”). The value of cash severance for
each named executive officer other than Mr. Birnbaum consists of: (a) two times the sum of the
executive officer’s base salary and annual bonus earned in respect of the fiscal year immediately prior to
the termination date, (b) a pro-rata annual bonus for the year of termination based on target
performance, assuming a termination date of September 30, 2023 and (c) a cash payment equal to 24
months of COBRA premiums (regardless of whether the executive officer elects COBRA continuation
coverage). The value of cash severance for Mr. Birnbaum includes continued payment of his special
advisor fees through the end of the Special Advisor Period. As of the date of this proxy statement, all
bonuses for the year prior to the assumed year of termination have been paid and are not included. Each
named executive officer’s cash severance payments are “double-trigger”, as such payments will not be
payable solely as a result of the occurrence of the Company Merger Effective Time and will only be
payable in the event of a qualifying termination, or, in the case of Mr. Birnbaum, upon a termination
without Cause or for Good Reason, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions described in the
section titled “- Severance Entitlements”. The amounts in this column are included in the sub-table

The amounts shown in this column represent the estimated aggregate value of the named executive
officers’ vested and unvested LTIP Units and shares of Company Restricted Stock as of September 30,
2023, as shown in the table above in the section titled “- Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger - Treatment of Company Equity Awards”. As described in such section
at the OpCo Merger Effective Time or Company Merger Effective Time, as applicable, except as
otherwise agreed by Parent and the applicable award holder, including pursuant to any Rollover
Agreement, (i) each LTIP Unit (whether vested or unvested) will vest with all applicable performance
conditions deemed satisfied and be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment, without
interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock into which such LTIP Unit is convertible immediately prior to the OpCo Merger Effective Time and
(ii) each share of Company Restricted Stock held by an employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective
Time will be canceled and converted into an RS Payment Right; provided that, if the employment of a
holder of an RS Payment Right is terminated following the Company Merger Effective Time but prior to
the applicable vesting date by Parent without Cause (as defined in the Company Stock Plan) or due to
death or Disability (as defined in the Company Stock Plan), then the vesting and payment of such RS
Payment Right will be accelerated to the first payroll date after the date of such termination. Given LTIP
Units granted in 2023 will not be equitized as of immediately prior to the OpCo Merger Effective Time,
they are assumed for purposes of this table to be canceled in exchange for no consideration as of the
Closing. However, to the extent any such LTIP Units are rolled over in connection with the Closing, as
described in the section titled “- Rollover Agreements”, they may appreciate after the Closing. As of the
date of this proxy statement, all LTIP Units held by named executive officers were granted prior to the
date of the Merger Agreement and no LTIP Units are assumed to have been granted following the date
of the Merger Agreement, and therefore the amounts shown in this column in respect of LTIP Units are
“single-trigger”, as such payments would be payable on the OpCo Merger Effective Time regardless of
whether or not the executive’s employment is terminated, absent entrance into a Rollover Agreement or
other individual agreement between the named executive officer and Parent

Company to investigate purported breaches of fiduciary duty, director independence and disinterestedness
and/or other corporate wrongdoing in connection with the Mergers and related transaction documents. On
April 14, 2023, the Company responded to this demand letter by denying the allegations contained therein
and objecting to such purported stockholder's scope of requests but indicating a proper inspection of books
and records would be permitted, subject to negotiation of an appropriate scope of production and execution
of a standard confidentiality agreement.
Between April 7, 2023 and May 1, 2023, three complaints were filed in connection with the Mergers. On
April 7, 2023, a complaint, captioned Ryan O’Dell v. Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. et al., 23-cv-2956
(S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported
holder of shares of Class A Common Stock; on April 12, 2023, a complaint, captioned Elaine Wang v. Radius
Global Infrastructure, Inc. et al., 23-cv-3068 (S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York by a purported holder of shares of Class A Common Stock; and on May 1,
2023, a complaint, captioned Shannon Jenkins v. Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. et al., 23-cv-3657
(S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported
holder of shares of Class A Common Stock; all three cases named as defendants the Company and members
of the Company Board. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants caused to be filed
with the SEC a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement relating to the Mergers in
violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. Among
other remedies, the complaints seek: an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Mergers
unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted
from the preliminary proxy statement; rescinding the Merger Agreement or any of the terms thereof to the
extent already implemented or granting rescissory damages; awarding the plaintiffs the costs and
disbursements of their actions, including reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses; and granting
such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The Company has not yet formally
responded to these complaints, but believes that the allegations contained therein are without merit.
On April 17, 2023, the Company received two demand letters from purported holders of shares of Class
A Common Stock and, on April 19, 2023, the Company received a third demand letter from a purported holder
of shares of Class A Common Stock; all three letters alleged disclosure deficiencies in the preliminary proxy
statement and demanded issuance of corrective disclosures. The Company has not yet formally responded
to these demand letters, but believes that the allegations contained therein are without merit.
As of May 9, 2023, the Company was not aware of the filing of other lawsuits or the submission of other
demand letters challenging the Mergers and/or alleging deficiencies with respect to the preliminary proxy
statement; however, such lawsuits or demand letters may be filed or submitted, respectively, in the future.

Appraisal Rights
If the Mergers are consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Capital Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL and, if all
procedures described in Section 262 of the DGCL are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for
the fair value of their shares of Company Capital Stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Mergers, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together
with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of your
shares of Company Capital Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less
than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger
Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL will not receive the Merger
Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an
amount determined to be the “fair value” of their shares of Company Capital Stock following petition to, and an
appraisal by, the Delaware Court of Chancery. Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair
value of their shares of Company Capital Stock determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the
same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to comply
strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of
appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, persons
wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors before attempting to
exercise such rights.
A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following
publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following
summary is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to Section 262 of the DGCL and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement.
Any person who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the
DGCL and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such
rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a
recommendation that persons seek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to
comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of a
person’s appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.
A holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Company Capital Stock who (a) continuously holds
such shares through the Company Merger Effective Time, (b) has not consented to or otherwise voted in
favor of the Mergers or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (c) strictly complies with the
procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL, (d) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for
appraisal of such shares and (e) in the case of a beneficial owner, a person who (i) reasonably identifies in
his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (ii) provides
documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such
documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (iii) provides an address at
which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the
Chancery List (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company
Capital Stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Mergers, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value.
Section 262 of the DGCL requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a
meeting of stockholders, the stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than
twenty (20) days before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section
262 of the DGCL or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which
Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes the
Company’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Mergers, in
compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Company Capital Stock, you must satisfy each of the
following conditions: you must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of
Company Capital Stock before the taking of the vote on the Mergers, which demand must reasonably inform
us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of Company Capital Stock for which appraisal is
demanded and, for beneficial owners only, such demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of
such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and
correct copy of what it purports to be and must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents
to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List; you must not vote or
submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; you must hold your shares of
Company Capital Stock continuously through the Company Merger Effective Time; and you must comply
with the other applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL.
A Company Stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail his, her or its written demand
for appraisal to the following address:

A record holder who holds shares of Company Capital Stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker,
fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or
less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the record owner. In such case, the
demand must set forth the number of shares of Company Capital Stock covered by such demand. Where the
number of shares of Company Capital Stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all
shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding in the name of such record owner.
Within ten (10) days after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give
written notice that the Mergers have become effective to each of (a) the Company Stockholders who has
properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and (b) the beneficial owners who has demanded appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Company Merger Effective Time, any person who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and
accept the Merger Consideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person’s shares of Company
Capital Stock by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Company Merger Effective Time, but not thereafter, the
Surviving Corporation and any person who has properly and timely demanded appraisal and otherwise
complied with Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed
by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of Company Capital Stock held by all
persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should
assume that the Company and the Surviving Corporation will not file such a petition or initiate any
negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of Company Capital Stock. Accordingly, persons who
desire to have their shares of Company Capital Stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for
the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of
the DGCL. If, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Company Merger Effective Time, no
95 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously
demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.
In addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Company Merger Effective Time, any person
who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled,
upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate
number of shares of Company Capital Stock not voted in favor of the Mergers and with respect to which
demands for appraisal were received by the Surviving Corporation and the aggregate number of holders of
such shares. Such statement must be given within ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been
received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for the
delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.
Upon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the
Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such
service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of Company
Capital Stock and with whom the Surviving Corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such
shares (the “Chancery List”). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to
the Surviving Corporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will determine which persons have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and have
become entitled to appraisal rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the
persons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Company Capital Stock and who hold shares
represented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of Company Capital Stock to the Register in
Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any person fails to
comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
If immediately before the Company Merger Effective Time, the shares of the class or series of Company
Capital Stock as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of such shares of
Company Capital Stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2)
the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceedings, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the
Chancery List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through such proceedings the Delaware Court of Chancery shall determine the fair value of
shares of Company Capital Stock taking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Mergers, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion,
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound
quarterly from the Company Merger Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%)
over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the
period between the Company Merger Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time
before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each person entitled
to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only on the sum of (1)
the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of Company Capital Stock
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the
Surviving Corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.
96 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
When the fair value of the shares of Company Capital Stock is determined, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to
receive the same.
Although the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to
the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and persons
should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the
same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, the Surviving Corporation does not anticipate offering more
than the Merger Consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in
any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of the relevant
shares of Company Capital Stock is less than the Merger Consideration.
In determining “fair value”, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making
this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of
the date of the Mergers which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of
the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Mergers.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme
Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of
value”, but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment
or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that
“elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as
of the date of the Mergers and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” In addition, the Delaware
courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may
not be a dissenting person’s exclusive remedy.
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed
upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs
do not include attorneys’ and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys’
and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List
who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Company Capital
Stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award
pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware
Court of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Any person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not be
entitled to vote for any purpose any shares of Company Capital Stock subject to such demand or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to
the holder of record at a date prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any person without
the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as
the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any
application to the Delaware Court of Chancery made under Section 262(j) of the DGCL; provided, however,
that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding
or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept
the terms offered upon the Mergers within sixty (60) days after the Company Merger Effective Time. If no
petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within one hundred twenty (120) days
after the Company Merger Effective Time, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously
demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.

The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of
Company Common Stock with respect to the disposition of Company Common Stock in exchange for cash
pursuant to the Company Merger. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Company Merger and does not
address consequences to holders of Founder Preferred Stock, Company equity awards or interests in OpCo
(including Rollover Equity). This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, all of which are
subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect
the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein. The Internal Revenue Service may not agree
with the tax consequences described in this discussion.
This discussion assumes that holders of Company Common Stock hold their shares as capital assets
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion
does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Company
Common Stock in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, nor does it discuss the special
considerations applicable to holders of Company Common Stock subject to special treatment under the U.S.
federal income tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds,
partnerships or other pass-through entities and their partners or members, regulated investment companies,
real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations, retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance
companies, dealers in securities or non-U.S. currencies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market
method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, U.S.
expatriates, holders who acquired their shares of Company Common Stock through the exercise of stock
options or otherwise as compensation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders who exercise
their appraisal rights in connection with the Company Merger, holders who hold their shares of Company
Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as
defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, accrual method holders who prepare an
“applicable financial statement”  (as defined in Section 451 of the Code) and holders who own or have owned
(directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Company Common Stock (by vote or value)
outstanding. In addition, this discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of
any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction or U.S. federal non-income tax consequences (e.g., the U.S. federal
estate or gift tax or the application of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the
Code).
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Company
Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the
partner and activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding Company Common
Stock, you should consult your own tax advisor.
All holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including
the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange
for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Company Common
Stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;
a trust if (1) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States
and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have
98 •

• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect
under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; or
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity or arrangement treated
as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of Company Common Stock that is not a U.S. holder.
Tax Consequences of the Company Merger for Holders of Company Common Stock
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash pursuant to the Company Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Company Merger and
such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company Common Stock converted into cash pursuant
to the Company Merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the Company
Merger. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally
eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or at different prices,
such U.S. holder must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to
each block of common stock.
A U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup
withholding (at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the Company Merger, unless
such holder properly establishes an exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise
complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited
against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the
required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.
Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the Company Merger by a non-U.S. holder
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the
case of an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which
case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S.
holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, such corporation may be subject to
branch profits tax at the rate of 30% on the effectively connected gain (or such lower rate as may be
specified by an applicable income tax treaty);
the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more in the taxable year of the Company Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case
the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable income tax
treaty rate) on any gain derived from the disposition of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Company Merger (other than gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business), which may be
offset by U.S. source capital losses; or
shares of Company Common Stock constitute a United States real property interest because the
Company is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the Company
Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held shares of Company Common Stock (the “relevant
period”).
99 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The Company believes that it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC during the relevant period.
Even if the Company is or was a USRPHC during the relevant period, gain arising from a non-U.S. holder’s
receipt of cash in exchange for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax if the Company Common Stock is “regularly traded”, as defined in applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. holder owned, actually and
constructively, 5% or less of the Company Common Stock throughout the relevant period.
A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, in certain circumstances, backup
withholding will apply with respect to the cash received by such holder pursuant to the Company Merger,
unless such non-U.S. holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor
does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person as defined
under the Code) or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided that such
non-U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

General
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed (subject to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement) to use its reasonable best efforts to, among other things, cooperate in all reasonable
respects with each other in connection with obtaining all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers,
permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any governmental authority or third party
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In
addition, Parent has agreed to take all actions necessary to (a) secure the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under any applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws and obtain all consents
under any antitrust and foreign investment laws that may be required by any governmental antitrust and
foreign investment authority with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (b) promptly resolve objections as may be asserted
by any governmental antitrust and foreign investment authority or other person with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any antitrust and foreign investment laws that may be asserted by any governmental antitrust and
foreign investment authority, in each case subject to certain limitations. For a detailed description of
regulatory matters, please see below under the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger
Agreement - Efforts to Consummate the Mergers”.
The approvals required under the Merger Agreement include the receipt of the regulatory approvals as
described below.
We currently expect to complete the Mergers in the third quarter of 2023. However, we cannot predict
the exact timing of completion of the Mergers because we cannot guarantee when all of the necessary
regulatory approvals will be obtained, or if they will be obtained at all.
Regulatory Approvals
The Mergers are subject to receipt of consents, approvals or other clearances under (a) the antitrust
laws of the European Union, China and Chile (and if Parent determines in accordance with terms set forth
100 TABLE OF CONTENTS
in the confidential disclosure schedules that approval is required, Turkey and Israel), (b) the foreign
investment laws of Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom and (c) the
foreign investment laws of each of Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, solely in
the event any such jurisdiction enacts a new (or expands an existing) mandatory and/or suspensory pre-
closing foreign investment law applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
following the date of the Merger Agreement. As of May [11], 2023, the parties submitted filings with the
applicable governmental authorities under (i) the antitrust laws of Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Romania,
Spain and the United Kingdom and (ii) under the foreign investment laws of China, Chile[, the European
Union] and the United Kingdom. Clearance was received from such governmental authorities under (A) the
antitrust laws of Germany on April 28, 2023 and Spain on May 3, 2023 and (B) the foreign investment laws of
the United Kingdom on April 6, 2023.
In each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory
laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties
or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual
rights. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Mergers will not be made or that, if a challenge is made,
we will prevail.
Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Mergers will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will
prevail.
The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

the failure to take the actions set forth in the following clauses (x) and (y) would be inconsistent with its

Company or its affiliates that has not previously been furnished or made available to Parent and its
representatives, the Company shall at the same time, or substantially concurrently, furnish such information
to Parent.
Following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Merger Agreement requires the Company to:
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt by the Company or any of its representatives)

Takeover Proposal or other inquiry (and a copy of such Takeover Proposal or other inquiry, if in
writing, including any draft agreements or term sheets, financing commitments and other documents
submitted therewith) and (ii) the identity of the person or group of persons making such Takeover
Proposal or other inquiry;
keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects on a current basis of the status and any
developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal or other inquiry, offer or proposal
(including any material changes thereto); and
provide Parent with a copy of any written documents delivered to the Company or its subsidiaries or
representatives that contain any material amendments thereto or any material change to the material
terms or conditions thereof, including notifying Parent in writing if the Company determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal in
accordance with the Merger Agreement.
The Company has also agreed not to, and not to cause its subsidiaries to, enter into any confidentiality
agreement or other contract that prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with the Merger Agreement or otherwise prevents the Company, its subsidiaries or their
respective representatives from complying with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means any
confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and after the date of the Merger Agreement that
contains provisions that are not materially less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
confidentiality agreements entered into with EQT and PSP, as amended, except that such confidentiality

agreement need not restrict the making of, or amendment or modification to, any confidential Takeover
Proposal to the Company Board.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Takeover Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any person or group of persons (other than Parent and its affiliates) relating to:
any direct or indirect acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of 20% or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company (including any direct or indirect acquisition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, of equity interests in any subsidiary of the
Company) and its subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by
the Company Board);
any direct or indirect acquisition, purchase or issuances, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, of 20% or more of the aggregate outstanding Company Capital Stock or 20% or more of
the aggregate outstanding equity interests in any subsidiary of the Company;
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group of
persons beneficially owning 20% or more of the aggregate Company Capital Stock or 20% or more of
the aggregate outstanding equity interests in any subsidiary of the Company; or
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries
pursuant to which such person or group of persons (or the stockholders of any person) would
acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company (including any
direct or indirect acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of equity
interests in any subsidiary of the Company) and its subsidiaries (based on the fair market value
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Company Board) or 20% or more of the aggregate equity
securities of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity, in each case, other than
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board has determined in its good-faith judgment, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) would, if consummated, be more favorable to the
Company Stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement from a financial point
of view, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including the legal, financial
(including financing terms), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal and the identity of the
person making the proposal) and the Merger Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to the
terms of the Merger Agreement), and (ii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, taking
into account all legal, financial (including financing terms), regulatory, timing and other aspects of such
proposal; provided that, for purposes of the definition of “Superior Proposal”, the references to “20%” in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.",122,124

Company Board may, and may cause the Company to, (x) make a customary “stop, look and listen”

with respect to a Takeover Proposal until the close of business on the tenth business day after the
commencement of such Takeover Proposal pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act) (any of

or arrangement related to any Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (each, a “Company Acquisition Agreement”).
However, prior to the Special Meeting, the Company Board may (i) authorize and make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a
breach of the Merger Agreement or an Intervening Event (as defined below) if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law or (ii)
authorize and cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a bona fide written
Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement and terminate the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (a) the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law and (b) such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board shall not, and shall cause the
Company not to, take any action set forth in clause (i) or (ii) (other than the authorization thereof subject to
compliance with this proviso) unless (A) the Company has given Parent at least four business days’ prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material terms of any such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the person or group of persons making such Superior Proposal) (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to any financial term or other materials terms or
conditions (including the provision of financing) of any Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a
new notice period (which shall be two business days instead of four business days)), (B) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its subsidiaries and representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent
during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a
binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (C) following the end of such notice
period, the Company Board has considered in good faith such binding offer, and after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, determined that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law and in the case of any action pursuant to clause (i) with
respect to a Takeover Proposal or action pursuant to clause (ii), after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, the Takeover Proposal subject to such notice continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such binding offer by Parent were to be given effect;
provided, further, that any purported termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with clause (ii) to
this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect unless the termination is in accordance with the
Merger Agreement and the Company pays or causes to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee (as
defined below) in accordance with the Merger Agreement prior to or concurrently with such termination. See
the section of this proxy statement titled “- Termination Fees - Termination Fee Payable by Parent”.
Nothing in the Merger Agreement prohibits the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that is required by applicable law if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company
Board, to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable law; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company Board,

that was not known to the Company Board prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (or if known, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which event or circumstance, or any
material consequence thereof, becomes known to the Company Board prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval; provided, that in no event shall the fact alone that the Company meets or exceeds any
internal or published forecasts or projections for any period, or any changes alone after the date of the
Merger Agreement in the market price or trading volume of shares of the Company, constitute, or be taken

any and all actions necessary to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted by any governmental antitrust
and foreign investment authority or other person with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust and foreign

transactions to occur no later than the End Date (as defined below), including (each, a “Remedial Action”):
agreeing to sell or otherwise disposing of, holding (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise), or divesting all or any portion of the business, assets or operations of Parent, the

one or more agreements requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing with
respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any action that limits the Company’s or
its subsidiaries’ or affiliates’ freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to retain
or hold, directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of

take any action, or fail to take any action, if the Company has knowledge that the taking of such
action, or the failure to take such action, shall cause a default, potential default or event of default or
any equivalent term (each as defined in the applicable specified debt agreement) to occur under any
such specified debt agreement (each, a “Debt Default”), except as consented to by Parent in writing
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries
are permitted to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things determined
by the Company in good faith in consultation with Parent to be necessary, proper or advisable in order to
cure, or to obtain a waiver of, any Debt Default (or any potential Debt Default), including (i) the payment,
repayment, redemption or discharge of all principal, interest, premiums and fees owing by the Company or its
subsidiaries to the holders of the applicable specified debt outstanding under the applicable specified debt
agreement or (ii) such other actions or things that cause the holders of such specified debt under such
specified debt agreement, or the agent on their behalf, to no longer have the right to cause, on account of
such Debt Default, the specified debt outstanding thereunder to be due and payable prior to its scheduled
final maturity; provided, however, that it is hereby understood and agreed that if any Restricted Remedy (as
defined below) was effected to cure, or to obtain a waiver of, such Debt Default, then such Debt Default shall
cease to be continuing for purposes of the Merger Agreement only if Parent shall have consented in writing
to such Restricted Remedy; provided, further, the parties understand and have agreed that any Debt Default
shall not be continuing for purposes of the Merger Agreement if cured or, in accordance with the applicable
specific debt agreement, waived by the applicable parties thereto in accordance with the Merger Agreement,
in each case, without the consummation of any Restricted Remedy.
The Company has agreed to provide prompt notice to Parent in the event the Company or any of its
subsidiaries obtains knowledge, and Parent has agreed to provide prompt notice to counsel for the Company
in the event any deal professionals of the Sponsors actively involved with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement obtain actual knowledge, that any Debt Default shall have occurred and is continuing
(or, in the case of any such notice by Parent, that any event or circumstance that, had the Company had
knowledge thereof, would constitute a Debt Default shall have occurred or shall exist).
For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Restricted Remedy” means any of the following under any
specified debt agreement:

premiums or other amounts in order to obtain their waiver of any Debt Default or (3) any
modification to the rate of interest on, or to any premiums or fees (or similar amounts) payable to
the holders thereof in respect of, any specified debt, including the addition of any premiums or fees
(or similar amounts) not set forth in the applicable specified debt agreements as in effect on the

understood that (x) any payment, repayment, prepayment, redemption or other discharge of any
amounts that are required to be paid, repaid, prepaid, redeemed or otherwise discharged by the

of any specified debt (including by adding scheduled payments of principal of any specified debt

would be, at the time of determination, in effect in the absence of any such modification or (4)
unless such modification is permitted under clause (i) above, modifies, in a manner that is adverse

Parent has obtained equity financing commitments for an aggregate amount of $1,798,600,000 for
purposes of financing the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Sponsors have

The Merger Agreement provides that for a period of one year following the Company Merger Effective
Time (or until an earlier termination of employment), Parent will provide each employee of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (each, a “Continuing
Employee”) with (i) a base salary or wages (as applicable) and target annual cash incentive opportunities
that are no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (ii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those that would have been provided to
such Continuing Employee under the applicable severance plans and arrangements disclosed to Parent and
(iii) employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than the annual cash bonus opportunities referred to in
clause (i) above and any long-term incentive, equity-based, change in control, retention or similar non-
recurring compensation and benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
Parent will honor, in accordance with their terms, all the Company Benefit Plans as in effect at the
Company Merger Effective Time. Parent has acknowledged in the Merger Agreement that the Mergers will
constitute a “change in control” or “change of control”  (or term of similar import) for purposes of the
Company Benefit Plans.
The Merger Agreement provides that each participant in a Company Benefit Plan that is an annual cash
incentive plan will receive a cash bonus in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, based on:
(i) for the portion of the year in which the Closing occurs that elapses prior to Closing, projected full-year
actual performance, pro-rated based on the portion of the plan year elapsed prior to the Closing (the “Pre-
Closing Bonus”) and (ii) for the remainder of the year, full-year target performance, pro-rated based on the
remaining duration of the performance period (the “Post-Closing Bonus”). Payment of the annual cash bonus
in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs is generally contingent on the Continuing
Employee’s continued employment through the payment date, provided, however, that in the event of a
termination without Cause (as defined in the Company Stock Plan) between the Closing and the end of the
performance period, such Continuing Employee would receive an amount equal to (x) the Pre-Closing Bonus
and (y) a portion of the Post-Closing Bonus, pro-rated based on the number of days such Continuing
Employee was employed between the Closing and the end of the performance period.

material breach of the Merger Agreement, the Company will reimburse all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II in connection with the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereunder and for which an invoice has been delivered to the Company up to an
aggregate maximum of $7,500,000 (the “Expense Reimbursement”), which amount will be credited against the
Company Termination Fee.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, a termination fee becomes payable,
the party obligated to make such payment fails to timely pay such termination fee and the other party
commences an action and obtains a judgment against the paying party for the payment of such termination
fee, then the paying party will pay the other party’s reasonable and documented costs and expenses in
connection with such action, together with interest on such amount, in accordance with the Merger
Agreement.

If the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and a termination fee is paid under
the circumstances for which such fee is payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement, payment of the
applicable termination fee, subject to the reimbursement and indemnification obligations described above,
will be the sole and exclusive monetary damages remedy available to the payee in respect of any and all
losses incurred as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be
consummated and, upon payment of such applicable termination fee in such circumstances, none of the

The parties agreed that irreparable damage for which monetary relief (including any termination fee that
becomes payable in accordance with the Merger Agreement), even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of the Merger Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties fail to take any action
required of them under the Merger Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
Subject to certain limitations, the parties also acknowledged and agreed that (i) the parties are entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the Merger
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof without proof of damages or
otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the Merger Agreement,
(ii) the provisions described under “- Termination Fees”  (A) are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of the Merger Agreement and (B) are not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to specific enforcement and (iii)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger Transactions and without that right, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into the Merger Agreement. Additionally, the parties agreed not
to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable, and
not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties further acknowledged and agreed that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, the parties have agreed that the
right of the Company to seek or obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and to effect the Closing (but not the right of the Company to seek such
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason prior to termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms) are subject to the following requirements: (A) the No
Restraints Condition and the Antitrust and Foreign Investment Approvals Condition have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which are,
at the time the written notice referred to in clause (B) below is delivered by the Company, capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such written notice); (B) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed by written notice to Parent that the Company Stockholder Approval Condition has been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which
are, at the time such written notice is delivered by the Company, capable of being satisfied if the Closing
Date were the date of such written notice) and that it is ready, willing and able to consummate such closing;
and (C) Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II have failed to close the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement on or prior to the date that is the later of (1) the first date upon which such closing is
required to occur under the Merger Agreement, and (2) the date that is five business days following the
delivery of the notice referred to in clause (B) above.
Extension of the End Date
If, prior to the End Date, any party brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement by any other party or the Company brings any action seeking
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the equity commitment letters,
the End Date will be automatically extended (i) for the period during which such action is pending, plus 20
business days or (ii) by such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c)
under the Exchange Act, we are asking Company Stockholders to approve, by advisory (nonbinding) vote,
the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers. As required by those rules, the Company is asking Company Stockholders to
vote on the approval of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to the Company’s
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, as disclosed in the table entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - 
Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers”, including the associated narrative discussion, and the
agreements, arrangements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may be paid or
become payable, are hereby APPROVED.”
The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the consummation of the Mergers is a
vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. Accordingly, Company
Stockholders may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve such
compensation and vice versa. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on the
Company or the Board; as the Company is contractually obligated to pay such compensation, such
compensation will be paid or become payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the
Mergers are consummated and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.
The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Advisory Compensation Proposal.

"Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc._20230505_DEFM14A_20858042_4661091.Pdf",PROPOSAL 3: THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL,"PROPOSAL 3: THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL
We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if
necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the Adjournment Proposal). If Company Stockholders approve
the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special
Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from Company
Stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against the Merger Agreement
Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had
received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Agreement Proposal such that
the Merger Agreement Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on
the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to
votes in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting
if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
Company Capital Stock properly cast for and against the Adjournment Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will
have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the
outcome of the Adjournment Proposal and (c) broker “non-votes”  (if any) will have no effect on the outcome
of the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal. Shares of Company Capital Stock represented by properly executed,
timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If
a Company Stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy
card, the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes
of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as
recommended by the Company Board.
The Company does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Agreement
Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.
The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

The following table sets forth information relating to the beneficial ownership of our voting stock as of
May 9, 2023, by:
each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of any
class of our outstanding shares of voting stock;
each of our directors;
each of our NEOs; and
all of our directors and executive officers as a group.
The number of shares beneficially owned by each entity, person, director or executive officer is
determined in accordance with SEC rules, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial
ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares over which the
individual has sole or shared voting power or investment power as well as any shares that the individual has
the right to acquire within 60 days of May 9, 2023 through the exercise of any stock option or other rights.
Except as otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property laws, the persons named in the
table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of stock held by that person.
The percentage of shares beneficially owned is computed as of May 9, 2023 on the basis of (a)
[99,664,040] shares of our Class A Common Stock outstanding, (b) [10,255,811] shares of our Class B
Common Stock outstanding, (c) 1,600,000 shares of our Series A Founder Preferred Stock outstanding and (d)
1,386,033 shares of our Series B Founder Preferred Stock outstanding. Shares of our stock that a person has
the right to acquire within 60 days of May 9, 2023 are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the
percentage ownership of the person holding such rights, but not for purposes of computing the percentage
ownership of any other person, except with respect to the percentage ownership of all directors and
executive officers as a group. In addition, beneficial ownership of shares of our Class A Common Stock
below does not reflect any impact of a redemption by a holder of OpCo Class B Common Units, LTIP Units or
Series B Rollover Profits Units, as the Company retains the right to determine whether to redeem such units
for cash or shares of Class A Common Stock. Except as set forth below, the address for each beneficial owner
listed is c/o Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc., 3 Bala Plaza East, Suite 502, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania

Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Radius Class A Common Stock”), of
Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. (“Radius”) of the Merger Consideration (defined below) to be received by
such holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) proposed to be entered into among Radius, APW OpCo LLC (“OpCo”),
Chord Parent, Inc. (“Parent”), Chord Merger Sub I, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub
I”) and Chord Merger Sub II, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub I (“Merger Sub II”). As more
fully described in the Merger Agreement, (a) (i) Merger Sub I will be merged with and into Radius and (ii)
Merger Sub II will be merged with and into OpCo (the “Mergers”) and (b) each outstanding share of the
Radius Class A Common Stock, other than (i) Appraisal Shares and (ii) Owned Company Common Stock
(each as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $15.00, in cash (the
“Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Mergers are more fully set forth in the Merger
Agreement.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft, dated March 1, 2023, of the Merger Agreement and held
discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of Radius
concerning the business, operations and prospects of Radius. We examined certain publicly available
business and financial information relating to Radius as well as certain financial forecasts and other
information and data relating to Radius which were provided to or discussed with us by the management of
Radius. We reviewed the financial terms of the Mergers as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to,
among other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Radius Class A Common
Stock; the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Radius; and the capitalization and
financial condition of Radius. In connection with our engagement and at the direction of Radius, we were
requested to approach, and we held discussions with, third parties to solicit indications of interest in the
possible acquisition of Radius. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and
examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and market criteria as we
deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized by our
fairness opinion committee.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the
accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to
or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and upon the assurances of the management of Radius that
they are not aware of any relevant information that has been omitted or that remains undisclosed to us. With
respect to financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Radius provided to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with us, we have been advised by the management of Radius, and we have
assumed, with your consent, that such financial forecasts and other information and data were reasonably
prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Radius as to, and are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate, the future financial
performance of Radius and the other matters covered thereby. We express no view or opinion as to any
financial forecasts and other information or data (or underlying assumptions on which any such financial
forecasts and other information or data are based) provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with
us.

We have assumed, with your consent, that the Mergers will be consummated in accordance with the
terms, conditions and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the Mergers, no delay,
limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Radius or the
Mergers or that otherwise would be meaningful to our opinion or analysis. Representatives of Radius have
advised us, and we further have assumed, with your consent, that the final terms of the Merger Agreement
will not vary materially from those set forth in the draft reviewed by us. We have not made or been provided
with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-
balance sheet or otherwise) of Radius or any other entity nor have we made any physical inspection of the
properties or assets of Radius or any other entity. We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of
Radius or any other entity under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. We also are not expressing any view or opinion as to the prices at which the Radius Class A
Common Stock or any other securities will trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including following
the announcement of the Mergers. We are not expressing any view or opinion with respect to accounting,
tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, as to tax or other consequences of the
Mergers or otherwise or changes in, or the impact of, accounting standards or tax and other laws, regulations
and governmental and legislative policies affecting Radius or the Mergers (including the contemplated
benefits thereof), and we have relied, with your consent, upon the assessments of representatives of Radius
as to such matters.
Our opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date hereof, of the
Merger Consideration to be received by holders of shares of Radius Class A Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, without regard to individual circumstances of holders of the Radius Class A Common
Stock that may distinguish such holders or the securities of Radius held by such holders, and does not
address any other terms, aspects or implications of the Mergers, including, without limitation, the form or
structure of the Mergers, the OpCo Merger and the Rollover Agreement (each as defined in the Merger
Agreement) and any consideration payable in connection therewith, the allocation of the aggregate
consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement among the holders of, or the treatment or
cancellation for no consideration of, the various types of shares of capital stock of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or any terms, aspects or implications of any agreement, arrangement or understanding to be
entered into or amended or modified in connection with or contemplated by the Mergers, or the amount
thereof relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. We express no view as to, and our opinion does
not address, the underlying business decision of Radius to effect or enter into the Mergers, the relative
merits of the Mergers as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for Radius or the
effect of any other transaction in which Radius might engage or consider. We also express no view as to, and
our opinion does not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other
aspect of any compensation or other consideration to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to
the Mergers, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Our opinion is
necessarily based upon information available to us, and financial, stock market and other conditions and
circumstances existing and disclosed to us, as of the date hereof. Although subsequent developments may
affect our opinion, we have no obligation to update, revise or reaffirm our opinion. As you are aware, the
credit, financial and stock markets, the industries in which Radius operates and the securities of Radius have
experienced and may continue to experience volatility and we express no view or opinion as to any potential
effects of such volatility on Radius or the Mergers (including the contemplated benefits thereof).

Mergers and will receive a fee for such services, of which a portion is payable upon delivery of this opinion

As you are aware, although we and our affiliates have not provided investment banking, commercial banking
or other similar financial services to Radius and/or its affiliates unrelated to the proposed Mergers during the
past two years for which we and our affiliates received compensation, we and our affiliates in the future may
provide such services to Radius and/or its affiliates, for which services we and our affiliates would expect to
receive compensation. As you also are aware, we and our affiliates in the past have provided, and currently
are providing, investment banking, commercial banking and other similar financial services to EQT AB (publ)

Commitment Letter (each as defined in the Merger Agreement), and its affiliates and controlled portfolio

companies of EQT, as bookrunner or arranger in connection with certain bond issuances, loans and credit
facilities of controlled portfolio companies of EQT, as ratings advisor to a controlled portfolio company of

including, without limitation, during the two year period prior to the date hereof, having acted as joint lead
arranger and bookrunner in connection with certain bond offerings and as lender in connection with certain
loans of PSP and its affiliates. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade
or hold the securities of Radius for our own account or for the account of our customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, we and our affiliates (including
Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with Radius and its affiliates.
Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information of the Board of
Directors of Radius (in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the proposed Merger, and our opinion is not
intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder
should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed Mergers or otherwise.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as investment bankers, our work as described
above and other factors we deemed relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Radius Class A Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,

invested with Centerbridge, EQT and/or PSP and their affiliates from time to time and may have invested in
limited partnership units of affiliates of Centerbridge, EQT and/or PSP from time to time and may do so in the

We further note that concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into
capped call transactions with respect to the Convertible Notes (collectively, the “Capped Call Transactions”)
with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and three other counterparties, each acting as principal for its own account.
The Capped Call Transactions consisted of the purchase by the Company of capped call options with
respect to, collectively, approximately 11,693,201 Class A Shares, the aggregate number of Class A Shares
underlying the Convertible Notes (with 40% purchased from Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC). The Capped Call
Transactions may be adjusted, exercised, cancelled and/or terminated in accordance with their terms in
connection with certain events, including the announcement or consummation of the Transaction, which
could result in a payment from Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to the Company. In particular, under the terms of
the Capped Call Transactions, each of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and the other counterparties, each acting
separately as calculation agent under the Capped Call Transactions to which it is a party, is entitled in certain
circumstances to make adjustments to the cap price of the embedded call options sold by the Company to
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and the other counterparties to reflect the economic effect of the announcement
of the Transaction on the Capped Call Transactions. In its capacity as calculation agent, all actions or
exercises of judgment by Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC pursuant to the terms of the Capped Call Transactions
to which it is a party must be performed in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports
to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the two years ended December 31,
2021; the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-4, including the prospectus contained therein dated
October 5, 2020 relating, among other things, to the issuance of the Class A Shares; certain interim reports to
stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the
Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved
for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior
management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations,
financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for
the Class A Shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar
information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial
terms of certain recent business combinations in the technology, media and telecommunications industry;
and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed
appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the
accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information
provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company.We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.
We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the
Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be
consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or
condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be
available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates)
of Class A Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $15.00 in cash per Class A Share to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other
term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument

the allocation of the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to the Agreement among the holders of, or
the cancellation for no consideration of, the various types of shares of capital stock of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, the OpCo Merger and the Rollover Agreement (each as defined in the Agreement) and any
consideration payable in connection therewith, and the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration
received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities (including the Series A
Founder Preferred Stock, the OpCo Common Units and the Rollover Equity (as such terms are defined in the
Agreement)), creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or
nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $15.00 in
cash per Class A Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Class A Shares
pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the
Class A Shares will trade at any time or, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and
stock markets on the Company, Parent or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the
solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their
respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we
assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances,
developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed
herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of Class A Shares should vote or act with respect to such Transaction
or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $15.00 in cash
per Class A Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Class A Shares pursuant to
the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

otherwise hold their properties, rights and assets and (ii) conduct their business as it is now being

reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other Representatives to, (i) on the date hereof (the “No-
Shop Period Start Date”), immediately (A) cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions,

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.02(a), if at any time on or after the No-Shop
Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company receives a
bona fide written Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this
Section 5.02 by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives, (ii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal

Company Board. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02 by any
Representative of the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.02 by the Company.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry, offer, proposal, request for information or discussion that would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Takeover Proposal, and such notice shall disclose to Parent a summary of the material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or other inquiry (and a copy of such Takeover Proposal or
other inquiry, if in writing, including any draft agreements or term sheets, financing commitments and
other documents submitted therewith) and the identity of the person or group of persons making such
Takeover Proposal or other inquiry and (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects on a
current basis of the status and any developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal or other

tender or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of
such tender offer or exchange offer (it being understood that the Company Board may, and may cause
the Company to, (x) make a customary “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, and (y) elect to take no position with respect to a Takeover Proposal until the
close of business on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of such Takeover Proposal
pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act (any action described in this clause (i), other than the

Change”), or (ii) adopt, authorize or declare advisable or publicly propose to adopt, authorize or declare
advisable or authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, joint venture agreement, license agreement, alliance agreement or other similar
agreement or arrangement related to any Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (each, a “Company Acquisition Agreement”). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, the Company
Board may (1) authorize and make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.02 or an Intervening Event
if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law or (2) authorize and cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.02 and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii) if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (I) the failure to
take such action
A-35 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (II) such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board shall not, and
shall cause the Company not to, take any action set forth in clause (1) or (2) (other than the
authorization thereof subject to compliance with this proviso) unless (A) the Company has given Parent
at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice
shall specify the material terms of any such Superior Proposal and the identity of the person or group of
persons making such Superior Proposal) (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any
financial term or other materials terms or conditions (including the provision of financing) of any
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new notice period (which shall be two (2) Business
Days instead of four (4) Business Days)), (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to
the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (C) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board has
considered in good faith such binding offer, and after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
determined that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and in the case of any action pursuant to clause (1) with respect to a Takeover
Proposal or action pursuant to clause (2), after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, the Takeover Proposal subject to such notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if
the revisions proposed in such binding offer by Parent were to be given effect; provided, further, that
any purported termination of this Agreement in accordance with clause (2) to this sentence shall be void
and of no force and effect unless the termination is in accordance with Section 7.01(d)(ii) and the
Company pays or causes to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section
7.03 prior to or concurrently with such termination. Subject to this Section 5.02 (including Section
5.02(d)), the parties hereby agree that the Company Board may only withhold or withdraw (or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent) the Company Board Recommendation through properly adopted
resolutions of the Company Board.
(e) Nothing in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by
applicable Law if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Company Board, to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the
directors’ exercise of their duties to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Company Board, the Transaction Committee or any duly authorized
committee of the Company Board take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section
5.02(d). Any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section 5.02(d).
(f) As used in this Agreement, the term “Takeover Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person or group of persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to (i) any direct or
indirect acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company (including any direct or indirect acquisition, in a single transaction
or series of related transactions, of equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company) and its
Subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Company
Board), (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition, purchase or issuances, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, of 20% or more of the aggregate outstanding Company Capital Stock or 20% or
more of the aggregate outstanding equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company, (iii) any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group of persons beneficially
owning 20% or more of the aggregate Company Capital Stock or 20% or more of the aggregate
outstanding equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or (iv) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which such person or group
of persons (or the stockholders of any person) would acquire, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company (including any direct or indirect acquisition, in a single transaction
or series of related transactions, of equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company) and its

a third party (including any Governmental Authority) that could otherwise prevent or impede, interfere

Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, enter into one or more agreements
requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing with respect to any

Subsidiaries’ or Affiliates’ freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to
retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any equity interest in any joint
venture held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (each, a “Divestiture Action”);
provided, however, that the consummation of the transactions and other actions provided for in any
such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction of all of
the conditions to the Closing in a case where the Closing will occur immediately following such
Divestiture Action (and where Parent has irrevocably committed to effect the Closing immediately
following such Divestiture Action). In no event shall the Company propose, negotiate, effect or agree to
any Remedial Action or Divestiture Action without the prior written consent of the Parent Parties.

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Company Merger Effective
Time is, or at any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time was, a director or officer of the
Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an “Indemnitee”) with respect to all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising
out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the Company or
such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee’s capacity as a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director or
officer or fiduciary of another person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause
(A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Company Merger Effective Time (including any Action relating
in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent the Company would have
been permitted to do so under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time as provided in the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws and the Organizational Documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on
the date hereof or in any agreement in existence as of the date hereof providing for indemnification
between the Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of
incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date hereof in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.06 (including in
A-40 TABLE OF CONTENTS
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 5.06) as
incurred to the fullest extent the Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law;
provided that, the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it shall be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this
Section 5.06(a).
(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any threatened or actual Action relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
Section 5.06 (each, a “Claim”) for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee
from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall
cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.
(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries covering
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time with respect to those
individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time become) covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies;
provided that, (i) if any Claim (whether arising before, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time) is
brought against an Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Company Merger
Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.06 shall continue in effect until the full and final
resolution of such Claim and (ii) if the aggregate annual premium for such insurance exceeds 300% of
the current annual premium for such insurance, then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a
policy for the applicable individuals with the greatest coverage as is then available at a cost up to but
not exceeding 300% of such current aggregate annual premium. The Company shall purchase, prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” policy on terms and conditions
providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, covering without limitation
the Mergers and the other Transactions; provided that, (x) Parent shall have the right to approve the
proposed policy prior to purchase, and (y) in no event shall the aggregate annual premium for such
insurance exceed 300% of the current annual premium for such insurance. If such prepaid “tail” policy
has been obtained by the Company prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further
obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section 5.06(c).
(d) The provisions of this Section 5.06 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual
may have under the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws, by Contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.06 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.06
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnitee has consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.06 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.06).
(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties, rights and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall

other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section

(a) During the period commencing at the Company Merger Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the date on which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs (or until an earlier
termination of employment), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or in the
case of a transfer of all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its
successors and assigns) to provide, each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (each, a “Company Employee”)
with (i) a base salary or wages (as applicable) and target annual cash incentive opportunities that are no
less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (ii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those that would have been
provided to such Company Employee under the applicable severance benefit plans, programs, policies,
agreements and arrangements set forth in Section 5.08(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (iii)
employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than (x) annual cash bonus opportunities referred to in
clause (i) above and (y) any long-term incentive, equity-based, change in control, retention or similar
non-recurring compensation and benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) honor in accordance with their terms all the Company Benefit Plans, as in effect at the
Company Merger Effective Time and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) waive, or cause to be
waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting
periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate
from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied
or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time and (B) to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar
year in which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, except to the extent that such
limits or forfeitures applied under the Company Benefit Plan in effect as of the Company Merger
Effective Time.
(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Mergers constitutes a “change in
control” or “change or control”  (or a term of similar import) for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan
that contains a definition of a “change in control” or “change or control”  (or a term of similar import), as
applicable.
(d) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries,
including any “employee benefit plan”  (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation,
A-42 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level
of benefits and vesting, each Company Employee’s service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be
treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer
of all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its successors and
assigns); provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.
(e) Each participant in a Company Benefit Plan that is an annual cash incentive plan (each, an
“Annual Incentive Plan”) shall receive a cash bonus in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs; provided that, such bonus shall be no
less than (i) with respect to the portion of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs ending on the
Closing Date, an amount equal to the cash bonus calculated under the applicable Annual Incentive Plan
based on the projected full-year actual performance under the applicable Annual Incentive Plan as of
the Closing, prorated for the portion of the year elapsed between the beginning of the fiscal year in
which the Closing occurs and the Closing Date (the “Pre-Closing Bonus”) and (ii) with respect to the
remainder of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, an amount equal to no less than full-year target
performance for each participant under the applicable Annual Incentive Plan for the fiscal year in which
the Closing occurs, prorated for the portion of the year elapsed between the Closing Date and the end
of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs (the “Post-Closing Bonus” and, together with the Pre-
Closing Bonus, the “Closing Year Bonus”). Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to, pay the amount payable, if any, under the applicable Annual Incentive Plan
to the applicable Company Employees at the same time that such bonuses are typically paid in the
ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Company Employee
is terminated by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, without Cause (as
defined in the Company Stock Plan) following the Closing but prior to the payment date for such bonus
amounts, if any, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to,
pay to such Company Employee, at such time set forth in the preceding sentence, an amount equal to
the sum of (x) the applicable Pre-Closing Bonus and (y) a portion of the applicable Post-Closing Bonus
pro-rated based on the number of days the applicable Company Employee was employed between the
Closing Date and the end of the performance period.

5.08 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.08 is
intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee

the Surviving Entities from amending or terminating any of their respective benefit plans (including any
Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms), (iii) prevent Parent, after the Company Merger
Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries

The Board of Directors 
Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. 
3 Bala Plaza East 
Suite 502 
Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004
Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Radius Class A Common Stock”), of
Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. (“Radius”) of the Merger Consideration (defined below) to be received by
such holders pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) proposed to be entered into among Radius, APW OpCo LLC (“OpCo”),
Chord Parent, Inc. (“Parent”), Chord Merger Sub I, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub
I”) and Chord Merger Sub II, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub I (“Merger Sub II”). As more
fully described in the Merger Agreement, (a) (i) Merger Sub I will be merged with and into Radius and (ii)
Merger Sub II will be merged with and into OpCo (the “Mergers”) and (b) each outstanding share of the
Radius Class A Common Stock, other than (i) Appraisal Shares and (ii) Owned Company Common Stock
(each as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $15.00, in cash (the
“Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Mergers are more fully set forth in the Merger
Agreement.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed a draft, dated March 1, 2023, of the Merger Agreement and held
discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives and advisors of Radius
concerning the business, operations and prospects of Radius. We examined certain publicly available
business and financial information relating to Radius as well as certain financial forecasts and other
information and data relating to Radius which were provided to or discussed with us by the management of
Radius. We reviewed the financial terms of the Mergers as set forth in the Merger Agreement in relation to,
among other things: current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Radius Class A Common
Stock; the historical and projected earnings and other operating data of Radius; and the capitalization and
financial condition of Radius. In connection with our engagement and at the direction of Radius, we were
requested to approach, and we held discussions with, third parties to solicit indications of interest in the
possible acquisition of Radius. In addition to the foregoing, we conducted such other analyses and
examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and market criteria as we
deemed appropriate in arriving at our opinion. The issuance of our opinion has been authorized by our
fairness opinion committee.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the
accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to
or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and upon the assurances of the management of Radius that
they are not aware of any relevant information that has been omitted or that remains undisclosed to us. With
respect to financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Radius provided to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with us, we have been advised by the management of Radius, and we have
assumed, with your consent, that such financial forecasts and other information and data were reasonably
prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Radius as to, and are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate, the future financial
performance of Radius and the other matters covered thereby. We express no view or opinion as to any
financial forecasts and other information or data (or underlying assumptions on which any such financial
forecasts and other information or data are based) provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with
us.
