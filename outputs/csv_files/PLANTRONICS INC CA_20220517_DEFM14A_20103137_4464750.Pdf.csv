Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (which we refer to as the “DGCL”), at the effective time of the merger: (1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Poly; (2) the separate
existence of Merger Sub will cease; and (3) Poly will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of HP.
Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “surviving corporation” to refer to Poly as the surviving corporation following the merger.
As a result of the merger, Poly will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital
stock of the surviving corporation.
The time at which the merger becomes effective (which we refer to as the “effective time of the merger”) will occur upon the filing of a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later date and time as Poly, HP and Merger Sub may agree and
specify in such certificate of merger).

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, and without any action on the part of
the holder, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement), will be canceled and cease to exist, and
will be automatically converted into the right to receive $40.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to this
amount as the “per share price.”
At or prior to the closing of the merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated paying agent to pay the aggregate per
share price. Once a stockholder has provided the paying agent with his, her or its documentation specified by the paying agent, then the paying
agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate per share price. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Paying Agent, Exchange Fund, and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share price for each share of our common stock that you own, but you
will no longer have any rights as a Poly stockholder (except that Poly stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not validly
withdraw or subsequently lose, their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined
pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by the DGCL, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—

solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote

be treated in the following manner in connection with the merger. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Conversion of Shares—Equity Awards; ESPP.”
Treatment of Poly Equity-Based Awards
•
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each share of Poly restricted stock that is outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as “Poly Restricted Stock”) will vest in full and become free of restrictions as of the
effective time of the merger and will be converted into the right to receive the per share price under the same terms and conditions as
apply to the receipt of the merger consideration by holders of our common stock generally.
•
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, restricted stock units that were granted prior to the date of the merger
agreement (which we refer to as “Poly RSUs”) (and excluding any Poly interim restricted stock units that were or may be granted on or
after the date of the merger agreement (which we refer to as “Poly Interim RSUs”)) that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares
of our common stock subject to such Poly RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (B) the per share
price. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after
the effective time of the merger.
•
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, performance-based restricted stock units that were granted prior to the date
of the merger agreement (which we refer to as “Poly PSUs”) (and
5Table of Contents
excluding any Poly interim performance-based restricted stock units that were or may be granted on or after the date of the merger
agreement (which we refer to as “Poly Interim PSUs”)) that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the total number of shares of our common stock
subject to such Poly PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (calculated based on the terms of the Poly equity plan
and applicable award agreement governing such Poly PSU and based on actual performance against performance targets with such
performance determined as of five business days prior to the effective time of the merger) multiplied by (B) the per share price. This
amount (less any required withholdings and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after the
effective time of the merger.
•
Poly Interim RSUs (including Poly Converted Interim RSUs (as defined below)) that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will be either (in the sole discretion of HP):
•
(A) assumed by HP and converted into restricted stock units of HP with respect to a number of shares of HP’s common stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of our
common stock subject to such Poly Interim RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger by (ii) the quotient obtained
by dividing (a) the per share price by (b) the average closing price per share of HP’s common stock on the NYSE for the ten
trading-day period ending on the trading day preceding the closing date of the merger, but subject to the vesting schedule that is
applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger and the other terms and conditions
applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger; or
•
(B) canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the total number of shares of our common
stock subject to such Poly Interim RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (ii) the per share price,
with such amount payable on the vesting schedule that is applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to
the closing of the merger and otherwise subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect
immediately prior to the closing of the merger (we refer to such consideration described in prior clause (A) or clause (B) as the
“Poly Interim RSU Merger Consideration”). For any consideration described in prior clause (A), HP will issue the Poly Interim
RSU Merger Consideration in the form of restricted stock units covering shares of HP’s common stock at or reasonably promptly
after the effective time of the merger, or for any consideration described in prior clause (B), the Poly Interim RSU Merger
Consideration will be paid in cash (less any required withholding and other taxes) according to the applicable vesting schedule,
to each holder of Poly Interim RSUs with respect to such holder’s Poly Interim RSUs.
•
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly Interim PSUs will be canceled and exchanged for Poly RSUs (which, as
so converted, we refer to as “Poly Converted Interim RSUs”) with respect to a number of shares of our common stock equal to the
number of shares of our common stock subject to such Poly Interim PSU with respect to target performance and with the same
remaining time-based vesting schedule that would have been applicable had the Poly Interim PSU stock unit been initially granted as a
Poly Interim RSU and such award will be treated as a Poly Interim RSU as described above.
Treatment of Poly Options
•
Stock options (which we refer to as “Poly options”) that have an exercise price per share of our common stock that is less than the per
share price, whether or not exercisable or vested, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash determined
by multiplying (A) the excess of the per share price over the exercise price of such Poly option by (B) the number of shares of our
common stock

Table of Contents
subject to such Poly option. This amount (less any required withholdings and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or
reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger.
•
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly options that have an exercise price per share of our common stock that
is equal to or greater than the per share price, whether or not exercisable or vested, that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be canceled without payment.
Treatment of the ESPP
The Plantronics, Inc. Amended and Restated 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which we refer to as the “ESPP”) will be frozen and
suspended at the end of the offering period that is in progress as of the date of the merger agreement and no new offering periods will commence
under the ESPP at any time on or after the date of the merger agreement. No current participants in the ESPP will be permitted to increase their payroll
deduction elections or rate of contributions under the ESPP from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement or make any separate non-
payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement. If any offering period that is in progress as of the date of the
merger agreement continues to be in progress as of the effective time of the merger, such offering period will be shortened in accordance with the
terms of the ESPP to a date on or prior to the closing date of the merger. The ESPP will terminate prior to, and contingent upon, the effective time of

employees credit for all service with Poly and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger, to the extent that such service was credited for
the applicable purpose prior to the effective time of the merger, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where
length of service is relevant, except that such service will not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits.
In addition, with respect to any health plan maintained by HP or any of its subsidiaries in which continuing employees are eligible to
participate after the effective time of the merger, HP will, and will cause the surviving corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) waive
all limitations as to all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements,
actively-at-work or similar requirements, and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees
and their covered dependents to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees and their covered
dependents under the welfare plans of Poly and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger; and (2) provide any eligible expenses

receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown)
interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of
payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any
time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to stockholders seeking appraisal,
interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the
9Table of Contents
Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make
such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a
written demand for appraisal to Poly before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in
favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold the subject shares of our common stock of record through the effective
time of the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the
procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal
proceedings in respect of Poly unless certain conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal, as described further below. The
requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is
qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which is attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for
appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.

will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, and will not authorize or permit any of their respective directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives to:

advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as defined in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Acquisition Offers”) and the Poly Board determines in good faith,

written notice of its decision to take such action, the identity of the person making such takeover proposal or inquiry, the terms of such proposal or
inquiry and unredacted copies of agreements and similar documents and material correspondence relating to such proposal or inquiry. For purposes
of the non-solicitation covenant, a “deemed breach” is any action taken by a person listed in Exhibit A to the confidentiality agreement between
Poly and HP (as amended), any Poly director, any Poly employee with the title of senior vice president or more senior or any financial or legal adviser
to Poly that, if taken by Poly, would be a breach of the non-solicitation covenant, or (if Poly is aware of the action and fails to promptly use its

Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On March 25, 2022, we entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, HP will acquire Poly for $40.00 in cash per share of our
common stock. In order to complete the merger, our stockholders representing a majority of all issued and outstanding common stock must vote to
adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This approval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.” The Poly Board is furnishing this proxy statement and
form of proxy card to the holders of shares of our common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the
special meeting.
This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement, the special meeting
and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock
without attending the special meeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.
Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as possible.
Q:
What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Poly?
A:
The proposed merger is the acquisition of Poly by HP. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by our stockholders and the other
closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Poly, with Poly continuing as the
surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Poly will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HP, and our common stock will no longer be
publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no
longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $40.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each
share of our common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal
rights under the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock, you
will receive $4,000.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
How does the per share price compare to the market price of Poly’s common stock?
A:
This amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 47 percent to the closing price of our common stock on March 24, 2022; and (2) a premium
of approximately 47 percent to Poly’s 30-trading day average closing stock price ending on March 24, 2022.

Q:
What will happen to Poly equity-based awards?
A:
Generally speaking, at or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly equity-based awards that are outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger will be treated as follows:
•
Each share of Poly Restricted Stock will vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the per share price under the same terms and
conditions as apply to the receipt of the merger consideration by holders of our common stock generally.
•
Outstanding Poly RSUs will be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of our
common stock subject to such Poly RSUs immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (B) the per share price. This
amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after the effective time
of the merger.
•
Outstanding Poly PSUs will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the total number of shares of
our common stock subject to such Poly PSUs immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (calculated based on the terms of the Poly
equity plan and applicable award agreement governing such Poly PSUs and based on actual performance against performance targets with
such performance determined as of five business days prior to the effective time of the merger) multiplied by (B) the per share price. This
amount (less any required withholdings and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after the effective time
of the merger.
•
Outstanding Poly Interim RSUs will be either (in the sole discretion of HP) (i) assumed by HP and converted into restricted units of HP with
respect to a number of shares of HP’s common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the number of shares of our
common stock subject to such Poly Interim RSUs immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (a) the per share price
divided by (b) the average closing price per share of HP’s common stock on the NYSE for the ten trading-day period ending on the trading
day preceding the date of the closing of the merger, and such assumed restricted stock unit will be subject to the vesting schedule that is
applicable to such Poly Interim RSUs and the other terms and conditions applicable to such Poly Interim RSUs as in effect immediately prior
to the closing of the merger; or (ii) canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the total number of shares of
our common stock subject to such Poly Interim RSUs immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by the per share price,
with such amount payable on the vesting schedule that is applicable to such Poly Interim RSUs as in effect immediately prior to the closing of
the merger and otherwise subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to such Poly Interim RSUs as in effect immediately prior to the
closing of the merger.
•
Outstanding Poly Interim PSUs will be canceled and exchanged for Poly Interim RSUs with respect to the number of shares of our common
stock equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to such Poly Interim PSUs with respect to target performance and with the
same remaining time-based vesting schedule that would have been applicable had the Poly Interim PSUs been initially granted as a Poly
Interim RSUs, and such award will be treated as Poly Interim RSUs as described above.
•
Outstanding vested and unvested Poly options that have an exercise price per share less than the per share price will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the per share price (less the exercise price per share for such stock option)
multiplied by the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise in full of such stock options.
•
Outstanding vested and unvested Poly options that have an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the per share price will be
canceled without payment.

You may virtually attend the special meeting solely via a live interactive webcast on the internet at www.proxydocs.com/POLY. You will be able to
listen to the special meeting live and vote online. The special meeting will begin at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, on June 23, 2022. Online check-in will
begin a few minutes prior to the special meeting. You will need the control number found on your proxy card or voting instruction form in order to
participate in the special meeting (including voting your shares). As the special meeting is exclusively virtual, there will be no physical meeting
location, and you may not attend the special meeting in person.
Even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special meeting, we encourage you to
sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over
the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card). If you virtually attend the special meeting and vote at the special
meeting, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
If, as of the record date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and you wish to attend the special meeting you must obtain a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting. Otherwise, you should
instruct your bank, broker or other

Table of Contents
nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank,
broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be considered at the special meeting without your instructions. Without your
instructions, your shares will not be counted for purposes of a quorum or voted at the meeting, which will have the same effect as voting against
the adoption of the merger agreement.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
A:
All of our stockholders as of the close of business on April 28, 2022, which is the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to vote their
shares of our common stock at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 43,072,542 shares of our common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of our common stock outstanding as of the record date is entitled to one
vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to adopt the
merger agreement.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or (3) attend and vote
at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in
“street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.
Q:
What vote is required to approve (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by
Poly to its named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting?
A:
Approval of the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of
the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or (3) attend and vote
at the special meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Poly to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, or the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary
or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting, except to
the extent that such failure affects obtaining a quorum at the meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank,
broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on these proposals, except to the extent that such failure affects obtaining
a quorum at the meeting. In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals.

Table of Contents
Q:
What do I. need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement
carefully and consider how the merger affects you. Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, please sign, date and return, as promptly
as possible, the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided for your convenience), or grant your proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy card), to ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting. If you hold
your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee for information on how to
vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
Q:
How does the Poly Board recommend that I vote?
A:
The Poly Board recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become
payable by Poly to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to
time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate as determined in good faith by the Poly Board, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of our common stock. Instead: (1) Poly will remain an independent public company; (2) our common stock will
continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
In specified circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, Poly has agreed to pay HP a termination fee. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee and Remedies.”
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to its named executive officers in
connection with the merger?
A:
Poly is required to seek stockholder approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger. Stockholder approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger is not required to consummate the merger.
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is certain compensation
that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of Poly’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and arrangements that
are contractual in nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by HP or its affiliates to our named executive officers in connection with or
following the merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 2:
Approval, on a Non-Binding, Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation.”
20
Table of Contents
Q:
What will happen if Poly’s stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to its named executive officers
in connection with the merger?
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is not a
condition to consummation of the merger. This is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Poly or HP. The underlying plans and arrangements
providing for such compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is consummated, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Poly to our named executive officers in connection with the merger will or may be paid to Poly’s named executive officers even if our
stockholders do not approve such compensation.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to
those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly
to you by or on behalf of Poly. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares at the special meeting using
the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of our common stock held in
“street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to you
by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner,
you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also
invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you must obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank,
broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the special
meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares. Without instruction, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of obtaining a quorum or voted on the
proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger or the adjournment proposal, except to the extent affecting the obtaining of a quorum at the meeting.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company,
N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is enclosed for your convenience);
•
by visiting the internet address on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on your proxy card.
21
Table of Contents
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of our common stock and to
confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is
no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and
telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of our common stock by proxy. If you are a
stockholder of record or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may vote your shares of our common stock at
the special meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your vote will
revoke any previously submitted proxy.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker
or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or nominee. However, because
you are not the stockholder of record, you must obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your
shares at the special meeting.
Q:
Why did Poly choose to hold a virtual special meeting?
A:
The Poly Board decided to hold the special meeting virtually in response to public health concerns over large gatherings of people and in order to
help limit potential transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, our experience with virtual meetings demonstrated that the goals of accessibility and
stockholder participation can be well served by the virtual format.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of our common stock. The written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy
to vote your shares of our common stock is called a “proxy card.” You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to designate a proxy by
telephone or by the Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. David M. Shull, Charles D. Boynton and
Lisa Bodensteiner, each with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy holders for the special meeting.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
•
attending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed proxy card.
If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or nominee that you must follow
in order to submit your voting instructions and have your shares voted at the special meeting. You may also vote at the special meeting if you
obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.
22
Table of Contents
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares in the way that
you direct.
If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the Poly Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1)
“FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if
necessary or appropriate as determined in good faith by the Poly Board, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to
send your stock certificates to the paying agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented
by your stock certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash
payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you hold your shares of our common stock in
book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead, the paying agent will pay you the appropriate portion of the merger
consideration upon receipt of a customary “agent’s message” and any other items specified by the paying agent.
Q:
What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting?
A:
The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective date of the merger. If you sell or
transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a
proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies Poly in writing of such special
arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share price with respect to such shares, if the merger is completed, to the person to
whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your
shares of our common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is
provided for your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the instructions found on the proxy
card).
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy card and voting instruction form
that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than
one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a
stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting
materials that you receive.

Table of Contents
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
A:
If available, Poly may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. Poly intends to publish final voting results in a
Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Poly files with the SEC are publicly available
when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
our common stock surrendered in the merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger
unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding unless the Non-U.S. Holder
complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax
consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax
laws or the laws of any territory, state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and does not
constitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q:
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the merger by the end of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted
because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q:
What governmental and regulatory approvals are required?
A:
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has
expired or been terminated. Additionally, under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until all consents, approvals and
filings required under the specified foreign regulatory laws have been obtained or made.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the merger is consummated and certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, (2) continuously hold their applicable shares of our common stock through the effective time of the
merger, (3) properly demand appraisal of their shares, (4) meet certain statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement and (5) do not
withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger
under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and
24
Table of Contents
to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the
amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the
judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the
period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before
the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest
will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to
make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek
the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements
for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”,
which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
Q:
Do any of Poly’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Poly stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Poly Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that
our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally. In: (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that
the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Poly Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at
the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Poly’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
Q:

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or other written
statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts,
including, without limitation, statements relating to the completion of the merger. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of
forward-looking words, such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,”
“forecast,” “intend,” “target,” “possible” and other words of similar import, or the negative versions of such words. Our stockholders are cautioned that
any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may
vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings
with the SEC, including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement, and the following factors:
•
the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of our stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or the failure to satisfy the other
conditions to the completion of the merger, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary
regulatory approval;
•
the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right to terminate the merger, and the risk that the
merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay a termination fee;
•
the nature, cost and outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the merger agreement;
•
risks that the merger affects our current operations or our ability to retain or recruit employees;
•
economic, market, business or geopolitical conditions (including resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, or the
military conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions against Russia and Belarus) or competition, or changes in such conditions, negatively
affecting Poly’s business, operations and financial performance;
•
the fact that receipt of the all-cash per share price will be taxable to our stockholders that are treated as U.S. Holders for U.S. federal income
tax purposes;
•
the fact that, if the merger is completed, our stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful
execution of Poly’s current strategy as an independent company;
•
the possibility that Poly could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special dividends or the
sale of some or all of Poly assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably produce a higher aggregate value than
that available to our stockholders in the merger;
•
the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Poly is restrained at certain times from soliciting other acquisition proposals during
the pendency of the merger;
•
the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships, customers, operating results and business
generally, including risks related to the diversion of the attention of Poly management or employees during the pendency of the merger;
•
the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger agreement or the merger;
•
the risk that the proposed merger will not be consummated in a timely manner, exceeding the expected costs of the merger; and
•
the risk that our stock price may fluctuate during the pendency of the merger and may decline significantly if the merger is not completed.

Only our stockholders as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. A list of
stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available at our corporate offices located at 345 Encinal Street, Santa Cruz, California
95060, during regular business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the special meeting.
As of the record date, there were 43,072,542 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of our
common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted for a vote at the

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock as of the record date. Adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders is a condition to the closing of the merger.
Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the
shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted: (1) “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement; (2) “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become payable by Poly
to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “AGAINST” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, to a
later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate as determined in good faith by the Poly Board, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum
exists.
A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because
the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote your shares. We do not expect any
“broker non-votes” at the special meeting, but if there are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If there
are broker non-votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on: (1)
the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger; or (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate as
determined in good faith by the Poly Board, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the

Appraisal Rights
If the merger is consummated and certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, (2) continuously hold their applicable shares of our common stock through the effective time of the
merger, (3) properly demand appraisal of their shares, (4) meet certain statutory requirements described in this proxy statement and (5) do not withdraw

31Table of Contents
in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise
for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established
from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that,
if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking
appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish
to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek
appraisal of their shares.
Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a written
demand for appraisal to Poly before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold the subject shares of our common stock of record through the effective time of the merger;
and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified
under the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Poly
unless certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal. The requirements under Section 262
of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section
262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold

nominee.

Merger Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of HP and was formed on March 18, 2022, solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Merger Sub has not engaged in any business activities other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. At the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into Poly and Merger Sub will cease to exist.
Effect of the Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, (1)
Merger Sub will merge with and into Poly; (2) the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease; and (3) Poly will continue as the surviving corporation in
the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of HP.
34Table of Contents
As a result of the merger, Poly will cease to be a publicly traded company, our common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under
the Exchange Act and Poly will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the
surviving corporation.
The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later
date and time as we, HP and Merger Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).
Effect on Poly if the Merger is Not Completed
If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, (1) Poly will remain an independent public company; (2) our
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports
with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that: (1) our management will continue to operate the business as it is currently being
operated; and (2) our stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks
related to the highly competitive industry in which Poly operates and adverse economic conditions.
Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the merger not to be completed, the price of our
common stock may decline significantly.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the effect of the merger not being completed on the future value of your shares of our common stock.
If the merger is not completed, the Poly Board will continue to evaluate and review, among other things, Poly’s business, operations, strategic direction
and capitalization, and will make whatever changes it deems appropriate. If the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is
not completed for any other reason, Poly’s business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely impacted.
In specified circumstances in which the transaction is terminated, Poly has agreed to pay HP the termination fee.
Per Share Price
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger:
•
each share of our common stock that is (1) held by Poly as treasury stock; (2) owned by HP or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HP or Merger Sub will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to
exist, and no consideration will be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor;
•
each share of our common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than the
shares identified in the prior bullet) and held by our stockholders who have (1) neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement nor consented thereto in writing; and (2) properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
shares in accordance with the DGCL (and have not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost such appraisal rights) will be entitled to the “fair
value” of such shares, determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding contemplated by the DGCL as described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “—Appraisal Rights”; and
•
each share of our common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than the
shares identified in the prior bullets) will automatically be canceled and retired and all such shares will cease to exist and will thereafter only
represent the right to receive the per share price.

At or prior to the closing of the merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated paying agent to pay the aggregate per share
price. Once a stockholder has provided the paying agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of a stock certificate) or
customary agent’s message with respect to book-entry shares, appropriate letter of transmittal and other items specified by the paying agent, then the
paying agent will pay the stockholder the appropriate portion of the aggregate per share price. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Paying Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the merger is completed, each of our stockholders will have the right to receive the per share price for each share of our common stock that
such stockholder owned, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conversion of Shares,” but will no
longer have any rights as a Poly stockholder (except that our stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not validly withdraw or
subsequently lose, their appraisal rights will have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their shares, determined pursuant to an appraisal
proceeding contemplated by the DGCL as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Appraisal Rights”).
Background of the Merger",42,44
PLANTRONICS INC CA_20220517_DEFM14A_20103137_4464750.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement. This chronology does not
purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Poly Board, the Strategic Committee (as defined below), our representatives, or other parties.
The Poly Board regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening our business and
enhancing stockholder value, including in the light of the opportunities and challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, work-from-home trends,
supply chain disruptions, the impact of market, customer and competitive trends and other economic and industry conditions affecting Poly. As part of
this evaluation, the Poly Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the
continuation of, and potential improvements to, our current business plan, with Poly remaining an independent entity; (2) the investment in, and
development of, new products and services, and expansion into new markets; (3) capital raising activities; (4) potential expansion opportunities through
acquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships; and (5) business combinations and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the
sale of Poly.
As active participants in the connectivity and peripherals space, HP and Poly are well known to each other. From time to time, members of Poly
management have met with members of HP management to discuss, in general terms, their industry and their respective companies, as well as ways that
the two companies could work together, including through product partnerships and product offerings.
In January 2021, Dave Shull, our president and chief executive officer, met with senior executives of HP, including Alex Cho, the president of HP’s
Personal Systems Group, to discuss industry dynamics, their respective companies, potential commercial and strategic partnerships, and other ways that
Poly and HP could work together.
On March 30, 2021, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with HP to discuss ways that Poly and HP could work together. This confidentiality
agreement did not include a “standstill” or other restriction on HP’s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire us.
In April 2021 and May 2021, members of Poly management and HP management met to discuss industry dynamics, their respective companies,
potential strategic partnerships and other ways that Poly and HP could work together. An acquisition of Poly by HP was one of many types of
transactions discussed. These discussions were preliminary and hypothetical in nature, and specific terms of an acquisition were not discussed.
36Table of Contents
Thereafter, Mr. Shull and senior executives of HP had intermittent conversations about industry dynamics and their respective companies. From
time to time, Mr. Shull updated the Poly Board on the nature of these discussions.
On November 15, 2021, Messrs. Shull and Cho met to discuss, in general terms, potential transactions between Poly and HP that could strengthen
both companies, including the possibility of a broader commercial relationship coupled with a strategic investment by HP in Poly.
On November 17, 2021, Mr. Cho spoke with Mr. Shull. During this conversation, Mr. Cho noted that HP had thought further about potential
partnerships and transactions with Poly and determined that HP preferred to acquire Poly, and that HP would be sending a letter to that effect. Mr. Shull
said that he would discuss the matter with the Poly Board.
Later, on November 17, 2021, HP submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire Poly for $40.00 in cash per share of our common stock. We
refer to this as the “Initial HP Proposal.” Mr. Shull subsequently shared the Initial HP Proposal with the Poly Board.
On November 19, 2021, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati,
Professional Corporation (which we refer to as “Wilson Sonsini”), our outside legal counsel, in attendance. Mr. Shull reviewed for the Poly Board the
nature of his prior discussions with HP and the terms of the Initial HP Proposal. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the
Poly Board their fiduciary duties. It was the consensus of the Poly Board that the Initial HP Proposal had the potential to lead to a transaction that would
be attractive to Poly and our stockholders, and that it was appropriate to have additional discussions with HP. As such, the Poly Board instructed Mr.
Shull to inform HP that the Poly Board was considering the Initial HP Proposal. To provide assistance to, and oversight of, Poly management in its
discussions with HP, as well as in view of the possibility that the Poly Board could elect to undertake a broader review of strategic alternatives in
connection with discussions with HP, the Poly Board established a strategic committee (which we refer to as the “Strategic Committee”). The Strategic
Committee was formed in the light of the benefits, convenience and efficiency of having a subset of directors oversee any process of considering
strategic alternatives in the context of (1) the potentially significant workload that could be involved in any decision by Poly to evaluate strategic
alternatives; and (2) the possibility that Poly management and our advisers would need feedback and direction on relatively short notice. The Strategic
Committee was not formed due to any actual or perceived conflict of any director or officer of Poly. The Poly Board authorized and instructed the
Strategic Committee to, among other things, (1) oversee and provide assistance to Poly management and our advisers; (2) explore, evaluate, consider,
review and negotiate the terms and conditions of any strategic alternative, including any sale of Poly; (3) take such other actions with respect to any
strategic alternative as the Strategic Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable; and (4) recommend what action, if any, that the Poly Board
should take with respect to any strategic alternative. The Poly Board retained the power and authority to approve the final decision on pursuing a
strategic alternative, including a sale of Poly. It was also understood that the Poly Board would continue to have an active role in the consideration of
strategic alternatives, and that the Strategic Committee would update and seek input from the Poly Board as appropriate. The Poly Board appointed Brian
Dexheimer, Robert C. Hagerty, Marshall Mohr and Marvin Tseu as the members of the Strategic Committee. These individuals were selected because of,
among other things, their substantial familiarity with Poly and its business and their experience in similar circumstances. Mr. Hagerty was subsequently
designated as the chairperson of the Strategic Committee. The Poly Board did not provide for the payment of any compensation to the members of the
Strategic Committee in consideration of their service on the committee (other than their ordinary course compensation as members of the Poly Board).
The Poly Board discussed the retention of a financial adviser to assist us in connection with evaluating a transaction with HP, as well as with any broader
review of strategic alternatives. The Poly Board identified Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser who could provide such assistance. Morgan Stanley is
well known to the Poly Board given Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, extensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which
Poly operates and experience in advising similar companies in connection with potential

strategic transactions. The Poly Board authorized the Strategic Committee to (1) assess Morgan Stanley’s qualifications and independence to serve as
our financial adviser; and (2) work with Poly management to determine if Morgan Stanley was available to assist us. Morgan Stanley was subsequently
contacted, and it was determined that they could provide assistance to us.
On November 24, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The
representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the Initial HP Proposal from a financial point of view. The Strategic Committee reviewed ways to potentially
improve that proposal for the benefit of our stockholders.
On November 29, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed potential responses to the Initial HP Proposal. The Strategic Committee
determined to recommend to the Poly Board that it reject the Initial HP Proposal but signal a willingness to assist HP in better understanding our long-
term business plans (including by providing due diligence information) so that HP could improve the value of its acquisition proposal. The Strategic
Committee discussed the possibility of contacting other parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly. It was noted that such contact had the risk of
creating opportunities for public speculation that we were pursuing a sale, and that such speculation could be harmful to us and our employees and
business partners. The Strategic Committee determined not to initiate such contact at that time due to the potential impact of these risks to us, our
employees and our business partners. After the departure of the representatives of Morgan Stanley from the meeting, the Strategic Committee (1)
discussed Morgan Stanley’s qualifications and independence in connection with serving as our financial adviser; and (2) determined to recommend that
the Poly Board engage Morgan Stanley.
On November 30, 2021, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The members
of the Strategic Committee noted that they were supportive of engaging Morgan Stanley as our financial adviser. The Poly Board discussed Morgan
Stanley’s qualifications and independence in connection with serving as our financial adviser, including earlier discussions with the Strategic Committee
during which representatives of Morgan Stanley generally described Morgan Stanley’s historical relationships with HP and its affiliates. Following the
discussion, the Poly Board approved the engagement of Morgan Stanley as our financial adviser and instructed the Strategic Committee to negotiate and
enter into an appropriate engagement letter with Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley joined the meeting and reviewed the Initial HP
Proposal from a financial point of view and discussed with the Poly Board potential responses. The members of the Strategic Committee provided their
recommendation that the Poly Board reject the Initial HP Proposal but signal a willingness to assist HP in better understanding our long-term business
plans (including by providing due diligence information) so that HP could improve the value of its acquisition proposal. It was the consensus of the Poly
Board to accept the recommendation of the Strategic Committee.
On December 1, 2021, at the direction of the Poly Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Poly management spoke with representatives of
each of HP and HP’s financial advisers, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (which were refer to as “Goldman Sachs”) and Foros Securities LLC (which we refer to
as “Foros”), regarding the Poly Board’s determination. The representatives of HP expressed a willingness to undertake a due diligence review of our
business and long-term plans.
On December 3, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley and members of Poly management discussed their conversation on December 1, 2021, with
representatives of each of HP, Goldman Sachs and Foros. The members of Poly management reviewed with the Strategic Committee a draft of Poly’s
current long-term business plan and described, among other things, Poly management’s process for preparing Poly’s long-term business plan, including
the underlying assumptions and various execution and other risks to realizing the forecasted results. As part of this discussion, the members of Poly
the underlying assumptions and various execution and other risks to realizing the forecasted results. As part of this discussion, the members of Poly
management described the Credit Case, which was initially prepared for the information of the lender under Poly’s revolving credit facility. As described
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Prospective Unaudited Financial
38
Table of Contents
Information,” the Credit Case assumed (1) the continuation of supply constraints for fiscal year 2023 impacting revenue; (2) growth rates in fiscal year
2024 and fiscal year 2025 that were consistent with industry analyst market growth rate assumptions; and (3) a negative impact to gross margin and
operating margin in fiscal year 2023 due to higher component and freight costs consistent with those experienced in fiscal year 2022, and improvements to
gross margin and operating margin thereafter as supply constraints and freight costs normalize. The members of Poly management also described the
Field Case, which was characterized as reflecting a more optimistic, but potentially achievable, forecast than the Credit Case. As described in the section
of this proxy statement captioned “—Prospective Unaudited Financial Information,” the Field Case assumed (1) a still constrained but improved supply
chain in fiscal year 2023 as a result of component replacements and increased supply; (2) growth rates in fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 that were
consistent with industry analyst market growth rate assumptions; and (3) a negative impact to gross margin and operating margin in fiscal year 2023 due
to higher component and freight costs consistent with those experienced in fiscal year 2022 but with some offset due to lower-cost replacement parts, and
improvements to gross margin and operating margin thereafter as supply constraints and freight costs normalize. Following the departure from the
meeting of the representatives of Morgan Stanley, the Strategic Committee discussed and agreed on an appropriate compensation structure for Morgan
Stanley. The Strategic Committee instructed Poly management to finalize the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley.
On December 8, 2021, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in
attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley and members of Poly management discussed their conversation on December 1, 2021, with
representatives of each of HP, Goldman Sachs and Foros. The members of Poly management reviewed with the Poly Board a draft of Poly’s current long-
term business plan and described, among other things, Poly management’s process for preparing Poly’s long-term business plan, including the
underlying assumptions and various execution and other risks to realizing the forecasted results. As part of this discussion, the members of Poly
management described the Credit Case and the Field Case in the same manner that they had done at the meeting of the Strategic Committee on December
3, 2021. The Poly Board noted the current supply chain challenges and the impact that those challenges were having on us, including on Poly
management’s ability to forecast our future results. The Poly Board approved both the Credit Case and the Field Case, and authorized Morgan Stanley to
use both for purposes of its financial analyses of Poly and to share both with HP. In making such approval, and in the light of the uncertainty regarding
current and future supply chain challenges and other related market and industry disruptions facing us, the Poly Board did not adopt either the Credit
Case or the Field Case as the single best predictor of our future financial and operating results. Rather, the Poly Board noted that each director, and the
members of Poly management, had different perspectives on the Credit Case and the Field Case and the risks to achieving the financial results implied by
both cases, and that the Credit Case and the Field Case represented reasonable alternative estimates of our future financial results in the light of the
uncertainty facing us. The Poly Board did not conclude that either the Credit Case or the Field Case was more likely to be achieved than the other.
On December 10, 2021, we entered into an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley.
On December 12, 2021, members of Poly management, together with representatives of Morgan Stanley, discussed certain aspects of our business,
including portions of the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information, with members of HP management and representatives of both of HP’s financial
advisers. In the days following this meeting, members of Poly management and representatives of Morgan Stanley continued to meet with members of HP
management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Foros to discuss the due diligence materials being provided by us to HP.
On December 13, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The Strategic Committee received an update on the meeting with HP and its representatives that occurred the prior day.
On December 15, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan
39
Table of Contents
Stanley reviewed the Initial HP Proposal from a financial point of view based on information provided by Poly’s management, including the Credit Case
and the Field Case, and publicly available information. Consistent with the Poly Board’s instructions, no relative prioritization or weight was attributed to
either case.
On December 20, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley described the due diligence information being shared with HP. The Strategic Committee
discussed the possibility of contacting other parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee to
consider this further at a future meeting.
On December 22, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The status of
HP’s due diligence review was discussed. The Strategic Committee discussed the possibility of contacting other parties regarding their interest in
acquiring Poly. It was noted that such contact had the risk of creating opportunities for public speculation that we were pursuing a sale, and that such
speculation could be harmful to us and our employees and business partners. The Strategic Committee determined not to undertake such contact at that
time.
On December 23, 2021, Mr. Cho spoke with Mr. Shull concerning the status of HP’s evaluation of a potential acquisition of us.
On December 24, 2021, HP reaffirmed, in a non-binding written proposal, its desire to acquire us on the terms set forth in the Initial HP Proposal. We
refer to this as the “Reaffirmed Initial HP Proposal.” This proposal was accompanied by a draft of the merger agreement and proposed a transaction
timeline to announce the transaction concurrently with our quarterly earnings release.
On December 27, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The Reaffirmed Initial HP Proposal was discussed. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee to discuss with the Poly Board
(1) the Reaffirmed Initial HP Proposal; (2) a possible counterproposal to HP for an acquisition of us with a price per share in the $50s; and (3) the
possibility of contacting other parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly.
On December 29, 2021, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in
attendance. The members of Poly management described their perspectives on various financial and strategic opportunities in front of Poly and ways that
they would manage and position Poly in order to capture those opportunities. The Poly Board noted the current supply chain challenges and the impact
that those challenges were having on Poly, including on Poly management’s ability to forecast our future results and achieve our projected financial and
operating results. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the Reaffirmed Initial HP Proposal from a financial point of view based on information
provided by Poly’s management, including the Credit Case and the Field Case, and publicly available information. The Poly Board discussed the
possibility of contacting other parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly, including the potential risks and impacts to us, our employees and our
business partners of making such contact. It was the consensus of the Poly Board not to undertake such contact at that time. It was also the consensus
of the Poly Board not to accept the Reaffirmed Initial HP Proposal and to make a counterproposal to HP for an acquisition of Poly by HP for $50.00 in cash
per share of our common stock. We refer to this as the “Initial Poly Counterproposal.” Representatives of Morgan Stanley subsequently conveyed the
Initial Poly Counterproposal to both of HP’s financial advisers on December 30, 2021, as directed by the Poly Board.
On January 5, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. Members of Poly management provided an update on our financial and operating results for our fiscal third quarter. The
representatives of Morgan Stanley noted
40
Table of Contents
that, based on earlier conversations with both of HP’s financial advisers, HP was still considering the Initial Poly Counterproposal. The Strategic
Committee discussed the possibility of contacting other parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly. After considering the benefits and risks to Poly,
the Strategic Committee determined that it was appropriate to contact a potential strategic acquirer (which we refer to as “Party A”) regarding its interest
in a potential acquisition of us, and directed Morgan Stanley to do so. The Strategic Committee selected Party A based on its view that Party A, among
alternative potential acquirers, may be interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of Poly, and had the capability to engage in, and consummate, a
transaction expeditiously and on terms that would be attractive to Poly and its stockholders and that would be competitive with HP’s proposals.
On January 6, 2022, members of Poly management met with members of HP management to discuss Poly’s financial performance.
On January 7, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with representatives of Party A about Party A’s interest in a potential acquisition of
us. The representatives of Party A expressed a desire to further discuss the opportunity.
On January 12, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The nature of engagement by Party A, as well as the upcoming management meeting with Party A, was discussed. The Strategic
Committee considered whether to contact other parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly, including any potential financial acquirers. As part of
this discussion, the representatives of Morgan Stanley noted that, on January 9, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley had a conversation with
representatives of a prominent financial acquirer in which they explored, on a hypothetical basis and as part of a larger discussion regarding market
dynamics and transaction opportunities, whether that financial acquirer would have any interest in considering a potential acquisition of a company like
Poly. The financial acquirer did not express any such interest. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed with members of the Strategic Committee
why we might not be a likely acquisition candidate for a financial acquirer given, among other things, our business profile, declining growth and margins,
and uncertain future financial performance. The Strategic Committee determined not to contact additional parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly
at that time.
On January 13, 2022, members of Poly management and representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed certain aspects of our business with members
of Party A management. In the days following this meeting, members of Poly management and representatives of Morgan Stanley continued to discuss
with members of Party A management the due diligence materials being provided by us to Party A. We and Party A engaged in these conversations and
information sharing in reliance on an existing confidentiality agreement between the parties that was entered into in May 2020. This confidentiality
agreement did not include a “standstill” or other restriction on Party A’s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire us.
On January 14, 2022, HP submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire us for $42.25 in cash per share of our common stock. We refer to this
as the “Second HP Proposal.”
Later on January 14, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and
Morgan Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the recent meeting with Party A and discussed the Second HP Proposal.
The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the Second HP Proposal from a financial point of view based on information provided by Poly’s
management, including the Credit Case and the Field Case, and publicly available information. Mr. Shull noted the challenges facing our business and
industry in the near term and the potential negative market perception of those challenges. The Strategic Committee determined to allow HP to conduct
additional due diligence, with the understanding (to be conveyed to both of HP’s financial advisers by representatives of Morgan Stanley) that the price
in an acquisition of Poly by HP was not yet agreed, and such message was delivered by Morgan Stanley to representatives of HP shortly after this
meeting. The Strategic Committee
41
Table of Contents
discussed the possibility of contacting additional parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly. After considering the benefits and risks to Poly of
these contacts, the Strategic Committee directed the representatives of Morgan Stanley to speak with a potential strategic acquirer (which we refer to as
“Party B”) regarding its interest in a possible acquisition of us. The Strategic Committee selected Party B based on its view that Party B, among
alternative acquirers, may be interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of Poly, and had the capability to engage in, and consummate, a transaction
expeditiously and on terms that would be attractive to Poly and its stockholders and competitive with HP’s proposals.
On January 15, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with members of Party B management. The members of Party B management
informed the representatives of Morgan Stanley that Party B was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of Poly at that time.
Also on January 15, 2022, both of HP’s financial advisers informed Morgan Stanley that HP required more clarity on Poly’s position regarding the
Second HP Proposal, including with respect to the proposed price per share. After discussing HP’s request with members of each of Poly management
and the Strategic Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley, acting pursuant to direction from Poly, informed both of HP’s financial advisers that the
Strategic Committee could be supportive of an acquisition proposal at $45.00 in cash per share of our common stock.
On January 16, 2022, both of HP’s financial advisers communicated to Morgan Stanley HP’s increased acquisition proposal of $42.55 in cash per
share of our common stock. We refer to this as the “Third HP Proposal.”
On January 18, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley (1) reviewed the Third HP Proposal from a financial point of view; (2) described their
conversation with members of Party B management; and (3) noted the due diligence information being provided to Party A. The Strategic Committee
discussed parties other than Party A and Party B that it could contact regarding their interest in a strategic transaction with us, including the potential
risks and impacts to our business of making such contact. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee to discuss the matter further with the Poly
Board. The Strategic Committee (1) confirmed its prior decision to allow HP to conduct additional due diligence; (2) determined to continue to provide due
diligence information to Party A; and (3) determined that it would recommend that the Poly Board accept the Third HP Proposal.
Later on January 18, 2022, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The members of Poly management provided an update on the status of our business, and noted the ongoing supply chain and
other challenges facing us, along with the risks associated with achieving some or all of the financial results implied by the Prospective Unaudited
Financial Information. The terms of the Third HP Proposal were reviewed, including the Strategic Committee’s recommendation that the Poly Board accept
that proposal. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the Third HP Proposal from a financial point of view based on information provided by
Poly’s management, including the Credit Case and the Field Case, and publicly available information, including the then-current version of the Street Case
(as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Prospective Unaudited Financial Information”). The Poly Board and the representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed strategic acquirers other than Party A and Party B that might have an interest in an acquisition of us, including as to our
strategic fit with each potential acquirer and the ability of each potential acquirer to engage in, and consummate, an acquisition of us. It was noted that
Party A continued to consider pursuing an acquisition of us. The Poly Board noted (1) the risk that a broader transaction solicitation process could result
in opportunities for public speculation that we were pursuing a sale, and that such speculation could be harmful to us and our employees and business
partners; and (2) the various execution risks and challenges related to an acquisition of us by potential strategic acquirers, including from a regulatory
perspective. In the light of these considerations, the Poly Board determined that the risks to contacting additional potential strategic acquirers
outweighed the benefits (but that
42
Table of Contents
Poly and its advisers should continue to engage with Party A as long as it was continuing to consider an acquisition of us). The Poly Board also
considered whether to contact any potential financial acquirers. It was determined that, in the light of our business profile, operational outlook and
uncertain future financial performance, it would be unlikely that a financial acquirer would present an acquisition proposal that the Poly Board was likely
to find of interest and be competitive with the terms of the Third HP Proposal. In the light of this consideration, and the risks to us that a broader
transaction solicitation process could result in opportunities for public speculation that we were pursuing a sale, the Poly Board determined not to
contact any potential financial acquirers. The Poly Board determined that it supported the Third HP Proposal and directed the representatives of Morgan
Stanley to inform both of HP’s financial advisers of that support, subject to negotiation of the merger agreement. The representatives of Morgan Stanley
subsequently informed representatives of HP of the Poly Board’s determination.
Following the Poly Board meeting on January 18, 2022, HP and its advisers were granted access to an electronic data room that contained legal and
operational due diligence documents and information to support their due diligence review of Poly. Thereafter, members of HP management and
representatives of HP’s advisers conducted additional operational, legal, financial, accounting, employment and other due diligence on Poly. At various
points, members of HP management and representatives of HP (including HP’s legal and financial advisers) met with Poly management and our advisers to
discuss due diligence information, including in connection with HP’s assessment of potential synergies and current and prospective employee retention
and related matters.
On January 20, 2022, representatives of Party A informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Party A was no longer considering an acquisition
of us. Prior to this, we had continued to make due diligence information available to Party A.
On January 24, 2022, representatives of Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of Poly, provided representatives of HP and its legal advisers with a revised draft
of the merger agreement. Thereafter, Poly management and HP management, and representatives of their respective legal advisers, negotiated the terms of
the merger agreement. Key terms of the merger agreement negotiated by the parties included (1) the nature and scope of HP’s obligations to secure
necessary regulatory approvals for the acquisition; (2) the circumstances in which the Poly Board could evaluate and accept a “superior proposal” and in
which a termination fee would be payable by us to HP; (3) the definition of “material adverse effect”; (4) the conditions to each party’s obligation to
consummate the merger and each party’s right to terminate the merger agreement; (5) the nature and scope of the interim operating covenants applicable
to Poly during the period prior to the closing of the merger; and (6) Poly’s representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement.
On January 26, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley (1) discussed the ongoing due diligence review by HP; and (2) Party A’s decision not to
further consider an acquisition of us. The Strategic Committee discussed strategic acquirers other than Party A and Party B that it could contact
regarding their interest in an acquisition of us. The Strategic Committee also discussed whether to contact any potential financial acquirers. The Strategic
Committee determined that any contact with other strategic or financial acquirers was unlikely to lead to a transaction that would be as favorable to us as
a transaction with HP, and that such contact carried significant risk to us. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the terms of the draft merger
agreement. The Strategic Committee reminded Poly management that it should not discuss the terms of any employment arrangements with HP following
the potential acquisition until approved to do so by the Strategic Committee and after the key terms of the merger agreement had been determined. The
members of Poly management confirmed that no such discussions had occurred.
As of January 27, 2022, the confidentiality agreement between Poly and HP was amended to extend the term of the agreement and include
restrictions on HP’s ability to solicit the employment of our key employees. This amendment did not include a “standstill” or other restriction on HP’s
ability to make public or private proposals to acquire us.

On January 31, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the ongoing due diligence by HP, including HP’s requests for additional
information related to the following items, both of which HP identified as concerns: (1) ongoing supply chain challenges impacting Poly; and (2) employee
attrition at Poly. The possibility that HP might seek to lower the acquisition price was also discussed.
On February 2, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the ongoing due diligence by HP and the areas of HP’s diligence focus.
On February 3, 2022, Mr. Shull spoke with Enrique Lores, the president and chief executive officer of HP, and Mr. Cho. During this conversation,
Messrs. Lores and Cho described additional due diligence that HP needed to undertake before it could proceed with an acquisition of us.
Later on February 3, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and
Morgan Stanley in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the additional due diligence to be undertaken by HP.
On February 4, 2022, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in
attendance. The Poly Board discussed the additional due diligence to be undertaken by HP and agreed to allow HP to proceed. Thereafter, members of
each of Poly management and HP management and their respective advisers continued to meet regularly to discuss due diligence matters.
On February 8, 2022, Poly reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, which results noted supply chain constraints driving
increased backlog across all product categories. For the quarter, Poly reported revenue of $410 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $47 million, which were
below (1) Wall Street Research consensus estimates of $419 million and $52 million, respectively, and (2) the estimates included in the Credit Case and the
Field Case for the quarter as a result of in each case, among other things, continuing supply chain uncertainties.
On February 15, 2022, Mr. Shull spoke with Mr. Cho. During this conversation, Mr. Cho emphasized HP’s need to continue due diligence with
respect to (1) ongoing supply chain challenges impacting Poly; and (2) evolving challenges to Poly’s employee retention.
On February 16, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan
Stanley in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the status of HP’s due diligence work.
On or about March 9, 2022, Mr. Shull spoke with Mr. Cho. During this conversation, Mr. Cho expressed his support for an acquisition of us by HP,
but again noted HP’s concerns regarding (1) ongoing supply chain challenges impacting Poly; and (2) employee attrition at Poly.
On March 15, 2022, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in
attendance. The Poly Board discussed the status of HP’s due diligence work and the acquisition more generally.
On March 16, 2022, representatives of HP informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that HP was lowering the price in the proposed acquisition
to $35.00 in cash per share of our common stock. We refer to this as the “Fourth HP Proposal.” In support of this decision, the representatives of HP cited
(1) certain general factors, including recent volatility in the stock market and adverse and worsening macroeconomic and geopolitical developments; and
(2) certain Poly specific factors, including HP’s concerns with (a) ongoing supply chain challenges impacting Poly and (b) employee attrition at Poly. In
response, the representatives of Morgan Stanley stated their view that it was unlikely that there would be any support at the Poly Board for a transaction
at the price level contemplated by the Fourth HP Proposal.

Later on March 16, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and
Morgan Stanley in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the Fourth HP Proposal. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the Fourth
HP Proposal from a financial point of view. The Strategic Committee discussed a variety of responses to HP, including the possibility of discontinuing
acquisition discussions. The Strategic Committee determined to reject the Fourth HP Proposal and instructed the representatives of Morgan Stanley to
inform representatives of HP of that decision. The representatives of Morgan Stanley subsequently did so.
On March 18, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with representatives of HP about the status of the acquisition. The representatives of
HP said that HP was still considering how, if at all, to respond to the Strategic Committee’s rejection of the Fourth HP Proposal and also reiterated HP’s
concerns previously communicated in connection with the submission of the Fourth HP Proposal.
On March 21, 2022, both of HP’s financial advisers informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that HP was increasing the price in the proposed
acquisition to $38.75 in cash per share of our common stock. We refer to this as the “Fifth HP Proposal.” In response, the representatives of Morgan
Stanley stated their view that it was unlikely that there would be support at the Poly Board for a transaction at the price level contemplated by the Fifth
HP Proposal.
Later on March 21, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and
Morgan Stanley in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the Fifth HP Proposal. The Strategic Committee determined that it did not support the
Fifth HP Proposal. The Strategic Committee discussed a variety of responses to HP (including the possibility of discontinuing acquisition discussions),
and determined to seek input from the Poly Board related to the terms of a potential counterproposal (including as to whether to make a counterproposal
at all).
On March 22, 2022, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in
attendance. The Poly Board discussed the Fifth HP Proposal. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the Fifth HP Proposal from a financial
point of view based on information provided by Poly’s management, including the Credit Case and the Field Case, and publicly available information,
including the Street Case. Members of Poly management provided an update on (1) our financial and operating results, including with respect to ongoing
supply chain challenges and other industry conditions that presented risks to achieving some or all of the results implied by the Prospective Unaudited
Financial Information; and (2) investor sentiment. After discussion and the failure to reach consensus, the Poly Board instructed Mr. Hagerty to meet
with Mr. Lores to discuss the acquisition, including to inform Mr. Lores of the lack of consensus among the members of the Poly Board as to how, if at all,
to proceed in the light of the terms of the Fifth HP Proposal.
Later on March 22, 2022, Messrs. Hagerty and Lores spoke. During this conversation, Mr. Lores offered to increase the price in the acquisition to
$40.00 in cash per share of our common stock. We refer to this as the “Final HP Proposal.” Mr. Hagerty inquired as to whether Mr. Lores would consider
a higher price per share, to which Mr. Lores responded that the Final HP Proposal was HP’s best and final offer.
On March 23, 2022, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in
attendance. Mr. Hagerty described his conversation with Mr. Lores and reviewed the terms of the Final HP Proposal. Mr. Hagerty informed the Poly Board
that Mr. Lores had characterized the Final HP Proposal as HP’s best and final offer. The representatives of Morgan Stanley noted that both of HP’s
financial advisers had conveyed the same message to Morgan Stanley. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the Final HP Proposal from a
financial point of view based on information provided by Poly’s management, including the Credit Case and the Field Case, and publicly available
information, including the Street Case. The members of Poly management reminded the Poly Board of the considerations related to the Credit Case and
the Field Case first discussed at the meeting of the Strategic Committee on December 3, 2021. As part of this discussion, the members of Poly
management (1) stated that the Credit Case continued to
45
Table of Contents
represent a more conservative view of Poly’s future financial and operating results; and (2) described their evolving views on the achievability of the
financial and operating results implied by the Field Case given ongoing supply chain challenges. Following a review of the Credit Case and the Field
Case, as well as the uncertainty regarding current and future supply chain challenges and other related market and industry disruptions facing us, the
Poly Board again did not adopt either the Credit Case or the Field Case as the single best predictor of our future financial and operating results. Rather,
the Poly Board noted that each director, and the members of Poly management, had different perspectives on the Credit Case and the Field Case and the
risks to achieving the financial results implied by both cases, and that the Credit Case and the Field Case represented reasonable alternative estimates of
our future financial results in the light of the uncertainty facing us. The Poly Board did not conclude that either the Credit Case or the Field Case was
more likely to be achieved than the other, and reiterated its authorization for Morgan Stanley to use both cases in connection with its financial analyses
with no relative prioritization or weight attributed to one over the other. The Poly Board expressed its support for the Final HP Proposal and instructed the
representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley to work toward finalizing the merger agreement and the related disclosure letter.
On March 25, 2022, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in
attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Poly Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Wilson
Sonsini also reviewed the principal terms of the merger agreement. The representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis
of the Final HP Proposal of $40.00 in cash per share of Poly common stock to be received by the holders of shares of Poly common stock (other than as
specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement. Morgan Stanley then rendered to the Poly Board its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, that, as of March 25, 2022, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, $40.00 in cash per share of Poly
common stock to be received by the holders of shares of Poly common stock (other than cancelled shares and appraisal shares) pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Poly common stock, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.” Prior to this Poly Board meeting, Morgan Stanley
provided customary disclosures regarding Morgan Stanley’s relationships with HP and its affiliates. The Poly Board, after considering the reasons and
factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Recommendation of the Poly Board and the Reasons for the Merger,” (1)
determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were fair to, advisable and in the best
interests of Poly and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. Poly and HP subsequently signed the merger agreement.
Early on March 28, 2022, before the opening of trading on the NYSE, we publicly disclosed our entry into the merger agreement.
Recommendation of the Poly Board and Reasons for the Merger
Recommendation of the Poly Board
The Poly Board: (1) approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
approved the execution and performance of the merger agreement, and (2) determined that the terms of the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Poly and its stockholders.
The Poly Board recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the compensation that will or may
become payable by Poly to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting, from
time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate as determined in good faith by the Poly Board, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.

Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Poly Board consulted with Poly management, as well as representatives of each of Wilson
Sonsini and Morgan Stanley. In recommending that Poly stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, the Poly Board considered and
analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based on these
consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Poly Board concluded that entering into the merger agreement was
advisable and in the best interests of Poly and our stockholders.
The Poly Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and recommendation:
•
Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Prospects of Poly; Risks of Execution. The current, historical and projected financial
condition, results of operations and business of Poly, as well as Poly’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In
particular, the Poly Board considered Poly’s current business plan (as reflected in the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information). As part
of this, the Poly Board considered the current business plan and the potential opportunities and risks that it presented against, among other
things, various execution and other risks to achieving the plan and related uncertainties, including: (1) the impact of market, customer and
competitive trends on Poly; and (2) the general risks related to market conditions that could reduce the price of our common stock. Among
the potential risks identified by the Poly Board were:
•
Ongoing (and potentially worsening) disruptions in Poly’s supply chain, including the inability of our manufacturing facilities and
those of our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, suppliers and sub-suppliers to provide or timely deliver sufficient
quantities of key component parts or finished products. The Poly Board was aware that these disruptions have substantially
impacted our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis. These disruptions have negatively
impacted Poly’s revenues, reduced our profit margins and potentially harmed relationships with affected customers. The Poly Board
noted that it could not predict when these disruptions would normalize or that they would be resolved in the near term. The Poly
Board also noted that these disruptions could get worse due to many factors, including geopolitical circumstances, market forces and
competitive dynamics.
•
Poly’s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among these risks were consideration of (1)
Poly’s size, as well as its financial resources, relative to those of its competitors; (2) new and evolving competitive threats as other
large players potentially enter the market; (3) the substantial risks to achieving Poly’s business plan; and (4) the constraints placed on
Poly’s expansion opportunities given its substantial debt load and the related need to refinance that debt in the relatively short term.
•
The continued business and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility that business conditions—
for Poly and the larger economy—will not improve and could get worse.
•
The challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly traded company, which is subject to
scrutiny based on its quarter-over-quarter performance. The Poly Board was aware that the price of our common stock could be
negatively impacted if Poly failed to meet investor expectations, including if Poly failed to meet its growth objectives.
•
The historical execution track record of Poly’s business plan by Poly management and their ability to continue to drive Poly’s
business.
•
Potential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Poly Board that none of the possible alternatives to the merger (including
continuing to operate Poly as an independent company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of those
alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to Poly’s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing and
47
Table of Contents
likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for Poly to create greater value for our
stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business, financial, industry, competitive and regulatory risks. In this regard, the
Poly Board considered the fact that neither Party A nor Party B submitted a proposal to acquire Poly. In addition, the Poly Board considered
that the merger was the result of a strategic review process overseen by the Strategic Committee with the assistance of its independent legal
and financial advisors.
•
Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty
of value measured against the ongoing business and financial execution risks of Poly’s business plan, and allows our stockholders to realize
that value immediately upon the closing of the merger. In that regard, the Poly Board noted that Poly’s stock price could be negatively
impacted if we failed to meet investor expectations, and that the amount of cash to be received for each outstanding share of Poly common
stock is fixed and will not be reduced if the share price of Poly common stock declines prior to the effective time of the merger.
•
Best Value Reasonably Obtainable. The per share price was the result of extensive negotiation between the parties overseen by the
Strategic Committee composed of independent members of the Poly Board. The Poly Board believed that the per share price represented the
best value that Poly could reasonably obtain from HP for the shares of our common stock, taking into account the Poly Board’s familiarity
with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Poly on a historical and
prospective basis. In addition, the Poly Board believed that, measured against the longer-term execution risks described above, the per
share price reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of our common stock. The Poly Board also considered that the per share price
constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 47 percent to the closing price of our common stock on March 24, 2022; and (2) a premium of
approximately 47 percent to Poly’s 30-trading day average closing stock price ending on March 24, 2022.
•
Fairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley. The oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Poly Board, subsequently confirmed in writing,
that, as of March 25, 2022, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share
consideration to be received by our stockholders (other than the holders of the cancelled shares and appraisal shares) pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC” and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement.
•
Negotiations with HP and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement, which was the product of arms’-length
negotiations, and the belief of the Poly Board that the merger agreement contained terms and conditions that provided the Poly Board with
a high level of closing certainty. The factors considered included:
•
Poly’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties submitting
unsolicited takeover proposals.
•
The Poly Board’s belief that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third parties from making a superior
proposal.
•
The Poly Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement.
•
The Poly Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition
agreement. In that regard, the Poly Board believed that the termination fee payable by Poly in such instance was reasonable,
consistent with or below similar fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.
48
Table of Contents
•
The antitrust efforts that HP was willing to commit to in the merger agreement, making the merger reasonably likely to be
consummated.
•
The agreement by Poly and HP to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to consummate the merger,
including (1) obtaining all necessary or advisable waivers, consents and approvals and (2) defending any lawsuits challenging the
merger agreement.
•
The limited conditions to HP’s obligation to consummate the merger, making the merger reasonably likely to be consummated.
•
The consummation of the merger not being subject to a financing condition. In addition, HP represented in the merger agreement that
it will have sufficient funds to consummate the merger.
•
Reasonable Likelihood of Consummation. The belief of the Poly Board that an acquisition by HP has a reasonable likelihood of closing.
•
No HP Stockholder Vote. The fact that the consummation of the merger is not subject to the approval of HP’s stockholders.
•
Business Reputation of HP. The business reputation and financial resources of HP, and its long track record of completing acquisitions.
•
Appraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to our stockholders who timely and properly exercise such
appraisal rights under the DGCL if certain conditions are met.
The Poly Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors, including the following:
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash transaction means that our stockholders
will not participate in Poly’s future earnings or growth and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation. The
Poly Board considered the other potential alternative strategies available to Poly as an independent company, which, despite significant
uncertainty, had the potential to result in a more successful and valuable company.
•
No-Shop Restrictions. The restrictions in the merger agreement on Poly’s ability to solicit competing transactions (subject to certain
exceptions to allow the Poly Board to exercise its fiduciary duties and to accept a superior proposal, and then only upon the payment of a
termination fee).
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and if it is not
consummated, that: (1) Poly’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have
experienced significant distractions from their work on behalf of Poly during the pendency of the merger; (2) Poly will have incurred
significant transaction and other costs; (3) Poly’s continuing business relationships with customers, business partners and employees may
be adversely affected; (4) the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected; (5) the contractual and legal remedies
available to Poly in the event of the termination of the merger agreement may be insufficient, costly to pursue or both; and (6) the failure of
the merger to be consummated could result in an adverse perception among our customers, potential customers, employees and investors
about Poly’s prospects.
•
Regulatory Risks. The possibility that regulatory agencies may delay, object to or challenge the merger or may seek to impose terms and
conditions on their approvals that are not acceptable to HP.
•
Impact of Interim Restrictions on Poly’s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The restrictions on the conduct of Poly’s
business prior to the consummation of the merger, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking strategic initiatives before the
completion of the merger that, absent the merger agreement, we might have pursued.
•
Effects of the Merger Announcement. The effects of the public announcement of the merger, including the: (1) effects on our employees,
customers, operating results and stock price; (2) impact on our ability
49
Table of Contents
to attract and retain key management, sales and marketing, and technical personnel; and (3) potential for litigation in connection with the
merger.
•
Termination Fee Payable by Poly. The requirement that Poly pay HP a termination fee under certain circumstances following termination of
the merger agreement, including if the Poly Board terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal. The Poly Board
considered the potentially discouraging impact that this termination fee could have on a third party’s interest in making a competing
proposal to acquire Poly.
•
Taxable Consideration. The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes for many Poly stockholders.
•
Interests of Poly’s Directors and Executive Officers. The interests that Poly’s directors and executive officers may have in the merger, which
may be different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.
This discussion is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it summarizes the material reasons and factors evaluated by the Poly Board in its
consideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the Poly Board concluded that the potential benefits of entering into the merger
agreement outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In the light of the variety of factors considered by the Poly Board and the complexity of these factors,
the Poly Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights, ranks or values to the foregoing factors in
reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Poly Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the
process and may have assigned different relative weights, ranks or values to the different factors. The Poly Board adopted and approved the merger
agreement and the merger, and recommended that Poly stockholders adopt the merger agreement, based upon the totality of the information presented to,
and considered by, the Poly Board.
Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Poly retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and an opinion in connection with the possible sale of Poly. The Poly
Board selected Morgan Stanley to act as Poly’s financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, extensive expertise and international
reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in Poly’s industry, and its knowledge of Poly’s business and affairs. At the meeting
of the Poly Board on March 25, 2022, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of March 25, 2022, and based
upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the per share consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our common
stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares
of our common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of March 25, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its
opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The summary of the
opinion of Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read
Morgan Stanley’s opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was directed to the Poly Board, in its capacity as such, and addresses
only the fairness from a financial point of view of the per share consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our common stock (other than as
specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion and does not address the relative merits of the
merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are
available. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how our stockholders should vote at the special meeting.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Poly;
•
reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Poly;
•
reviewed certain financial projections for calendar years 2022 through 2024 prepared by the management of Poly and certain extrapolations
for calendar years 2025 through 2031 prepared by Morgan Stanley with guidance from Poly management (which were reviewed and
approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by Poly management) (which we refer to collectively as the “financial projections” for the purposes of
this section; see also the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Prospective Unaudited Financial Information”);
•
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Poly with senior executives of Poly;
•
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for our common stock;
•
compared the financial performance of Poly and the prices and trading activity of our common stock with that of certain other publicly
traded companies comparable with Poly and their securities;
•
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;

•
reviewed a substantially final draft of the merger agreement, dated March 25, 2022 and certain related documents; and
•

In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by Poly and formed a substantial basis for its opinion.
With respect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of Poly’s management of the future financial performance of Poly. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to the
financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be consummated in
accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other
things, that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley on March 25,
2022. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a
financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Poly and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to
legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative
business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion
with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Poly’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,
relative to the per share consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our common stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) in
the merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Poly, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished
with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect
on, and the information made
51
Table of Contents
available to Morgan Stanley as of, March 25, 2022. Events occurring after March 25, 2022, may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions
used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion as of March 25, 2022,
subsequently confirmed in writing as of such date, to the Poly Board. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion
or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described
represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in
tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must
be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied upon (1) the Field Case, (2)
the Credit Case and (3) the average of estimates by equity research analysts as of March 24, 2022 (which we refer to as the “Street Case”), each of which
included extrapolations through calendar year 2031 prepared by Morgan Stanley, which were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by Poly’s
management. The financial projections are more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Prospective Unaudited
Financial Information.” In accordance with direction from the Poly Board, Morgan Stanley utilized the Field Case, Credit Case and Street Case in its
financial analyses described below, and no relative prioritization or weight was attributed to any one of the financial projections.
Public Trading Comparables Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to
similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for Poly with comparable publicly available
consensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share similar
business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue
growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the “comparable
companies”). These companies were the following:
Cisco Systems, Inc.
Dell Technologies Inc.
Garmin Ltd.
GN Store Nord A/S
GoPro, Inc.
HP Inc.
Logitech International S.A.
Universal Electronics Inc.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value (which we refer to as “A
V”) for each of the comparable
companies utilizing publicly available financial information as of March 24, 2022 to estimated EBITDA for each of calendar years 2022 (which is referred to
as “CY22”) and 2023 (which we refer to as “CY23”). Morgan Stanley referred to these ratios as AV/CY2022E EBITDA and AV/CY2023E
52
Table of Contents
EBITDA, respectively. For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined “aggregate value” as a company’s fully diluted equity value plus total debt,
less cash and cash equivalents and “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.
Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and
experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of AV/CY2022E EBITDA of 8.0x – 11.0x and AV/CY2023E EBITDA of 7.0x – 10.0x and applied
these ranges to the estimated EBITDA for Poly for calendar years 2022 and 2023 based on each of the Street Case, Credit Case and the Field Case.
Based on the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Poly management on March 23, 2022 and the latest
cash and debt balances of Poly as provided by Poly management, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of our common stock
as follows:

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Poly. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond Poly’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Poly’s business and the industry generally,
industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Poly and the industry, and in the financial
markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company
data.
Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a theoretical estimate of the potential
future equity value of a company’s common stock as a function of such company’s estimated future EBITDA and a range of trading multiples. The
resulting estimated future implied equity value is subsequently discounted back to the present day to arrive at an illustrative estimate of the present value
for the company’s theoretical future implied stock price. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity
values per share of our common stock on a standalone basis for each of the Street Case, Credit Case and Field Case.
Morgan Stanley calculated ranges of implied equity values per share of our common stock as of March 24, 2022. To calculate the discounted equity
value per share of our common stock, Morgan Stanley used calendar year 2024 estimated EBITDA based on each of the Street Case, Credit Case and Field
Case. For each scenario, Morgan Stanley calculated the future-implied fully diluted equity value of Poly as of March 24, 2022 by applying its public
trading comparables analysis reference ranges for AV/CY2022E EBITDA of 8.0x – 11.0x, based on each of the Street Case, Credit Case and Field Case, to
Poly’s calendar year 2024 estimated EBITDA. In each
53
Table of Contents
case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future-implied fully diluted equity value by estimated future diluted shares outstanding (with such estimates
provided by Poly’s management) to calculate a future equity value per share. Morgan Stanley discounted the resulting future equity values per share to
March 24, 2022 using a discount rate equal to Poly’s assumed cost of equity of 13.1 percent, which cost of equity was selected by applying the capital
asset pricing model and based on the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. Based on these calculations, this analysis
implied the following value ranges per share of our common stock:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present
value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share
for our common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value Poly as a stand-alone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the Street
Case, Credit Case and Field Case for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, less (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) taxes, (3) capital expenditures, and (4) plus or minus changes in net working capital, which
estimated unlevered free cash flow was reviewed and approved by Poly management for Morgan Stanley’s use. Each of the Street Case, Credit Case and
Field Case included extrapolations through calendar year 2031 prepared by Morgan Stanley that were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use
by Poly’s management. The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a midyear convention, to present values as of March 24, 2022, at a
discount rate ranging from 8.3 percent to 9.2 percent, which discount rates were selected upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment
and experience, to reflect an estimate of Poly’s weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the capital asset pricing model. Morgan
Stanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 0.0 percent to 2.0 percent as part of its analyses, with such rates were selected upon the application of Morgan
Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. Morgan Stanley then deducted net debt of Poly to the value of the discounted unlevered free cash flow
and terminal value to derive the implied equity value.
Based on the outstanding shares of Poly common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Poly’s management on March 23, 2022, Morgan
Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of our common stock as follows:

Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly
available financial terms, by reviewing publicly available statistics for selected comparable transactions. Such comparable transactions were selected
because they shared certain characteristics with the merger, most notably because they were similar hardware transactions. For each such transaction,

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable transactions and upon the application of its professional judgment and
experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges for the ratio of aggregate value to the estimated NTM EBITDA of 8.0x to 12.0x and applied
these ranges to Poly’s estimated NTM EBITDA as of March 24, 2022, based on the Street Case to calculate a range of implied equity values per share of
our common stock. The results of the analysis were as follows:

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Poly or the merger. In evaluating the precedent
transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Poly’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Poly’s
business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Poly
and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and fully
diluted equity value of the

transactions to which the merger is being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of Poly derived from the
valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the per share price in connection with the merger is not necessarily dispositive in
connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the merger, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.
Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but
which were noted as reference data for the Poly Board.
Illustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums
Morgan Stanley reviewed the premiums paid by acquirers in selected public company technology transactions occurring between 2011 and March
24, 2022, with aggregate values greater than $250 million. Morgan Stanley selected such public company technology transactions because of certain
shared characteristics with the merger based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. For each transaction in the analyses, Morgan
Stanley noted, where available: (1) the implied premium to the acquired company’s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or,
as applicable, on the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); (2) the implied premium
to the acquired company’s 30-day average closing share price prior to announcement (or, as applicable, the last trading day prior to the share price being
affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); and (3) the implied premium to the acquired company’s 52-week high closing share price
prior to announcement (or, as applicable, the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news).
Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan
Stanley selected (1) a representative range of premia and applied such range to Poly’s closing share price on March 24, 2022; (2) a representative range of
premia and applied such range to Poly’s closing share price during the 30 trading days prior to and including March 24, 2022; and (3) a representative
range of premia and applied such range to Poly’s closing share price during the 52-week period prior to and including March 24, 2022.

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets
Morgan Stanley reviewed publicly available equity research analysts’ share price targets for our common stock as of March 24, 2022. Morgan
Stanley used the lowest and highest undiscounted price targets issued by those research analysts with publicly available price targets for shares of Poly,
resulting in a range of $28 to $55 per share of our common stock, with a median of $33.00 per share.
Morgan Stanley then calculated the range of discounted price targets for Poly by discounting such targets for one year. Based on an estimated
cost of equity of 13.1 percent for Poly, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of discounted price targets of $25 to $49 per share of our common stock, with a
median of $29 per share.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for our
common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of Poly and future financial market conditions.
General
In connection with the review of the merger by the Poly Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of an opinion is a complex process and not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to
any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole,
would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and
factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions.
As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of the
actual value of Poly.
In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous judgments and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Poly’s control. These include, among other things,
the impact of competition on Poly’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial
condition and prospects of Poly and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not
necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the per share
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Poly common stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to the merger
agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of March 25, 2022, to the Poly Board. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or reflect the prices at which shares of our common stock might actually trade.
57
Table of Contents
The aggregate per share consideration to be received by the holders of shares of our common stock (other than as specified in the merger
agreement) pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Poly and HP and was approved by the Poly
Board. Morgan Stanley provided financial advice to the Poly Board during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific
consideration to Poly or the Poly Board, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for
the merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other
alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not,
constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how our stockholders should vote at the special meeting.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Poly Board were among the many factors taken into consideration by the Poly Board to
recommend that the Poly Board approve and adopt the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as
determinative of the opinion of the Poly Board with respect to the consideration pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Poly Board would
have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking
and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.
The Poly Board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global
financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is
engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, and prime brokerage, as well
as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on
a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect
transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Poly, HP, and their respective affiliates, or
any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Poly Board financial advisory services and an opinion, described in this
section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the merger, and Poly has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of
approximately $36 million for its services, $7 million of which was paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to this
proxy statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Poly has also agreed to reimburse Morgan
Stanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Poly
has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any,
controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in
connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing services to Poly and have
received aggregate fees of approximately $2 million to $5 million in connection with such services. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s
opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financing services to HP and have received aggregate fees of approximately $2 million to $5
million in connection with such services and have acted as a lender to HP. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing
services to Poly, HP and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services. Additionally, Judith
Miscik, a director of HP, is a member of the Morgan Stanley board of directors. As a director of Morgan Stanley, Ms. Miscik has not had involvement with
the execution of Morgan Stanley’s engagement as financial advisor to Poly.

PLANTRONICS INC CA_20220517_DEFM14A_20103137_4464750.Pdf,Prospective Unaudited Financial Information,"Prospective Unaudited Financial Information
Other than in connection with our regular earnings press releases and related investor materials, we do not, as a matter of course, make public
projections as to our long-term future financial performance, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the
underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Poly management regularly prepares projections as to our future financial performance for internal use.
In connection with our strategic planning process and evaluation of strategic alternatives (including continuing as an independent company), Poly
management prepared and provided to the Poly Board various unaudited forward-looking financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (which
information was then calendarized). At the direction of the Poly Board, cash flows for calendar years 2025 through 2031 were extrapolated by Morgan
Stanley and approved by the Poly Board and Poly management for use by Morgan Stanley in connection with its financial analyses for the purpose of
rendering an opinion to the Poly Board (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.
LLC”).
The unaudited forward-looking financial information prepared by Poly management and provided to the Poly Board included:
•
A long-range plan that we refer to as the “Credit Case.” In preparing the Credit Case, Poly management used the following material
assumptions: (1) the continuation of supply constraints for fiscal year 2023 impacting revenue; (2) growth rates in fiscal year 2024 and fiscal
year 2025 that were consistent with industry analyst market growth rate assumptions; and (3) a negative impact to gross margin and
operating margin in fiscal year 2023 due to higher component and freight costs consistent with those experienced in fiscal year 2022, and
improvements to gross margin and operating margin thereafter as supply constraints and freight costs normalize.
•
A long-range plan that we refer to as the “Field Case.” In preparing the Field Case, Poly management used the following material
assumptions: (1) a still constrained but improved supply chain in fiscal year 2023; (2) growth rates in fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025
that were consistent with industry analyst market growth rate assumptions; and (3) a negative impact to gross margin and operating margin
in fiscal year 2023 due to higher component and freight costs consistent with those experienced in fiscal year 2022 but with some offset due
to lower-cost replacement parts, and improvements to gross margin and operating margin thereafter as supply constraints and freight costs
normalize.
This forward-looking information, including the Credit Case and the Field Case, is collectively referred to as the “Prospective Unaudited Financial
Information.”
At the direction of the Poly Board, the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information was used by Morgan Stanley in connection with its financial
analyses for the purpose of rendering an opinion to the Poly Board and no relative prioritization or weight was attributed to any Prospective Unaudited
Financial Information (as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”). A
summary of the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information is set forth below. A subset of the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information was
provided to HP.
The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information was prepared by, and is the sole responsibility of, Poly management. At Poly’s direction, Morgan
Stanley relied on the accuracy and completeness of the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information utilized in its financial analyses and advice to the
Poly Board, as well as the assurances of Poly management that (1) it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information
inaccurate or misleading; and (2) the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information was reasonably prepared based on the best currently available
estimates and judgments of Poly management of the future financial performance of Poly.
59Table of Contents
The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information was developed by Poly management without giving effect to the merger or to any changes to
Poly’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the merger. The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information also does
not consider the effect of any failure of the merger to be completed; it should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The
Prospective Unaudited Financial Information included in this proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Poly management.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying
Prospective Unaudited Financial Information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Poly’s previously issued
financial statements. It does not extend to the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information and should not be read to do so.
Poly management, using its business judgment, believed in good faith that the above assumptions were reasonable and, as a result of this belief,
the opinion of Poly management was that the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information (1) was prepared on a reasonable basis; (2) reflected the best
currently available estimates and judgments then available (taking into account the relevant information available to Poly management at that time); and
(3) presented, to Poly management’s knowledge, our expected future financial performance within the parameters and under the assumptions specified in
preparing the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information. Because the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information reflects estimates and judgments, it
is susceptible to sensitivities and assumptions, as well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The
Prospective Unaudited Financial Information also covers multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding
year. The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information is not, and should not be considered to be, a guarantee of future operating results. Further, the
Prospective Unaudited Financial Information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of Poly’s future results.
Although the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous assumptions and estimates
as to future events, including those detailed above, made by Poly management that Poly management believed in good faith were reasonable. The
Prospective Unaudited Financial Information will be affected by our ability to achieve our strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable
periods. The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Important
factors that may affect actual results and cause the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information not to be achieved include, among others, (1) general
economic conditions (including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic); (2) the accuracy of certain accounting assumptions; (3) changes in actual or
projected cash flows; (4) changes in tax laws; (5) competitive pressures, including new market entrants and changes in the competitive environment; (6)
disruptions in our supply chain, including the inability of our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers, original design
manufacturers, suppliers and sub-suppliers, to provide or timely deliver sufficient quantities of key component parts or finished products; (7) our ability
to attract, integrate and retain qualified personnel; and (8) our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products. Additional factors that may
impact us or our business can be found in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” and in the various risk factors
included in our periodic filings with the SEC. All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of our control. As a result, there can
be no assurance that the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or materially worse than
those contained in the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information. The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information may differ from publicized analyst
estimates and forecasts and does not consider any events or circumstances after the date that it was prepared, including the announcement of the entry
into the merger agreement. You should evaluate the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information, if at all, in conjunction with our historical financial
statements and
60
Table of Contents
other information regarding Poly contained in our public filings with the SEC. Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not
intend to update or otherwise revise the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information to reflect circumstances existing after the date that such information
was prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events.
Certain of the financial measures included in the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information, including EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow, are
“non-GAAP financial measures.” These are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (which we refer to as “GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP
financial measures, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations
inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation.
Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP.
Financial measures included in forecasts provided to a financial adviser and a board of directors in connection with a business combination
transaction, such as the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information, are excluded from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures” under
applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a result, the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information is not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of
non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure.
Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not provided to or relied upon by the Poly Board or Morgan Stanley. Accordingly, no
reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information is provided in this proxy statement.
The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information constitutes forward-looking statements. By including the Prospective Unaudited Financial
Information in this proxy statement, none of Poly, our financial adviser or any of our or our financial adviser’s representatives has made or makes any
representation to any person regarding our ultimate performance as compared to the information contained in the Prospective Unaudited Financial
Information. The inclusion of the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information should not be regarded as an indication that the Poly Board, Poly, our
financial adviser or any other recipient of the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information considered, or now considers, the Prospective Unaudited
Financial Information to be predictive of actual future results. For information on factors that may cause our future results to materially vary, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.” Further, the inclusion of the Prospective Unaudited Financial Information in
this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Poly that the information presented is material. The Prospective Unaudited
Financial Information is included in this proxy statement solely to give our stockholders access to the information that was made available to the Poly
Board and Morgan Stanley. The Prospective Unaudited Financial Information is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any Poly
stockholder as to how to vote at the special meeting with respect to the merger, or whether to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares.

When considering the recommendation of the Poly Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders.
In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that the merger
agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Poly Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among
other matters. These interests are more fully described below.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of Poly will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and insurance
coverage, including under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”

executive officers and of which none were held by our current non-employee directors. As of the same date, there were no outstanding awards of Poly
Interim PSUs.
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each share of Poly Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will vest in full and become free of restrictions as of the effective time of the merger and will be converted into the right to receive the
per share price under the same terms and conditions as apply to the receipt of the merger consideration by holders of Poly common stock generally.
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly RSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger agreement that are
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the
number of shares of Poly common stock subject to such Poly RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (B) the per share
price. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after the effective time
of the merger.
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly PSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger agreement that are
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A)
the total number of shares of Poly common stock subject to such Poly PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (calculated based on the
terms of the Poly equity plan and applicable award agreement governing such Poly PSU and based on actual performance against performance targets
with such performance determined as of five business days prior to the effective time of the merger) multiplied by (B) the per share price. This amount
(less any required withholdings and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger.
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly Interim RSUs that were granted on or after the date of the merger agreement and
prior to the effective time of the merger (including Poly Converted Interim RSUs) that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will be either (in the sole discretion of HP): (A) assumed by HP and converted into restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of HP common
stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of our common stock
subject to such Poly Interim RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the per share price by
(b) the average closing price per share of HP’s common stock on the NYSE for the ten trading-day period ending on the trading day preceding the closing
date of the merger, but subject to the vesting schedule that is applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the
merger and the other terms and conditions applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger; or (B) canceled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to such Poly Interim RSU
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (ii) the per share price, with such amount payable on the vesting schedule that is
applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger and otherwise subject to the other terms and conditions
applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger. For any consideration described in prior clause (A), HP will
issue the Poly Interim RSU Merger Consideration in the form of restricted stock units covering shares of HP’s common stock at or reasonably promptly
after the effective time of the merger, or for any consideration described in prior clause (B), the Poly Interim RSU Merger Consideration will be paid in
cash (less any required withholding and other taxes) according to the applicable vesting schedule, to each holder of Poly Interim RSUs with respect to
such holder’s Poly Interim RSUs.
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly Interim PSUs that were granted on or after the date of the merger agreement and
prior to the effective time of the merger that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be canceled and exchanged for a Poly
Converted Interim RSU with

Table of Contents
respect to a number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to such Poly Interim PSU with respect to
target performance and with the same remaining time-based vesting schedule that would have been applicable had the Poly Interim PSU been initially
granted as a Poly Interim RSU, and such award will be treated as a Poly Interim RSU as described above.
Treatment of Poly Options
As of April 15, 2022, there were no outstanding Poly options with an exercise price below the per share price. As of the same date, there were
outstanding Poly options to purchase an aggregate of 44,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price greater than or equal to the per share
price, of which none were held by our current non-employee directors or current executive officers.
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly options that have an exercise price per share of our common stock that is less than
the per share price, whether or not exercisable or vested, that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the excess of the per share price over the exercise price of such Poly option by
(B) the number of shares of our common stock subject to such Poly option. This amount (less any required withholdings and other taxes) will be paid to
the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger.
At or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly options that have an exercise price per share of our common stock that is equal to or
greater than the per share price, whether or not exercisable or vested, that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be canceled
without payment.
Treatment of the ESPP
The ESPP will be frozen and suspended at the end of the offering period that is in progress as of the date of the merger agreement and no new
offering periods will commence under the ESPP at any time on or after the date of the merger agreement. No current participants in the ESPP will be
permitted to increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions under the ESPP from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement or
make any separate non-payroll contribution to the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement. If any offering period that is in progress as of
the date of the merger agreement continues to be in progress as of the effective time of the merger, such offering period will be shortened in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP to a date on or prior to the closing date of the merger. The ESPP will terminate prior to, and contingent upon, the effective time
of the merger. Of our current executive officers, one currently participates in the ESPP. Our non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in the
ESPP.

RSUs and Poly PSUs that are scheduled to vest and be settled before June 15, 2022 (without regard to any change in control-related accelerated vesting). The amounts
shown are determined assuming that no individual will dispose of shares of our common stock from April 15, 2022, through June 14, 2022, and that the Poly Restricted
Stock, Poly RSUs and Poly PSUs scheduled to vest and be settled prior to June 15, 2022, are so settled. The number of shares shown does not include shares of our
common stock that the individual may purchase after June 14, 2022 under the ESPP. For additional information regarding the treatment of our ESPP in the merger, see

total number of shares of our common stock subject to Poly Restricted Stock, Poly RSUs or Poly PSUs (at target levels of achievement), as applicable. At maximum
levels of achievement, the number of shares of our common stock subject to Poly PSUs is 580,745 for Mr. Shull; 184,390 for Mr. Boynton; 80,884 for Ms.

with the closing of the merger (whom we refer to as “continuing employees”), including our current executive officers, if their employment continues
following the closing of the merger, will be entitled to certain compensation and benefits at levels specified in the merger agreement for a period of 12
months following the closing (or shorter period of employment). Such continued compensation and benefits will apply to all continuing employees
generally and are not specific to executive officers. For more information on compensation and benefits in respect of continuing employees following the

Table of Contents
Golden Parachute Compensation
The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding certain compensation for each of Poly’s named
executive officers that is based on, or that otherwise relates to, the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the
applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable to Poly’s named executive
officers. Poly’s “named executive officers” for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy statement are Messrs. Shull, Hagerty, Boynton, Wiese and Puorro
and Mses. Bodensteiner and Huser. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments quantified below, see the sections of this proxy statement
captioned “Interests of Poly’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards” and “Interests of Poly’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger—Severance Agreements.”
The amounts in the table are estimated using the following assumptions and such additional assumptions as may be set forth in the footnotes to
the table:
•
that the effective time of the merger will occur on June 15, 2022 (which is the assumed closing date of the merger solely for purposes of this
golden parachute compensation disclosure);
•
that the current named executive officers will have a qualifying termination of his or her employment at the effective time of the merger that
results in severance benefits becoming payable to him or her under the individual’s severance agreement without taking into account any
possible reduction that might be required to avoid the excise tax in connection with Section 280G under Section 4999 of the Code;
•
that the equity awards that are outstanding as of April 15, 2022 are the equity awards that Poly has granted to the named executive officer
through June 14, 2022; and
•
that the number of shares of our common stock subject to Poly PSUs will be determined at target levels of achievement.
The amounts reported below are estimates based on these and other assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant
date. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth
below. Poly’s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation or tax reimbursements in connection with the
merger. As required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value of our common stock have been calculated
based on the per share price.

The amounts set forth in the table above and below for each named executive officer represents the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which the named
executive officer may become entitled under the individual’s severance agreement if, during the 24 month period after the closing of the merger, a qualifying termination
occurs, and provided the individual signs and does not a revoke a release of claims with Poly. Such amounts will be paid in the form of a lump sum payment (less
applicable withholding taxes) and are equal to the following:
•
For David Shull, our president and chief executive officer, the sum of (1) 200 percent of Mr. Shull’s annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the
termination or (if greater) at the level in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger, plus (2) 200 percent of Mr. Shull’s target bonus as in effect for the

These amounts represent “single-trigger” cash payments in exchange for the cancellation of unvested Poly RSUs and Poly PSUs (at target levels of performance) at or
immediately prior to the effective time, which will occur automatically and without regard to whether or not the named executive officer’s employment is terminated, as
described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Poly’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-
Based Awards—Equity Interests of Poly’s Directors and Executive Officers.”
None of the named executive officers hold outstanding Poly options or Poly Restricted Stock.
With respect to Poly RSUs, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our common stock subject
to the Poly RSUs held by the named executive officer. Accordingly, the amount represents unvested Poly RSUs covering a total of 88,849 shares of our common stock
for Mr. Shull; 5,715 shares of our common stock for Mr. Hagerty; 23,659 shares of our common stock for Mr. Boynton; and 15,379 shares of our common stock for Ms.
Bodensteiner. Mr. Wiese does not hold Poly RSUs that will be outstanding as of June 14, 2022.
With respect to Poly PSUs, the amount is determined as the product of (i) the per share price, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our common stock subject
to the Poly PSUs held by the named executive officer assuming the applicable performance condition is satisfied at target levels of achievement. Accordingly, the
amount represents unvested Poly PSUs covering a total 173,982 shares of our common stock for Mr. Shull (increased to 580,745 shares of our common stock at
maximum levels of performance); 55,192 shares of our common stock for Mr. Boynton (increased to 184,390 shares of our common stock at maximum levels of
performance); and 24,218 shares of our common stock for Ms. Bodensteiner (increased to 80,884 shares of our common stock at maximum levels of performance). Mr.
Hagerty and Mr. Wiese do not hold Poly PSUs that will be outstanding as of June 14, 2022.

The amounts set forth in the table above for each named executive officer represents the “double-trigger” severance benefits to which the named executive officer may
become entitled upon a qualifying termination, provided the individual signs and does not a revoke a release of claims with Poly, and include the following:
•
For Messrs. Shull, Boynton and Wiese, a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the individual would be required to pay to
continue his group health coverage as in effect on the date of his termination for himself and his eligible dependents, multiplied by 24, which payment will be made
less applicable withholdings and regardless of whether the individual elects COBRA continuation coverage;
•
For Ms. Bodensteiner, if Ms. Bodensteiner elects continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA or Cal-COBRA for herself or her eligible dependents, reimbursement for
the COBRA (or, if applicable, the Cal-COBRA) premiums for such coverage for up to 24 months; and
•
For Mr. Shull, outplacement services for 24 months (valued at $30,000 for purposes of the table above) and for Ms. Bodensteiner, outplacement services for 12
months (valued at $15,000 for purposes of the table above).

Under the applicable severance agreement, amounts are subject to reduction in the event the named executive officer would receive a greater benefit on an after-tax basis
by having some of his or her change in control-related payments and benefits being cut back rather than paying the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code on such amounts. This amount assumes no such reduction is applied.

Mr. Hagerty served as Poly’s interim chief executive officer from February 7, 2020 through September 8, 2020. During that time he retained his chairman position.
Effective September 8, 2020, Mr. Shull was appointed president and chief executive officer and at that time, Poly resumed the separation of the roles of chairman and
chief executive officer.

On May 20, 2021, Poly announced the resignation of Mr. Puorro as Poly’s executive vice president, general manager, products to be effective June 15, 2021. Mr. Puorro
will not receive any benefits based on or otherwise relating to the merger.

On August 14, 2020, Poly announced the resignation of Ms. Huser as Poly’s executive vice president, chief legal and compliance officer and corporate secretary. Ms.
Huser will not receive any benefits based on or otherwise relating to the merger.
Employment Arrangements Following the Merger
As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Poly’s executive officers have (1) reached an understanding on potential employment or other
retention terms with the surviving corporation or with HP or Merger Sub; or (2) entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding
employment or other retention with the surviving corporation or with HP or Merger Sub to be effective following the consummation of the merger.
However, prior to the effective time of the merger, HP or Merger Sub may initiate discussions regarding employment or other retention terms and may
enter into definitive agreements regarding employment or retention for certain of Poly’s employees to be effective as of the effective time of the merger.",70,79

Appraisal Rights",79,79
PLANTRONICS INC CA_20220517_DEFM14A_20103137_4464750.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
General Information
If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, (2) properly demand an
appraisal of their applicable shares of our common stock prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement, (3) continuously hold their shares
through the effective time of the merger, (4) otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as “Section 262”),
including by satisfying certain ownership thresholds set forth therein, and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal
may, subject to the conditions of Section 262, seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262. Unless the context requires
otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” or to a “holder of shares” are to a record holder of our common stock.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the
full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following
summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders exercise their appraisal rights
under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A
person having a beneficial interest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee,
must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder’s shares. If you hold your shares of our common
71Table of Contents
stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other
nominee to ensure that appraisal rights are exercised. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262 as well as the information
discussed below.
Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares to Poly prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement; and (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger may be entitled to have their shares of our
common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of our common stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in
its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of
Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted
appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of our common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our
common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares
exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the
date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such
period (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving
corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days
prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and
include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Poly’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in
connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the merger, any holder of
shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex C
carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the
DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of our
common stock, Poly believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must do ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Poly a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting; and
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a
stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger).
72
Table of Contents
In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal
rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, each of
our stockholders who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain with
respect to such proposal.
Filing Written Demand
A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Poly, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special
meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. In addition, that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail
or via the Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written
demands for appraisal. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and
must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the merger. Neither voting (in person or by proxy) against the adoption of the
merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written
demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or
vote on the adoption of the merger agreement.
Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A
demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform
Poly of the identity of the holder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. If the shares are owned
of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the
record owner, and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be
executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for
appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the
demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If a stockholder holds shares of our common stock through a broker who in turn
holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on
behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN “STREET NAME” BY A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE AND WHO WISH
TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL
OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH
AS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN
A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

Table of Contents
At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant
to the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to Poly, as the surviving corporation, a written
withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger
will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will
be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as
the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration
within 60 days after the effective time of the merger. If Poly, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal
when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in
the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a
stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less
than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each record holder of shares of
our common stock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of our common stock
who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 (or a beneficial owner in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving
corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders
entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not
assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of our common stock.
Accordingly, any holders of shares of our common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights in respect of their shares of our common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If no petition for appraisal is
filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, stockholders’ rights to appraisal shall cease, and all
holders of shares of our common stock will be entitled to receive the consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement, without interest.
Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has complied with the requirements for an
appraisal of such holder’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Poly has received
demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must send this statement to the requesting
stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of
the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the
foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
74
Table of Contents
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation,
the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given
to the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be given by
one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,
Delaware or any other publication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving
corporation.
After notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may
require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder.
Pursuant to Section 262(g) of the DGCL, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who assert
appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as
measured in accordance with Section 262(g) of the DGCL or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million.
Determination of Fair Value
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair
value” of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into
account all relevant factors. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date
of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in
the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment
pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the
surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery; and (2) interest
accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors
that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are
generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously
requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of
fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be
“exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies
75
Table of Contents
only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that
“elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product
of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares
and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an
opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value
higher or lower than, or the same as, the per share price. Neither Poly nor HP anticipates offering more than the per share price to any stockholder
exercising appraisal rights, and each of Poly and HP reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and
to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of our common stock is less than the per share price.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value
of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly
withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of our common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of
the merger into the right to receive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement.
From and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 will be entitled to
vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger).
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. In
that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the merger agreement, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before
attempting to exercise those rights.

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the
merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to as the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the
Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in
effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to

change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to beneficial owners who hold their shares of our common
stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).
This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to beneficial owners in light
of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
•
tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as
financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or
pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in
securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate
investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; holders who hold their common stock as “qualified small business stock”
for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code; Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of our
common stock; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction
transaction;
•
tax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY
HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY TERRITORY, STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.

Table of Contents
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons
as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a
United States person.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount
that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s
holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to
long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses may be subject to limitations. If a U.S.
Holder acquired different blocks of shares of our common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis
and holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s ordinary method of accounting.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder
nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such
gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax
treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the completion of the
merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30
percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or
•
Poly is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer
to as “USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with
respect to the applicable shares of our common stock (which we refer to as the “relevant period”) and, if shares of our common stock are
regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns
(directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such
gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as
78
Table of Contents
described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair
market value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of its
worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property
interests generally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we
believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. Holders are
encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by a beneficial owner of our
common stock pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification
number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S.
Holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor
form); or (b) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.
A U.S. Holder may be required to retain records related to such holder’s common stock and file with its U.S. federal income tax return, for the taxable
year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the merger.
Withholding on Foreign Entities
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (which we refer to as
“FATCA”), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (as specially defined under
these rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the
U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of
such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a
U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a
certification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or
credits of such taxes.
The Treasury Department has released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of
30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S.
Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Beneficial owners of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the
disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.

Under the merger agreement, each of the parties agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
79Table of Contents
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable and in any case prior to the outside
date, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including:
•
the obtaining of all necessary or advisable actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from governmental authorities and the
making of all necessary or advisable registrations and filings as determined by HP (including filings with governmental authorities, if any)
after consultation and discussion with, and consideration in good faith of the views of, Poly, and the taking of all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any governmental authority;
•
the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties;
•
the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings through the outside date, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger
agreement or any other transaction agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other governmental authority vacated or reversed; and
•
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
and to fully carry out the purposes of the merger agreement and the other transaction agreements in accordance with the terms and subject
to the conditions thereof.
The items under the first two bullets above include approvals under, or notifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and the competition laws of China,
Colombia, the European Union and Mexico and the FDI law of France (which we collectively refer to as the “specified regulatory laws”), and may include
approvals under or pursuant to the competition laws of the United Kingdom, Australia and/or New Zealand if HP determines a filing, submission or
notification is advisable in such a jurisdiction or if regulators in such a jurisdiction open an investigation regarding the merger.
HSR Act; Foreign Competition Laws and Foreign Investment Laws
HSR Act
Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until HP and Poly file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission (which
we refer to as the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”), and the applicable waiting period has
expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting period
following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. The DOJ or the FTC may extend
the 30-day waiting period by issuing a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Materials (also known as a “Second Request”). If either
agency issues a Second Request, the waiting period is extended until 30 days after the parties substantially comply with the request. The parties filed a
notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on April 7, 2022. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration
of a 30-calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting
period. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 9, 2022.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the
DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and
contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
any state or the District of Columbia
80
Table of Contents
could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the
merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Poly or HP. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.
Foreign Competition Laws and Foreign Investment Laws
Under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until all consents, approvals and filings required under the specified foreign
regulatory laws (which includes certain foreign antitrust laws and Articles L. 151-3 to L. 151-7 and R. 151-1 to R. 151-17 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code (which we refer to as the “French FDI Law”)) have been obtained or deemed to have been obtained. The parties must observe mandatory
waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances or consents in each of the following required foreign jurisdictions as promptly as
practicable before completing the merger:
China. Under the Antimonopoly Law of 2007, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue levels cannot be completed until
they are reviewed and approved by the State Administration for Market Regulation (which we refer to as “SAMR”). HP and Poly have sufficient revenues
to exceed SAMR’s statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the merger is therefore conditioned upon SAMR approval. HP and Poly submitted a
simplified notification form to SAMR on April 8, 2022. The filing was formally accepted by SAMR under the simplified procedure on May 9, 2022, upon
which date a 30-day Phase I review period commenced.
European Union. Both HP and Poly conduct business across the European Union in multiple member states. Under the Council Regulation (EC)
No. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (which we refer to as the “EU Merger Regulation”) the
merger cannot be completed until the merger is notified to the European Commission. The parties must wait to implement the merger until after the
European Commission has issued a decision declaring the merger compatible with the common market (and/or if the European Commission has referred
any aspect of the merger to one or more competent authorities of a European Union member state under Article 9 of the EU Merger Regulation or an
EFTA state under Article 6 of Protocol 24 to the EEA Agreement, until each competent authority has issued a clearance or a confirmation that the merger
may proceed). As is customary, HP and Poly are in prenotification consultations with the European Commission and intend to file formally as soon as is
reasonably practicable.
France. Poly has a French subsidiary and conducts business activities in France through an indirectly wholly owned branch. Through its Dutch
entity, Poly sells indirectly, via independent distributors and resellers and directly to certain large customers, certain Poly products and provides
maintenance and cloud services to customers who may be involved in sensitive or strategic activities in France. Under the French FDI Law, the
acquisition of control over a French company by a foreign investor where the company’s activities in France are deemed sensitive requires prior
authorization from the French Minister of Economy. Non-compliance with the French FDI Law can trigger significant sanctions, including the blocking or
authorization from the French Minister of Economy. Non-compliance with the French FDI Law can trigger significant sanctions, including the blocking or
reversal of the proposed transaction in France and large fines. While there are reasonable arguments that Poly’s activities do not constitute sensitive
activities under the French FDI Law, HP and Poly view it as advisable to proceed with a foreign investment filing in France to either obtain (1)
confirmation from the French authorities that Poly’s French activities are out of scope; or (2) prior approval from the French Minister of Economy should
the French authorities consider that the transaction is within the scope of the French FDI Law. HP and Poly therefore intend to submit a filing to the
French Minister of Economy as soon as is reasonably practicable.
Colombia. In Colombia under Law 1340 of 2009, transactions involving parties with combined sales or assets above certain revenue levels cannot
be completed until they are reviewed and approved by the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (which we refer to as “SIC”). HP and Poly intend
to submit a notice to SIC as soon as is reasonably practicable.
Mexico. In Mexico under the Federal Law on Economic Competition of 2014, transactions involving parties with assets located in Mexico or annual
volumes of sales originating in Mexico, which jointly or separately
81
Table of Contents
exceed certain thresholds, cannot be completed until they are reviewed and approved by the Federal Commission on Economic Competition (which we
refer to as “COFECE”). HP and Poly intend to submit a notification to COFECE as soon as is reasonably practicable.
The merger agreement also specifies that the parties may make additional filings that, in the view of HP after consultation and discussion with, and
consideration in good faith of the views of, Poly, are required or advisable pursuant to any other foreign regulatory law (which include foreign antitrust
and FDI laws), though obtaining consents or approvals in connection with these additional filings is not, and does not become, a set of closing
conditions for the merger.
In any of these foreign jurisdictions, the relevant competition and FDI reviewing authorities could take such actions under applicable competition
laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold
separate, assets or to terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions
could jeopardize or delay the completion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of the merger. There is no assurance that HP and Poly will obtain all required
regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all. Failure to obtain the necessary clearances in any of these jurisdictions could substantially
delay or prevent the consummation of the merger, which could negatively impact both HP and Poly.
Poly and HP have each agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to provide any reasonably necessary information in connection with
any presentations, memoranda, briefs or other submissions made or provided to any governmental authority by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings or regulatory reviews under or relating to the HSR Act or any other antitrust law or foreign regulatory law (which includes
both foreign antitrust laws and FDI laws) related to the merger.
Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary
approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory
approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how
long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial
period of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances
and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result
in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

HP’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the merger agreement are not conditioned on the receipt or availability of any funds, or subject to any
financing condition. HP intends to finance the transaction using its cash on hand and/or borrowings, and has represented to us in the merger agreement
that it has sufficient funds to pay the aggregate merger consideration.

members of the Poly Board, captioned Stein v. Plantronics, Inc., et al., No. 1:2-cv-03574. On May 5, 2022, a purported Poly stockholder filed a complaint in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Poly and the members of the Poly Board, captioned Whitfield v. Plantronics, Inc., et al.,
No. 1:22-cv-02583. On May 11, 2022, a purported Poly stockholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against
Poly and the members of the Poly Board, captioned Vicknair v. Plantronics, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-02753. On May 12, 2022, a purported Poly stockholder
filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Poly and the members of the Poly Board, captioned Justice, II v.
Plantronics, Inc., et al., No. 2:22-cv-01861. We refer to the complaints referenced in this paragraph collectively as the “Complaints”. The Complaints assert
claims against all defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder for allegedly false and misleading
statements in Poly’s preliminary proxy statement and against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged control
person liability with respect to such allegedly false or misleading statements. The Complaints seek, among other relief, (1) to enjoin defendants from
consummating the merger; (2) to rescind the merger or recover damages, if the merger is completed; (3) to require the individual defendants to issue a
revised proxy statement; (4) declaratory relief; and (5) attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants believe that the claims are without merit. Additional
lawsuits arising out of the merger may be filed in the future. No assurances can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or the Complaints.

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires
that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable by
Poly to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests
of Poly’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the additional disclosures referenced therein that
otherwise are disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Poly’s Directors and Executive Officers in the

We are asking our stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Poly to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Poly’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes and additional disclosures referenced therein.
The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made generally have previously formed part of Poly’s
overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the
Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Poly Board, which is composed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be
reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Plantronics, Inc. (“Poly”) approve the compensation that will or may become payable to Poly’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests
of Poly’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” in Poly’s proxy statement for the special meeting.”
Our stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a nonbinding, advisory vote, the result will
not be binding on Poly, the Poly Board or HP. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to
stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated our named executive officers will be
eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to
those payments.

determined in good faith by the Poly Board, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
special meeting. If stockholders approve this proposal, we can adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the
additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting
against adoption of the merger agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to adopt the merger agreement would be
defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares

The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger agreement in this summary and
elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached
to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the
merger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about
the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement,
and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made only for
purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be
subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Poly, HP and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating
the terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to
reports and documents filed with the SEC and from those applicable to investors, and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to
HP and Merger Sub by Poly in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the
merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Poly and HP and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts.
Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the
merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a
change in circumstance or otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of
Poly, HP or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations
and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger,
and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not rely on the
covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Poly, HP and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain
actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate
party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to
provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Poly, HP, Merger
Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger agreement should not
be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Poly and our
business. Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions; or (2) at such other time as agreed to in writing by Poly and HP. On the closing date of
the merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will
become effective upon the filing of that certificate of merger, or at a later time as may be agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate
of merger.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of our common
stock (other than as specified in the merger agreement) pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL will be canceled and
automatically converted into the right to receive the per share price in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes (or, in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and indemnity, if required) in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement).
At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of our common stock that is (1) held by Poly as treasury stock, (2) owned by HP or
Merger Sub, or (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HP or Merger Sub will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. At the effective time of the merger, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of our common
stock of the surviving corporation.
Equity Awards; ESPP
The merger agreement provides that Poly’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and the Poly
ESPP will be subject to the following treatment at or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger:

Treatment of Poly Equity-Based Awards
Each share of Poly Restricted Stock will vest in full and become free of restrictions as of the effective time of the merger and will be converted into
the right to receive the per share price under the same terms and conditions as apply to the receipt of the per share price by holders of Poly common
stock generally.
Poly RSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger agreement (excluding any Poly Interim RSUs) will be canceled and converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Poly common stock subject to such Poly RSU immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger multiplied by (B) the per share price. This amount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder
at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger.
Poly PSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger agreement (excluding any Poly Interim PSUs) will be canceled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the total number of shares of Poly common stock subject to such Poly PSU immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger (calculated based on the terms of the Poly equity plan and applicable award agreement governing such Poly PSU and based
on actual performance against performance targets with such performance determined as of five business days prior to the effective time of the merger)
multiplied by (B) the per share price. This amount (less any required withholdings and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably
promptly after the effective time of the merger.
Poly Interim RSUs that were granted on or after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the effective time of the merger (including Poly
Converted Interim RSUs) will be either (in the sole discretion of HP): (A) assumed by HP and converted into restricted stock units with respect to a
number of shares of HP’s common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of
shares of our common stock subject to such Poly Interim RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger by (ii) the quotient obtained by
dividing (a) the per share price by (b) the average closing price per share of HP’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten trading-day
period ending on the trading day preceding the closing date of the merger, but subject to the vesting schedule that is applicable to such Poly Interim RSU
as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger and the other terms and conditions applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately
prior to the closing of the merger; or (B) canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the total number of shares of our
common stock subject to such Poly Interim RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (ii) the per share price, with such
amount payable on the vesting schedule that is applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger and
otherwise subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to such Poly Interim RSU as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the merger. For
any consideration described in prior clause (A), HP will issue the Poly Interim RSU Merger Consideration in the form of restricted stock units covering
shares of HP’s common stock at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger, or for any consideration described in prior clause (B), the
Poly Interim RSU Merger Consideration will be paid in cash (less any required withholding and other taxes) according to the applicable vesting schedule,
to each holder of Poly Interim RSUs with respect to such holder’s Poly Interim RSUs.
Poly Interim PSUs that were granted on or after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the effective time of the merger will be canceled and
exchanged for a Poly Converted Interim RSU with respect to a number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of shares of our common stock
subject to such Poly Interim PSU with respect to target performance and with the same remaining time-based vesting schedule that would have been
applicable had the Poly Interim PSU been initially granted as a Poly Interim RSU and such award will be treated as a Poly Interim RSU as described above.

Treatment of Poly Options
Poly options that have an exercise price per share of our common stock that is less than the per share price, whether or not exercisable or vested
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the excess of the per share price over the
exercise price of such Poly option by (B) the number of shares of our common stock subject to such Poly option. This amount (less any required
withholdings and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after the effective time of the merger.
Poly options that have an exercise price per share of our common stock that is equal to or greater than the per share price, whether or not
exercisable or vested, will be canceled without payment.
Treatment of the ESPP
The ESPP will be frozen and suspended at the end of the offering period that is in progress as of the date of the merger agreement and no new
offering periods will commence under the ESPP at any time on or after the date of the merger agreement. No current participants in the ESPP will be
permitted to increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions under the ESPP from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement or
make any separate non-payroll contribution to the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement. If any offering period that is in progress as of
the date of the merger agreement continues to be in progress as of the effective time of the merger, such offering period will be shortened in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP to a date on or prior to the closing date of the merger. The ESPP will terminate prior to, and contingent upon, the effective time

Prior to the effective time of the merger, HP will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Poly (which we refer to as the “paying
agent”) to make payments of the merger consideration to our stockholders. At or prior to the closing of the merger, HP will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the paying agent cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate per share price to our stockholders in accordance with the
merger agreement.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger, HP will cause the paying agent to provide to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented outstanding
shares of our common stock, a letter of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for merger
consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together
with any required indemnity); and (2) a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the
paying agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of our
common stock represented by such certificate and (b) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such Poly stockholders will not include
interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of our common stock held in book-entry form (which we refer to as “uncertificated shares”)
will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal (as both are described above) to the paying agent to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof. Each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of uncertificated shares that
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of our common stock will, upon receipt by the paying agent of an
“agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence as the paying agent may reasonably require), and any documents as may reasonably be
requested by the paying agent, be entitled to receive, and the paying agent will pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable, an
90Table of Contents
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock represented by such holder’s uncertificated shares; and
(2) the per share price. The amount of consideration paid to such Poly stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable
withholding taxes.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent is not claimed within 12 months following the effective time of the merger, such cash will be returned to
HP upon demand, and any of our stockholders as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger who have not complied with the exchange
procedures specified in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to HP for satisfaction of payment of the merger consideration (subject to
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar laws). None of the paying agent, HP, Merger Sub, Poly, the surviving corporation or any other party will
be liable to any of our stockholder with respect to any cash amounts paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat
law or similar laws.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the
event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then the paying agent will issue the per share price to such holder upon the making
by such holder of an affidavit for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. The surviving corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of the per share price, require such stockholder to deliver an indemnity against any claim that may be made against HP or the surviving
corporation with respect to such certificate.",98,99

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of Poly, HP and Merger Sub.
Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by Poly are qualified as to “materiality” or “company material adverse
effect.” For purposes of the merger agreement and this proxy statement, “company material adverse effect” means any change, effect, event, occurrence
or state of facts that, taken alone or together with any other related or unrelated changes, effects, events, occurrences or states of facts, (1) has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of Poly and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; or (2) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair Poly from being able to consummate the merger at the closing. For
purposes of clause (1), in no event will any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development arising from or related to the following be
deemed to be or constitute a company material adverse effect or be taken into account when determining whether a company material adverse effect has
occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur:
a)
changes in economic, business or regulatory conditions and changes in the conditions generally of the industries, businesses or segments
in which Poly and its subsidiaries operate;
b)
conditions affecting the United States economy or the global economy generally or political conditions (including results of elections) in
the United States or any other jurisdiction in the world;
c)
the continuation or worsening of supply chain disruptions affecting the industries, businesses or segments in which Poly and its
subsidiaries operate;
d)
war, acts of war, military conflicts, terrorism, insurrection, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, nuclear disasters, wildfires, floods,

agreement, along with any quarantine, “shelter in place,” “stay at home,” workforce reduction, social distancing, shut down, closure,
sequester, safety or similar law, directive or guidelines promulgated by any governmental authority in connection with or in response to
COVID-19 (which we collectively refer to as “COVID-19 measures”) and any actions taken reasonably and in good faith in response to
COVID-19 measures (or any other response to COVID-19);

g)
changes in GAAP or the binding interpretation thereof after the date of the merger agreement;

changes in any laws or the binding interpretation thereof after the date of the merger agreement;
i)
any failure in and of itself by Poly to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in respect of revenues,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period after the date hereof or any change in and of itself in the market price or
trading volume of the Poly common stock (it being understood that the facts or causes underlying or contributing to any such failure or
change may be considered in determining whether a company material adverse effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to
occur);

merger agreement), pendency of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

except in the case of clauses (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) above, to the extent disproportionately affecting Poly and its subsidiaries relative to other
appropriately comparable companies in the industries in which Poly and its subsidiaries operate (in which case only the incremental disproportionate
adverse impact may be taken into account in determining whether a company material adverse effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to
occur).

Following the date of the merger agreement, Poly has agreed to immediately cease, and to not authorize or permit any of its representatives to
continue, any discussions or negotiations with any person and its representatives (other than HP and its representatives) relating to a takeover proposal
or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a takeover proposal, and has agreed to terminate any data room access of, and
promptly request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to, any such person within the last 12 months for
the purpose of allowing any such person to evaluate a possible takeover proposal.
In addition, from the date of the merger agreement to the effective time of the merger (or the earlier termination of the merger agreement) Poly will
not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, and will not authorize or permit any of their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives to:

cooperate with the making of any takeover proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a takeover
proposal;
•

Further, from the date of the merger agreement to the effective time of the merger agreement (or the earlier termination of the merger agreement) Poly
will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to:
•
waive, terminate, modify, fail to enforce or release any person (other than HP, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates) under any “standstill”
or similar agreement or obligation, or propose, resolve or agree to do the foregoing, unless, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by
Poly’s stockholders, the Poly Board determines in good faith and after consultation with and receipt of advice from outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties, in which event the Poly Board may grant a waiver under such “standstill” or similar agreement solely to the extent to permit such
person to make a non-public proposal to the Poly Board;
•
exempt any person (other than HP, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on “business combinations” contained in
Section 203 of the DGCL (or similar provisions of any other takeover laws); or

•
propose, resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.
However, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Poly stockholders, if the Poly Board receives an unsolicited, written bona fide
takeover proposal that was not solicited in breach or deemed breach of the non-solicitation covenants, and (1) the Poly Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with and receipt of advice from outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal; and (2) the Poly Board determines in good faith, after consultation with and receipt of advice from
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take the actions in the bulleted paragraphs below
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Poly under Delaware law, then, subject to Poly providing to HP prior written notice
of its decision to take such action, the identity of the person making such takeover proposal or inquiry, the terms of such proposal or inquiry and
unredacted copies of agreements and similar documents and material correspondence relating to such proposal or inquiry, the Poly Board may:
•
furnish information with respect to Poly to the person making such takeover proposal and its representatives pursuant to an “acceptable
confidentiality agreement” (provided that any information provided to such person shall have previously been provided to HP or its
representatives or will be provided to HP or its representatives prior to or at the same time as it is provided to such person); and
•
participate in discussions or negotiations with such person and its representatives regarding such takeover proposal.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement:
•
“takeover proposal” means any proposal or offer made by a third party to Poly or the Poly Board (1) for a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, dual listed company structure, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, strategic alliance, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar transaction involving Poly except, in each case, for any such transaction that would not be material to Poly;
(2) for the issuance by Poly of more than 15 percent of its shares of capital stock (whether by voting power or number of shares) as
consideration for the assets or securities of another person or business; (3) to acquire in any manner (including by a tender or exchange
offer), directly or indirectly, more than 15 percent of the shares of capital stock of Poly (whether by voting power or number of shares) or
assets or businesses that represent or constitute more than 15 percent of the revenues or assets of Poly and its subsidiaries; or (4) to sell,
lease, exclusively license, mortgage, pledge or otherwise transfer (including through any arrangement having substantially the same
economic effect as a sale of assets) assets or businesses that represent or constitute more than 15 percent of the revenues or assets of Poly
and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, or sales, leases, licenses or dispositions of assets in the ordinary course of business;
•
“superior proposal” means any bona fide written takeover proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition of “superior proposal” all
references to 15 percent in the definition of “takeover proposal” shall be deemed to be references to 85 percent) made by a third party (who
is not an affiliate of Poly) that is fully financed or has fully committed financing to consummate such transaction (including the repayment
of at least 85 percent of the outstanding indebtedness of Poly and its subsidiaries) and that (1) is on terms that the Poly Board reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with and after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, to be more favorable to the holders of our common stock from a financial point of view than the merger, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the merger agreement (including any subsequent proposal received from HP);
and (2) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account financial, regulatory (including
antitrust laws), legal, closing certainty and timing and other aspects of such proposal and such additional factors as the Poly Board
considers to be appropriate; and

•
“acceptable confidentiality agreement” means a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the
confidentiality agreement between Poly and HP (as amended); provided, that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit or purport to
prohibit Poly in any way from complying with the merger agreement or include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with
Poly, the Poly Board (or any committee thereof) or their representatives or providing for expense reimbursement of the other party.
For purposes of the non-solicitation covenant, a “deemed breach” is any action taken by a person listed in Exhibit A to the confidentiality
agreement between Poly and HP (as amended), any Poly director, any Poly employee with the title of senior vice president or more senior or any financial

The Poly Board has recommended that the holders of shares of our common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Except
as provided below, neither the Poly board (nor a committee thereof) may (1) make an “adverse recommendation change;” (2) adopt, approve, authorize,
cause or permit Poly or any of its subsidiaries to enter into a takeover proposal or any letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement relating to any takeover proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement as
described above), or resolve or agree to take any such action; and (3) submit any takeover proposal to the our stockholders for approval or adoption. We
refer to any of the following actions as an “adverse recommendation change”:
•
withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to HP or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to HP or Merger Sub, the Poly Board’s recommendation to our stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or its declaration of
advisability, or resolve or agree to take any such action;
•
endorse or recommend or propose publicly to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any takeover proposal or resolve or agree to take any
such action;
•
following the date that takeover proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public or sent or given to our stockholders, fail to
issue a press release publicly reaffirming the Poly Board recommendation to our stockholders to adopt the merger agreement within five
business days (or, if earlier, by the second business day prior to the outside date) after a written request by HP to do so, which request can
only be made twice per takeover proposal or once per each material modification;
•
following the commencement by any person of a tender or exchange offer for shares of our common stock, fail to publicly issue a rejection
of such tender offer or exchange offer in a within ten business days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer; or
•
fail to include the Poly Board’s recommendation to our stockholders to adopt the merger agreement in this proxy statement when
disseminated to our stockholders.
However, at any time before our stockholders adopt the merger agreement, Poly may make an adverse recommendation change in response to (1) an
intervening event or (2) a superior proposal; or terminate the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for such superior proposal, but in each case only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
•
Poly or the Poly Board has received a superior proposal after the date of the merger agreement that was not solicited in breach or deemed
breach of the non-solicitation covenant and did not result, directly or
99Table of Contents
indirectly, from a breach in any material respect or deemed breach in any material respect of the non-solicitation covenant (except in the case
of an intervening event) or an intervening event has occurred;
•
in light of such superior proposal (except in the case of an intervening event) or such intervening event, as the case may be, the Poly Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with and after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel and consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to make an adverse recommendation change in response to an
intervening event or superior proposal or to terminate the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Poly under Delaware law (we refer to any such determination as a “withdrawal determination”);
•
Poly has notified HP in writing that it has made a withdrawal determination (we refer to any such notice as a “triggering notice”) and
provided HP unredacted copies of the documents and/or agreements providing for the superior proposal (including any other documents or
agreements referred to in or to be entered into in connection with the superior proposal) or described the intervening event in writing in
reasonable detail, as the case may be;
•
at least five business days must have passed following receipt by HP of the triggering notice (we refer to such time period as the “notice
period”), and during the notice period, if requested by HP, Poly must have negotiated in good faith with HP to permit HP to make a proposal
to amend the terms of the merger or the merger agreement (provided that, in the event of a successive modification to the financial or other
material terms of a takeover proposal that is determined to be a superior proposal, and any material change to an intervening event, the new
notice period will be the longer of three business days and the remaining period under the original notice period prior to the delivery of the
successive modification notice);
•
at the end of the notice period, and taking into account any irrevocable written proposals that are irrevocable through the end of the notice
period to amend the terms of the merger or the merger agreement made by HP since receipt of the triggering notice (we refer to such
proposal as an “HP proposal”), such superior proposal remains a superior proposal and the Poly Board has again made a withdrawal
determination in response to such superior proposal or such intervening event is continuing and the Poly Board has again made a
withdrawal determination in response to such superior proposal or intervening event (it being understood and agreed that if, in the light of
any HP proposal, the Poly Board is no longer able to make a withdrawal determination with respect to such superior proposal or intervening
event, then Poly shall immediately enter into amendments to the merger agreement with HP and the Merger Sub that embodies the terms of
such HP proposal);
•
Poly is in compliance in all material respects with non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement; and
•
Poly has terminated the merger agreement and paid the termination fee to HP and promptly after such termination enters into a definitive
agreement providing for such superior proposal, in the case of a termination of the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal in
order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for such superior proposal.
The merger agreement also requires that Poly, from the date of the merger agreement to the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger
agreement and the effective time of the merger, promptly (within 24 hours) advise HP in writing of any takeover proposal or any inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to the making of a takeover proposal, the identity of the person making the takeover proposal or inquiry and the terms of
the takeover proposal. Thereafter, Poly also must keep HP reasonably informed of the status of the takeover proposal, including any changes to the
material terms of any such takeover proposal, and provide to HP as soon as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof
by or to Poly or its representatives un-redacted copies of all offers, proposals, drafts and final versions (and any amendments thereto) of agreements and
financing documents, including schedules, exhibits and side letters relating to the

If the merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of our stockholders.
However, if the merger is not completed, our stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
Poly will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2022 only if the merger has not already been completed.
Stockholders who intend to have a proposal considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for presentation at our 2022 annual meeting of
stockholders which we refer to as the “2022 annual meeting”, if held, pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act must have submitted the proposal to
us no later than February 16, 2022.
Stockholders wishing to present business at an annual meeting may do so by filing with our Corporate Secretary a “Business Solicitation
Statement,” containing, among other things, certain information about the business the stockholder intends to bring before the 2022 annual meeting and
the stockholder proposing such business. Stockholders wishing to nominate a director for election to the Poly Board may do so by filing with the
Corporate Secretary a “Nominee Solicitation Statement” containing, among other things, certain information about the nominee and the stockholder
nominating such nominee.
For the 2022 annual meeting, the Business Solicitation Statement or the Nominee Solicitation Statement, as applicable, must be filed with our
Corporate Secretary not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the one-year
anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting of stockholders. In the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year, or if the date of
the 2022 annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 60 days after the one-year anniversary of the date of the
previous year’s annual meeting, then, for notice by the stockholder to be timely, it must be received by the Corporate Secretary not later than the 10th day
following the day on which a public announcement (as described in the bylaws) of the date of 2022 annual meeting is first made by us.
Our bylaws contain additional details about requirements for the Business Solicitation Statement and the Nominee Solicitation Statement as well as
certain procedural requirements for the proposal of business and the nomination of directors. You should also review our Corporate Governance
Guidelines and our Director Candidates Nomination Policy, which contain additional information about the nomination of directors. Our bylaws,

March 25, 2022
Board of Directors
Plantronics, Inc.
345 Encinal St.
Santa Cruz, California 95060
Members of the Board:
We understand that Plantronics, Inc. (the “Company”), HP Inc. (“Parent”) and PRISM SUBSIDIARY CORP., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(“Merger Sub”), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 25, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among
other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other
than shares of Company Common Stock that are, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (i) owned by the Company as treasury stock,
(ii) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) held by holders of such shares who
have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who have properly and validly exercised their
statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares in accordance with, in all respects, Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the “Excluded Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive $40.00 per share in cash, without interest
(the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the
holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
1)
Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company;
2)
Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company;
3)
Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company and certain extrapolations prepared with guidance from the
management of the Company (which were reviewed and approved for our use by the management of the Company)(collectively, the “Financial
Projections”);
4)
Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of the Company;
5)
Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
6)
Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock with that of certain other
publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company and their securities;
7)
Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
8)
Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and Parent and their financial and legal advisors;
B-1Table of Contents
9)
Reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and
10)
Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or
supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the Financial Projections, we
have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to such Financial Projections or the assumptions on which they
were based. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without
any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any
material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary
governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be
imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax or
regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal,
tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to
any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. We express no
opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of
such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the
Excluded Shares) in the Merger. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used
in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory
and financing services for Parent and the Company and have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide
financial advisory and financing services to Parent and the Company and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the
rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management
businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and
derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates,
directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may
trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Parent,
the Company and their respective affiliates, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related
derivative instrument.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our customary
practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without
our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by

applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the stockholders of the Company should vote at the
stockholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.
Very truly yours,
MORGAN STANLEY & CO. LLC

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, each share of Company Common Stock that is
owned by the Company as treasury stock or that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub (collectively, the “Canceled Shares”) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.
(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock.
(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common
Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, subject to Section 2.01(b), Section 2.01(d), Section 2.01(e) and Section 2.02(h), each outstanding

(ii) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a “Certificate”) or evidence of shares in book-entry form (“Uncertificated Shares”), in each
case, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with Section
2.02, without interest.
(d) Adjustments. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
subdivision or combination, reorganization or exchange of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted so as to provide Parent and the holder of shares of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing in this Section 2.01(d) shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
(e) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person who has neither voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement nor consented
thereto in writing and who has properly and validly exercised its statutory rights of appraisal of such shares (“Appraisal Shares”) pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”) shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c),
but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262;
provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of fair value under
Section 262 then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares formerly representing such shares. The
Company shall give Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in, and following the Effective Time direct, all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment to the holder
of such Appraisal Shares with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.",134,135

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
“Paying Agent”) for the payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in accordance with this Section 2.02,
and shall enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent. At or prior to the
Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all the cash necessary to pay for the shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange
Fund”).
(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to provide to (i)
each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration and (ii) each holder of Uncertificated Shares
A-3Table of Contents
(A) materials advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Uncertificated Shares into the right to receive Merger
Consideration and (B) a cash payment in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.01 with respect to such Uncertificated Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to provide to the holder of such Certificate, in exchange therefor, a cash payment in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. For the avoidance of doubt, a
holder of Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to such Uncertificated Shares; provided that in lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Uncertificated Shares shall,
upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably
require), be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares in exchange for Merger Consideration and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
provide to such holder of Uncertificated Shares, in exchange therefor, a cash payment in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to such Uncertificated Shares.
(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of
this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock (including any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to this Section
2.02(c)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
prior to the date of this Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to the Company Common Stock as contemplated by this Article II.
(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Uncertificated Share has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
A-4
Table of Contents
which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.
(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily
basis; provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s
Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of and shall be paid to Parent. To the
extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason (other than
as a result of payments therefrom pursuant to this Agreement) below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the remaining cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.01; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Paying Agent on behalf of Parent) to
promptly pay the remaining cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.01 in full for any reason, then Parent shall promptly replace or restore (or cause to
be promptly replaced or restored) the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for
distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make the remaining payments contemplated by Section 2.01 in full.
(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a cash payment in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation may, as a condition precedent to the payment of such
consideration, require such Person to deliver a customary indemnity to the Surviving Corporation and Parent against any claim that may be made against
the Surviving Corporation and Parent with respect to such Certificate.
(h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid. Compensatory amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement that are subject to payroll reporting and
withholding pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be payable through applicable payroll procedures.

terms and the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any officer,
director, employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative (collectively, with respect to any Person, such Person’s
“Representatives”) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal,
or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, enable or cooperate with the making of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into,

Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (iv) propose, resolve or agree to do any of the
foregoing. The Company shall (A) immediately cease, and not authorize or permit any of its Representatives to continue, all discussions and negotiations
with any person (other than with Parent and its Representatives) regarding any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (B) promptly (and in any event, within 1 Business Day) after the date hereof request the prompt return or

and the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, (x) waive, terminate, modify, fail to enforce, or release
any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates) under any “standstill” or similar agreement or obligation or propose, resolve or
agree to do the foregoing, unless, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (which may take into account the
recommendation of a committee thereof) determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with and receipt of advice from outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law, in which event the Company Board may grant a waiver under such “standstill” or similar agreement or obligation solely to the extent to
permit such Person to make a non-public proposal to the Company Board or (y) exempt any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
affiliates) from the restrictions on “business combinations” contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or similar provisions of any other Takeover Law) or
propose, resolve, or agree to do the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the
Company or the Company Board receives a bona fide written Takeover Proposal after the date hereof that was not solicited in breach or deemed breach of
this Section 5.02(a) and did not otherwise result from a breach in any material respect or deemed breach in any material respect of this Section 5.02(a) and
that (1) the Company Board (which may take into account the recommendation of a committee thereof) determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with and after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (2) the Company Board (which may take into account the recommendation of a committee
thereof) determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with and after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take the actions specified in the following clauses (I) and/or (II) of this sentence with respect to such
Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law, then, subject to providing
prior written notice of its decision to take such action to Parent and compliance with Section 5.02(c), the Company may (I) furnish information with
respect to the Company to the person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
(provided that any information provided to such person shall have previously been provided to Parent or its Representatives or shall be provided to
Parent or its Representatives prior to or at the same time as it is provided to such person) and (II) participate in discussions or negotiations with such
person and its Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees: (x) that any action taken by any
Specified Person, any director of the Company, any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with a title of senior vice president or more
senior or
A-39Table of Contents
any financial or legal advisor of the Company, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
that, if taken by the Company or a Company Subsidiary, would constitute a breach of any provision set forth in this Section 5.02(a) shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company; and (y) if the Company becomes aware of an action by any Representative of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary not described in prior clause (x), whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, that, if taken by the Company or a Company Subsidiary, would constitute a breach of any provision set forth in this Section 5.02(a) and the
Company does not promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prohibit or terminate such action, then such action shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.02(a) by the Company. The Company shall not provide (and shall not permit any of its Representatives to provide) any non-public information
that is commercially or competitively sensitive (it being agreed that if such information was provided to Parent pursuant to “clean room” procedures, then
it shall be considered commercially or competitively sensitive) to any person(s) in connection with the actions permitted by this Section 5.02(a), except in
accordance with “clean room” or other similar procedures that are consistent in all material respects (including with respect to the scope of information
restricted thereby) with the Company’s practices in dealing with the disclosures of such information to Parent and its Representatives in connection with
the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
(b) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective Time,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or its declaration of
advisability, or resolve or agree to take any such action, (B) endorse or recommend or propose publicly to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action, (C) following the date that any Takeover Proposal or any material modification thereto is
first made public or sent or given to the stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a press release publicly reaffirming the Company Board
Recommendation within five Business Days after (or, if earlier, by the second Business Day prior to the Outside Date) a written request by Parent to do
so, which request shall only be made twice per Takeover Proposal or once per each material modification or material change to a Takeover Proposal, (D)
following the commencement by any person of a tender or exchange offer for shares of Company Common Stock, fail to publicly issue a rejection of such
tender or exchange offer within 10 Business Days after the commencement thereof (it being agreed that the Company Board may refrain from publicly
issuing a rejection of such tender or exchange offer until the close of business on the 10th Business Day after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer without such action being considered an Adverse Recommendation Change so long as the Company Board publicly issues a rejection of
such tender or exchange offer no later than immediately after the close of business on such 10th Business Day), or (E) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement when disseminated to the Company’s stockholders (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
herein as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) (A) adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action, (B)
approve, authorize, cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
relating to any Takeover Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (an “Acquisition Agreement”), or resolve or agree to take any
such action or (C) submit any Takeover Proposal to the stockholders of the Company for approval, acceptance, endorsement, recommendation or
adoption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and only at a time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may (x) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, (y) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal or (z) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) in response to a Superior Proposal in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal, but in each case only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the Company or the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal after the date hereof that was not solicited in breach or deemed breach of Section 5.02(a) and did not, directly or indirectly,
otherwise result from a breach in any material respect or deemed breach in any material respect of Section 5.02(a) (in the case of the preceding clause (y)
or clause (z)), or an Intervening Event has occurred (in the
A-40
Table of Contents
case of the preceding clause (x)); (2) in light of such Superior Proposal (in the case of the preceding clause (y) or clause (z)) or such Intervening Event (in
the case of the preceding clause (x)), as the case may be, the Company Board (which may take into account the recommendation of a committee thereof)
shall have determined in their good faith judgment, after consultation with and after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change (in the case of the preceding clause (x) or clause (y)) or to
terminate this Agreement (in the case of the preceding clause (z)) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under Delaware Law (any such determination, a “Withdrawal Determination”); (3) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it has made a
Withdrawal Determination (any such notice, a “Triggering Notice”) and provided Parent un-redacted copies of the documents and/or agreements
providing for the Superior Proposal (including any other documents or agreements referred to in or to be entered into in connection with the Superior
Proposal) (provided that the Company may provide Parent a redacted copy of any debt commitment fee letter, to the extent un-redacted copies thereof are
not made available to the Company) or described the Intervening Event in writing in reasonable detail, as the case may be; (4) at least five Business Days
shall have passed following receipt by Parent of the Triggering Notice (such time period, the “Notice Period”), and during the Notice Period, if requested
by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent to permit Parent to make a proposal to amend the terms of the Transactions or this
Agreement; (5) at the end of the Notice Period, and taking into account any written proposals that are irrevocable through the end of the Notice Period to
amend the terms of the Transactions or this Agreement made by Parent since receipt of the Triggering Notice (a “Parent Proposal”), such Superior
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and the Company Board (which may take into account the recommendation of a committee thereof) has again made
a Withdrawal Determination in response to such Superior Proposal or such Intervening Event is continuing and the Company Board (which may take into
account the recommendation of a committee thereof) has again made a Withdrawal Determination in response to such Intervening Event, as the case may
be (it being understood and agreed that if, in light of any Parent Proposal, the Company Board is no longer able to make a Withdrawal Determination with
respect to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, then Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall immediately enter into an amendment to this
Agreement that embodies the terms of such Parent Proposal); (6) the Company is in compliance in all material respects with Section 5.02 and (7) the
Company has paid the Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 8.02 and promptly after such termination enters into a definitive agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal, in the case of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to the preceding clause (z). The Company acknowledges
and agrees that each successive modification to the financial terms or other material terms of a Takeover Proposal that is determined to be a Superior
Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new Superior Proposal, and any material change to the Intervening Event shall be deemed to constitute a new
Intervening Event, in each case, for purposes of the second sentence of Section 5.02(b) and shall require a new compliance with the second sentence of
Section 5.02(b) and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall require a new Notice Period (except that the five Business Day notice period referred to in the
Notice Period shall instead be equal to the longer of (I) three Business Days and (II) the period remaining under the Notice Period immediately prior to the
delivery of such additional or successive notice under this sentence).
(c) The Company shall promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours after receipt thereof) advise Parent in writing of the making of any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to the making of a Takeover Proposal, the identity of the person making any
such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the terms of any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
including any change to the financial terms or other material terms of any such Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to Parent, as soon as practicable (and
in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof by or to the Company or its Representatives, un-redacted copies of all offers, proposals,
drafts and final versions (and any amendments thereto) of agreements and financing documents, including schedules, exhibits and side letters thereto,
relating to the Takeover Proposal (including any other documents or agreements referred to in or to be entered into in connection with the Takeover
Proposal) (provided that the Company may provide Parent a redacted copy of any debt commitment fee letter, to the extent un-redacted copies thereof are
not made available to the Company), and other material correspondence, sent or provided to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives by the person making such Takeover Proposal or such person’s

Representatives or sent or provided by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to the person making such Takeover
Proposal or such person’s Representatives.
(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including
making a “stop, look and listen” communication to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; (ii) complying with
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 5.02; or (iv) making any disclosure to its stockholders that the Company Board (which may take into account the recommendation of a committee
thereof) is required to make in order to comply with applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company Board or any committee
thereof make any Adverse Recommendation Change except in compliance with Section 5.02(b); and provided further that any such disclosure that is
made pursuant to immediately preceding clause (ii) or, to the extent related to or in connection with a Takeover Proposal or a Triggering Notice or
Withdrawal Determination with respect to an Intervening Event, clause (iv), that does not contain an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change. None of the following actions shall in and of itself be deemed to constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change: (A) the deliberation by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) regarding a Takeover Proposal, or the
determination by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that a Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal; (B) a Withdrawal Determination; (C) the delivery to Parent of a Triggering Notice; or (D) the public disclosure of any action described
in the preceding clauses (A), (B) or (C) if such disclosure is required by applicable Law, so long as any such disclosure (x) does not include any statement
that constitutes, and does not otherwise constitute, an Adverse Recommendation Change and (y) includes an express reaffirmation of the Company
Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.02(d) or the second sentence of Section 5.02(b), unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, the Company Board or any committee thereof may not take, agree or resolve to take any action that would result in the
Company’s stockholders no longer being legally capable under the DGCL of validly adopting this Agreement.

to sell, lease, exclusively license, mortgage, pledge or otherwise transfer (including through any arrangement having substantially the same
economic effect as a sale of assets) assets or businesses that represent or constitute more than 15% of the revenues or assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, in each case other than the Transactions or
sales, leases, licenses or dispositions of assets in the ordinary course of business.
“Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Takeover Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition of “Superior
Proposal” all references to 15% in the definition of “Takeover Proposal” shall be deemed to be references to 85%) made by a third party (who is not
an affiliate of the Company) that is fully financed or has fully committed financing to consummate such transaction (including the repayment of at
least 85% of the outstanding indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and that (i) is on terms that the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and after receipt

of advice from outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to be more favorable to the holders of Company
Common Stock from a financial point of view than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any Parent Proposal) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into

factors as the Company Board considers to be appropriate.
“Intervening Event” means a material, fact, event, change, development or circumstance related to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole that first occurs after the date of this Agreement that (i) is unknown to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the Company

consequences of which were not known and reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date hereof) and (ii) becomes known to or by
the Company Board prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that in no event shall (A) the receipt of a
Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal, (B) any changes in the market price or trading volume of the shares of Company Common Stock, (C) any
breach by the Company of this Agreement or (D) the fact, in and of itself, that the Company exceeds internal or published projections, in any of the
foregoing cases, constitute or be taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred (it being understood that the facts
or causes underlying or contributing to any of the matters described the preceding clause (B) or (D) may be considered in determining whether an
Intervening Event has occurred).

complying with this Section 5.02 or this Agreement or include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company, the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) or their Representatives or providing for expense reimbursement of the other party.

hereof (and in any event no later than the 25th Business Day immediately after the date hereof (or, if such calendar day is not a Business Day, on the first
Business Day subsequent to such calendar day)), prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any questions or comments of the
SEC or proxy advisory firm with respect thereto (including any oral response to comments), the Company (i) shall provide Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including any proposed oral response to comments), (ii) shall consider in
good faith inclusion in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) subject to the foregoing, shall not file or mail
such document, or respond to the SEC or a proxy advisory firm, prior to receiving the approval of Parent or its counsel, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing to the Company in
writing upon request any and all information relating to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy

Statement (such information, the “Parent Supplied Information”), which, subject to the following proviso, shall be the responsibility of Parent; provided
that, the Company shall be responsible if Parent notifies the Company in
A-43Table of Contents
writing of a correction to any such information and the Company fails to promptly incorporate such correction into the Proxy Statement and (B) Parent
and Merger Sub assume no responsibility with respect to any information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement other than the
Parent Supplied Information. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after the later of (I) (x) the 10-day
waiting period under Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act or (y) if earlier, the date on which the SEC confirms it will not review the Proxy Statement and
(II) the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (such later date, the “Clearance Date”), cause the Proxy
Statement to be filed with the SEC in definitive form and to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders (and in no event more than two Business Days after
the Clearance Date) and duly call and give notice of the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval.
(b) Within five Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall make the inquiry (i.e., the “broker search”) required by Rule 14a-
13(a)(1) under the Exchange Act. The Company shall, reasonably in advance of the Clearance Date, establish a record date (the “Record Date”) for
stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and attend, a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the “Company Stockholders Meeting”) for the sole
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, voting on a proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (and, if applicable, the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith). Once the Company has established the Record Date, the
Company shall not change, unless otherwise required by applicable Law (including in connection with the postponement or rescheduling of the

Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval no later than the 40th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a
Business Day, on the first Business Day subsequent to such calendar day) after the date that the mailing of the Proxy Statement has commenced. Once
the Company Stockholder Meeting has been scheduled by the Company, the Company shall not adjourn, postpone, reschedule or recess the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; provided, however, (1) the Company may adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
on no more than two occasions, for up to ten Business Days on each occasion, if there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented for
purposes of a quorum or if there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock voted in favor of giving the Company Stockholder Approval or after
consultation with the Company’s outside counsel, such adjournment or postponement is required in order to disseminate material information to the
Company’s stockholders in connection with their voting at the Company Stockholder Meeting and (2) the Company shall adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting upon the written request by Parent for any of the matters described in the preceding clause (1) on no more than two
occasions, for up to ten Business Days on each occasion. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01 (except in the case of Section 6.01(d), to the extent specifically provided in Section 6.01(d)) shall not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other person of any Takeover Proposal or the making
of any Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company shall provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for the Company
Stockholders Meeting (including interim results) as reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall vote or cause to be voted all shares of Company

of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the U.S. federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business, operations, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, provided, however, that the
Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that, in its reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would result in the waiver of any
attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege, in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or (ii) any Law applicable to the Company or a
Company Subsidiary would preclude Parent and its representatives from gaining access to any properties or information, provided, further, that in either
case the Company will inform Parent of the general nature of the document or information being withheld and reasonably cooperate with Parent to
provide such document or information in a manner that would not result in violation of Law or the loss or waiver of such privilege. Any access to real
property shall be subject to the granting party’s reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform any

cooperate in good faith with Parent to determine if the Company or any Company Subsidiary has, directly or indirectly, any employees, suppliers,
customers or other contractual or business relationships with any Restricted Party and, if any such relationships are identified, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to terminate such relationships prior to or as of the Closing; provided, however, that to the extent any such relationship cannot be
terminated prior to Closing, the Company shall disclose any such relationship to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable and provide Parent with all
information requested by Parent to address Parent’s obligations under applicable Laws and compliance with Parent’s internal policies as of the Effective
Time. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the mutual non-disclosure agreement dated March 30, 2021 between the

the Closing or who become employees of Parent or one of its subsidiaries in connection with the Closing (the “Continuing Employees”) shall receive for
the twelve (12)-month period after Closing (or, if shorter, the period during which such Continuing Employee remains an employee of Parent or one of its

(A) comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (B) comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries. From and after the Closing and as permitted under applicable local law, each
Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in a Parent cash incentive plan on the same basis, and with the same target incentive opportunities,

benefits pursuant to qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, retiree medical benefits, and other retiree health and welfare arrangements), except that

of the foregoing, with respect to any health plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to all
pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements, actively-at-work or similar
requirements, and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their covered dependents to
the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees and their covered dependents under the welfare plans of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the analogous Company Benefit Plan ending on the date that such Continuing
Employee’s participation in the corresponding post-closing plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such post-closing plan for purposes

comments not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any group oral presentations with respect to the above shall be materially

right to employment, continued employment, or any term or condition of employment with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the
ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings
of Parent, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation and nothing therein shall be construed as an amendment, waiver or
creation of any such plan, program, policy, arrangement, agreement or understanding for any purpose. Nothing in this Section 6.05 shall create any third-
party beneficiary or any other rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any current or former employee, officer, director or other individual

provided, however, that Parent or its applicable Subsidiary may, at its option and expense, assume and control the defense of any Claim with one counsel
for all similarly situated Indemnified Persons subject to such Claim, if such counsel is reasonably acceptable to a majority of the Indemnified Persons who
may be entitled to indemnification for such Claim; provided that, if such Claim commenced after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and relates
to this Agreement, the Merger or the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company, then at the election of a majority of such Indemnified
Persons, such counsel shall be the counsel of record prior to the Effective Time for such Claim; provided further that any Indemnified Person may fully

counsel of its own choosing to participate in the defense of such Claim on its behalf, and the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) of defending such Claim shall be indemnified by Parent and the Surviving Corporation to the extent otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. If
Parent or its applicable Subsidiary so assumes the defense of any Claim for such Indemnified Persons pursuant to the foregoing sentence, none of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries will be liable to such Indemnified Persons for any defense costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses)
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Persons in the defense of such Claim (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any other losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs or other expenses therefrom, including from the disposition of any such Claim, that are subject to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 6.07). Neither an Indemnified Person nor the Parent, the Surviving Corporation of any of its Subsidiaries shall settle, compromise or consent

case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of
time at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company’s
existing policies; provided that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such “tail” insurance policy and
the Company shall give good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto; and provided that the premium payable for such
“tail” insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the premium amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (such maximum amount, the
“Maximum Premium”) and if the cost for such “tail” insurance policy exceeds the Maximum Premium, then the Company shall (or Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, as applicable) obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium. Parent shall
cause any such “tail” policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the
Surviving Corporation. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will reasonably cooperate with Parent to assist in obtaining such additional
“tail” insurance policies as Parent may reasonably request.

(a) Any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.01 will be effective (subject to the cure periods provided above) immediately upon
the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the other parties of a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01. In the event of
the valid termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01, there shall be no liability or further obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Representatives; provided, however that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Section 8.02 shall survive such termination and the following shall also survive such termination: Section 6.02 (penultimate sentence
only), Section 6.08, and Article IX; and provided further that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any willful and
material breach of, or fraud with respect to, any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement occurring prior to
such termination. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the date
on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto (unless any provision therein
earlier terminates in accordance with the terms thereof).
(b) The Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent a fee of $66,000,000 (the “Termination Fee”) if: (i) Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d); (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); (iii) a Takeover Proposal (whether or not
conditional and whether or not withdrawn) has been made to the Company or to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise
become publicly known and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) Section 8.01(b)(i) or (y) Section 8.01(c) and (B) within 12 months
of such termination the Company or any Company Subsidiary consummates any Takeover Proposal or enters into a definitive agreement providing for
any Takeover Proposal (in each case, whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same as the original Takeover Proposal made or communicated or that
became publicly known prior to such termination); or (iv) a Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) has been made
to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (B) within 12 months of such termination the Company or any Company Subsidiary consummates any Takeover Proposal or
enters into a definitive agreement providing for any Takeover Proposal (in each case, whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same as the original
Takeover Proposal made or communicated or that became publicly known prior to such termination). Solely for purposes of clauses (iii) and (iv) of the
first sentence of Section 8.02(b): (I) the term “Takeover Proposal” shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in
Section 5.02(e) except that all references to 15% shall be deemed to be references to 50%; and (II) in the event that a “Takeover Proposal” is a transaction
described in clause (i) of the definition of “Takeover Proposal” and one or more Company Subsidiaries is a party to (but the Company is not a party to)
such a transaction, then clause (i) of the definition of “Takeover Proposal”, as it relates to a Company Subsidiary consummating or entering into a
definitive agreement providing for a Takeover Proposal, shall instead be deemed to read “for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, dual listed company structure, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, strategic alliance, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar
transaction involving more than 50% of the revenues or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis”. Any fee due
under this Section 8.02(b)
A-56Table of Contents
shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement (except that in the case of termination pursuant to clauses
(iii) or (iv) above such payment shall be made on the date of execution of the applicable definitive agreement or, if earlier, the date of the consummation of
the applicable Takeover Proposal) to the account designated in Section 8.02(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (which account information may be
updated by Parent by written notice to the Company from time to time). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.02 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b) at a time when Parent would have
had the right to terminate this Agreement and would have been (or would have become) entitled to receive the Termination Fee as a result of such
termination, then Parent shall be entitled to receipt of the Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become) payable had
Parent terminated this Agreement at such time. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.02(b) are an integral part of
the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) as and when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.02(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys’
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.02(b) at the prime lending rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything in the contrary to this
Agreement, in no event will the Company be required to pay more than one Termination Fee, collectively, or be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events.
