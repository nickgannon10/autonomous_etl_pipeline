If the merger is completed, at the effective time, and without any action on the part of the holder, each share
of Activision Blizzard common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other
than shares of Activision Blizzard common stock (i) held by Activision Blizzard as treasury stock (excluding
certain shares held by a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, which shares will remain
outstanding and unaffected by the merger), (ii) owned by Microsoft or Sub or any of their respective direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and (iii) held by stockholders who have neither voted in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who have properly and validly
exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, in each case immediately prior to the effective time), and certain equity awards, the treatment of which
is described under the sections entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - 
Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the Merger - 
Treatment of Equity Compensation” and “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares -

right to receive $95.00 per share in cash, without interest, which we refer to as the “merger consideration,”
less any applicable withholding taxes. All shares, when so converted at the effective time into the right to
receive the merger consideration, will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist.
As described under the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Exchange and Payment

After the merger is completed, under the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, you will have the
right to receive the per share merger consideration, but you no longer will have any rights as an Activision
Blizzard stockholder as a result of the merger (except for the right to receive the per share merger
consideration and except that stockholders who properly exercise and perfect, and do not validly withdraw
or subsequently lose, their demand for appraisal will instead have such rights as granted by Section 262 of

receive a meeting invitation by email with your unique join link along with a password prior to the meeting
date. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in person. For purposes of attendance at
the special meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present in person” or “in person” shall mean
virtually present at the special meeting.
Purpose
At the special meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2022,
which we refer to as the “record date,” to consider and vote on the following proposals:
the adoption of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement
accompanying this proxy statement, which we refer to as the “merger proposal”;
the approval, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become
payable to the named executive officers of Activision Blizzard in connection with the merger, which
we refer to as the “merger-related compensation proposal”; and
the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to allow
time to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the
time of the special meeting, which we refer to as the “adjournment proposal.”
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of Activision Blizzard common stock as of
the close of business on the record date. You will have one vote at the special meeting for each share of
Activision Blizzard common stock you owned as of the close of business on the record date.
Quorum
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum at
the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 780,922,900 shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. If you submit a validly executed proxy
by mail, telephone or the Internet, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In addition, abstentions will
be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of
establishing a quorum. As a result, 390,461,451 shares of Activision Blizzard common stock must be
represented, in person or by proxy, to have a quorum. In the event that a quorum is present at the special
meeting and there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal,
it is expected that the special meeting would be adjourned to allow time to solicit additional proxies if the
holders of a majority of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in
person or by proxy, approve an adjournment. If a quorum is not present, the special meeting may be (and it is
expected that the special meeting would be) adjourned by the presiding person of the meeting pursuant to
the authority granted in Activision Blizzard’s bylaws until a quorum is obtained, subject to the terms of the
merger agreement.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the merger proposal, which we refer to as
“stockholder approval.” This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR”
that proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of shares of our outstanding common stock as of the
record date. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
proposal.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present, is required to
approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-related compensation proposal. This means
that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” that proposal is greater than 50% of
the total number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in

Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Activision Blizzard
common stock in the form of stock options and stock units (i.e., restricted stock units, which we refer to as
“RSUs” and performance stock units, which we refer to as “PSUs”). Our executive officers hold options,
RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock based on service over a
time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard
common stock ranging from 0 to 125% (and, in some cases, up to 250%) of the target number of shares based
on both service over a time-based vesting schedule and achievement of specified performance goals over a
specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold options and RSUs, which represent a right to
receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, subject to vesting requirements of the underlying equity
award, on a specified future date or event, such as a separation from service. The merger agreement provides
for the treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity awards:

Stock Options
Each outstanding option to purchase Activision Blizzard common stock granted pursuant to our
equity incentive plans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, or (ii) will become
vested by its terms at the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration for each share of Activision Blizzard common stock that would have been
issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the effective time, less the applicable
option exercise price for each such share of Activision Blizzard common stock underlying such option
and any applicable withholding taxes.
Each option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, and is not cancelled and
converted as described above, and has an exercise price per share of Activision Blizzard common
stock that is less than the merger consideration, will be, as of the effective time and as determined by
Microsoft, (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a nonqualified stock option or (y) converted
into a nonqualified stock option granted pursuant to Microsoft’s equity incentive plans, in either
case, in respect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
subject to such assumed option as of immediately prior to the effective time (determined based on
target performance levels, as applicable) multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the
merger consideration and (B) the denominator of which is Microsoft’s stock price (i.e., the volume
weighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above
rounded up) of common stock of Microsoft on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending
with the last trading day ending immediately prior to the closing date) (which we refer to as the
“exchange ratio”), at an exercise price per share of common stock of Microsoft equal to (i) the exercise
price of such option divided by (ii) the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. In each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this
paragraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting and exercisability will remain the same with
respect to Activision Blizzard options subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to Activision
Blizzard options subject to performance-based vesting, will be converted into time-based vesting
options (determined based on target performance levels) that will vest at the conclusion of the
original performance period.
In the event that the exercise price per share under any option is equal to or greater than the merger
consideration, such option will be cancelled as of the effective time without payment therefor and will
have no further force or effect.
Stock Units
Each outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs granted pursuant to Activision Blizzard’s equity incentive
plans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) will become vested by its terms
at the effective time or (iii) is granted to a non-employee member of the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors, will, as of the effective time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to such award,
less any applicable withholding taxes.
Each outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time and is not cancelled and converted as described above, will, as of the effective time, be, as
determined by Microsoft, (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a stock-based award or (y)
converted into a stock-based award pursuant to Microsoft’s equity incentive plans, in either case, in
respect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to
such award as of immediately prior to the effective time (determined based on target performance
levels, as applicable) multiplied by the exchange ratio. In each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this
paragraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting will remain the same with respect to equity
awards subject to time-based vesting, and, with respect to equity awards subject to performance-
based vesting, will be converted into time-based vesting equity awards (determined based on target
performance levels) that will vest at the conclusion of the original performance period.

Notwithstanding the treatment of outstanding unvested options, RSUs and PSUs described above, prior to
the closing date, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards that would otherwise be converted as
set forth herein as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and converting an award into the right to receive
the merger consideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to the
award (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of options), less any applicable withholding taxes;
provided that for options, such election may apply only to those options that are otherwise scheduled to

If the treatment described above of an award of stock units or options held by a non-U.S. employee would be
prohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the

compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have been
provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would not

Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the Merger (page 59)
When considering the recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that you vote to
approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our non-employee directors
and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your
interests as a stockholder. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware of and considered these
interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing
the negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and in
recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Activision Blizzard.

Appraisal Rights (page 101)
Any shares of Activision Blizzard common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time and as to which the holders thereof have not voted in favor of the merger proposal and are
entitled to demand, and properly demand, appraisal of such shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the effective time, have neither failed to perfect, nor
effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL, such shares we collectively refer to as the
“dissenting shares,” will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, unless and until
such holder will have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s right to appraisal under the DGCL, or if a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, at which time such shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will be treated as if they had
been converted into the right to receive, as of the effective time, the merger consideration, less applicable tax
withholdings upon surrender of such certificates or book-entry shares that formerly represented such shares
of Activision Blizzard common stock, and such Activision Blizzard common stock will not be deemed
dissenting shares, and such holder thereof will cease to have any other rights with respect to such
Activision Blizzard common stock. Each holder of dissenting shares will only be entitled to such
consideration as may be due with respect to such dissenting shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to Activision Blizzard
before the vote is taken on the merger proposal, you must not submit a blank proxy or otherwise vote in
favor of the merger proposal and you must continue to hold the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
of record through the effective time. Your failure to follow the procedures specified under the DGCL may
result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are
described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal
rights is reproduced and attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Activision
Blizzard common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights,
you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures

and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your
interests as a stockholder. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware of and considered these
interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing
the negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and in
recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Activision Blizzard.

Any shares of Activision Blizzard common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time and as to which the holders thereof have not voted in favor of the merger proposal and are
entitled to demand, and properly demand, appraisal of such shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the effective time, have neither failed to perfect, nor
effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL, such shares we collectively refer to as the
“dissenting shares,” will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, unless and until
such holder will have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s right to appraisal under the DGCL, or if a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, at which time such shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will be treated as if they had
been converted into the right to receive, as of the effective time, the merger consideration, less applicable tax
withholdings upon surrender of such certificates or book-entry shares that formerly represented such shares
of Activision Blizzard common stock, and such Activision Blizzard common stock will not be deemed
dissenting shares, and such holder thereof will cease to have any other rights with respect to such
Activision Blizzard common stock. Each holder of dissenting shares will only be entitled to such
consideration as may be due with respect to such dissenting shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to Activision Blizzard
before the vote is taken on the merger proposal, you must not submit a blank proxy or otherwise vote in
favor of the merger proposal and you must continue to hold the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
of record through the effective time. Your failure to follow the procedures specified under the DGCL may
result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are
described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal
rights is reproduced and attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Activision
Blizzard common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights,
you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures

for the making of a demand for appraisal by such broker, bank or other nominee. Stockholders should refer to
the discussion under the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 101 and the DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights reproduced and attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.",19,20

the Merger” beginning on page 67 of this proxy statement) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of

surrendered in the merger.

Activision Blizzard, Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-00339 (D. Del.). The complaints each assert violations of Section
14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed in
connection with the proposed transaction between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft omitted certain
purportedly material information which rendered the preliminary proxy statement incomplete and misleading.
Specifically, the complaints allege that the preliminary proxy statement failed to disclose material information
regarding the sales process, Activision Blizzard’s projections and the financial analyses of Activision
Blizzard’s financial advisor. The complaints seek, among other things, an order to enjoin the transaction
unless and until additional disclosures are issued; and, if the transaction closes, damages. The Watson
complaint also alleges that Activision Blizzard’s directors entered into the transaction for self-interested
reasons, including receipt of personal benefits in the transaction. It is possible additional lawsuits against
Activision Blizzard, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors or Activision Blizzard’s officers may be filed
prior to the consummation of the transaction.
Following the announcement of the transaction, Activision Blizzard also received demands from purported
stockholders for books and records pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220. Among other things, the
9 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
demands seek to investigate purported breaches of fiduciary duty related to the proposed transaction.
Specifically, the demands seek to investigate Mr. Kotick’s role in the proposed transaction with one of the
demands alleging that Mr. Kotick’s position at Activision Blizzard was at risk given workplace issues and he
chose to pursue a transaction rather than resign. Such demand further alleges that Mr. Kotick agreed to a
price range without authorization from the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors and that the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors allowed Mr. Kotick to control the transaction process. Such demand also alleges
that the transaction price is inadequate because Microsoft’s opportunistic offer took advantage of
Activision Blizzard’s purportedly depressed stock price and that management may have attempted to
validate the consideration through downward adjustments to the Long-Range Plan (as defined under the
section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger -
Background of the Merger”).

the merger, the merger agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all
questions that may be important to you as an Activision Blizzard stockholder. We encourage you to read
carefully the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this
proxy statement (including the merger agreement) and the documents we incorporate by reference in this
proxy statement. You may obtain the documents and information incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement without charge by following the instructions under the section entitled “Where You Can Find
More Information” beginning on page 109. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference herein. Important qualifications with respect to the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements included in the merger agreement are set forth in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 74.
Why am I receiving these proxy materials?
On January 18, 2022, Activision Blizzard entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of
Sub with and into Activision Blizzard, with Activision Blizzard surviving the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Microsoft. In order to complete the merger, Activision Blizzard stockholders must vote to
adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. The approval of this proposal by our stockholders is
a condition to the consummation of the merger. For more information, see the section entitled “Terms of
the Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” beginning on page 89. The Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of
Activision Blizzard common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies in favor of the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement and to approve the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting
or any adjournments or postponements thereof. This proxy statement includes information that we are
required to provide to you under the rules of the SEC and is designed to assist you in voting on the
matters presented at the special meeting. Stockholders of record as of the close of business on March
14, 2022, which we refer to as the “record date,” may attend the special meeting and are entitled and
requested to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement.
What is included in the proxy materials?
The proxy materials include the proxy statement and the annexes to the proxy statement, including the
merger agreement, and a proxy card or voting instruction form.
When and where is the special meeting?
The special meeting will take place on April 28, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time. Due to the public health
impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and to support the well-being of our employees and stockholders,
Activision Blizzard will hold the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the meeting website. The
virtual meeting will provide stockholders with the same rights and opportunities to participate as they
would have at a physical meeting. After registering at http://www.viewproxy.com/​atvism/2022, you will
receive a meeting invitation by email with your unique join link along with a password prior to the
meeting date. You will not be able to attend the special meeting physically in person.
What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Activision Blizzard?
The proposed merger is the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft through the merger of Sub
with and into Activision Blizzard pursuant to the merger agreement. If the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement is approved by the requisite number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock and the
other closing conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, Sub will merge with
and into Activision Blizzard, with Activision Blizzard continuing as the surviving corporation. As a
result of the merger, Activision Blizzard will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft and you
will no longer own shares of Activision Blizzard common stock. Activision Blizzard expects to delist its
common stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the effective time and deregister its common
stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. Thereafter, Activision
Blizzard will no longer be a publicly traded company.

What will I receive if the merger is completed?
Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration of
$95.00 in cash, without interest and less applicable tax withholdings, for each share of Activision
Blizzard common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and perfected and not
withdrawn your demand for, or otherwise lost your, appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to
such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, you will receive
$9,500.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, in exchange for your
shares of Activision Blizzard common stock. In no case will you own shares in the surviving
corporation.
Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
If your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock are registered in your name in the records of our
transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, which we refer to as “Broadridge,” as of the
close of business on the record date, you are a “stockholder of record” for purposes of the special
meeting and are eligible to attend and vote. If you hold shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
indirectly through a broker, bank or similar institution, you are not a stockholder of record, but instead
hold your shares in “street name” and the record owner of your shares is your broker, bank or similar
institution. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name are described under the question
“How do I vote my shares?” below.
How many votes do I have?
You will have one vote for each share of Activision Blizzard common stock owned by you, as a
stockholder of record or in street name, as of the close of business on the record date.
May I attend the special meeting?
Yes. Subject to the requirements described in this proxy statement, all Activision Blizzard stockholders
as of the close of business on the record date may attend the special meeting virtually via the Internet
at the meeting website and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you sign and return a proxy card.
After registering at http://www.viewproxy.com/atvism/2022, you will receive a meeting invitation by
email with your unique join link along with a password prior to the meeting date. If you are a
stockholder of record, you will need your assigned virtual control number to vote shares electronically
at the special meeting. The control number can be found on your enclosed proxy card.
To ensure that your shares will be represented at the special meeting, we encourage you to grant your
proxy in advance electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the
enclosed proxy card), or sign, date, complete and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope. If you attend the special meeting and complete a virtual ballot, your vote will
revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you hold your shares in “street name,” because you are not
the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the special meeting unless you request and
obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.
What if during the check-in time or during the meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the
virtual meeting website?
Please be sure to check in by 8:30 a.m., Pacific time, on April 28, 2022, the day of the special meeting, so
that any technical difficulties may be addressed before the special meeting begins. If you encounter any
difficulties accessing the virtual meeting during the check-in or meeting time, please email

the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of
Activision Blizzard and (iv) recommended that Activision Blizzard stockholders adopt the merger
agreement.
How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of Activision Blizzard common stock
prior to the date on which the transaction was announced?
The per share merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 45.3% to Activision
Blizzard’s closing stock price on January 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the
merger and approximately 50.3% to the volume weighted average stock price of Activision Blizzard
common stock during the 30 trading days ended January 14, 2022.
Will Activision Blizzard pay a dividend before the completion of the merger?
Under the terms of the merger agreement, from January 18, 2022 until the effective time, Activision
Blizzard is permitted to declare and pay one regular cash dividend in an amount not to exceed $0.47 per
share of Activision Blizzard common stock and consistent with the declaration, record and payment date
of Activision Blizzard’s dividend from Activision Blizzard’s most recent fiscal year. Otherwise, during
such time, Activision Blizzard may not declare, set aside, authorize, establish a record date for or pay
any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, shares or property or any combination thereof) in
respect of any shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interest, or make any other actual,
constructive or deemed distribution in respect of the shares of capital stock or other equity or voting
interest, without Microsoft’s prior written consent. See the section entitled “Terms of the Merger
Agreement - Conduct of Business Pending the Merger” beginning on page 81.
On February 3, 2022, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors declared the regular cash dividend of
$0.47 per share of Activision Blizzard outstanding common stock permitted under the terms of the
merger agreement, payable on May 6, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on April
15, 2022.

Does Microsoft have the financial resources to complete the merger?
Yes. Microsoft has represented to Activision Blizzard that it has available and will have available at the
effective time the funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger consideration, including (i) payments to
Activision Blizzard’s stockholders of the amounts due under the merger agreement and (ii) payments in
respect of certain of Activision Blizzard’s outstanding equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement.
For a more complete description of sources of funding for the merger and related costs, see “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement - Financing of the Merger” beginning on page 67.
What do I need to do now?
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement (including the
merger agreement) and the documents we refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the
merger affects you. Then, grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or complete,
sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid
reply envelope, so that your shares can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in
“street name,” please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other
nominee to vote your shares.
How do I vote my shares?
For stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the special meeting and are a stockholder of
record, you may submit your proxy or cast your vote in any of four ways:
By Internet - If you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy by following the instructions
provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card. Proxies submitted via Internet must be
received by 8:59 p.m., Pacific time, on April 27, 2022.
By Telephone - You can also submit your proxy by telephone by following the instructions provided
with your proxy materials and on your proxy card. Proxies submitted via telephone must be received
by 8:59 p.m., Pacific time, on April 27, 2022.
By Mail - You may submit your proxy by completing the proxy card enclosed with these materials,
signing and dating it and returning it in the prepaid envelope we have provided.
By Virtual Ballot - You may attend the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the meeting website
and complete a virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: If you hold your shares in street name and, therefore, are not a stockholder
of record, you will need to follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by your broker, bank
or other nominee. If you wish to vote your shares by virtual ballot at our special meeting, you must
obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or similar institution, granting you authorization to
vote your shares.
If you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your
proxy, your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will be voted in accordance with your
instructions.
Even if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your
shares of Activision Blizzard common stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain
a valid legal proxy to vote shares which you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock by virtual ballot at the special meeting even if you have previously
authorized your vote by proxy. If you are present at the special meeting and vote by virtual ballot, your
previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
Can I change or revoke my proxy?
For stockholders of record: Yes. A proxy may be changed or revoked at any time prior to its exercise at
the special meeting by submitting a later-dated proxy (including a proxy submitted via the Internet or by
telephone) or by giving written notice to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at

Activision Blizzard, Inc., 2701 Olympic Boulevard, Building B, Santa Monica, CA 90404. You may not
change your vote over the Internet or by telephone after 8:59 p.m., Pacific time, on April 27, 2022. You
may also attend the special meeting and vote your shares by virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: Yes. You must follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by
your broker, bank or other nominee to change or revoke any instructions you have already provided to
them.
How will my shares be voted if I do not provide specific instructions in the proxy card or voting instruction form
that I submit?
If you are a stockholder of record and if you sign, date and return your proxy card but do not provide
specific voting instructions, your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will be voted “FOR” the
merger proposal, “FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment
proposal.
If your shares are held in street name at a broker, bank or similar institution, your broker, bank or similar
institution may, under certain circumstances, vote your shares on “discretionary” matters if you do not
timely provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions provided by them. However, if
you do not provide timely instructions, your broker, bank or similar institution does not have the
authority to vote on any “non-discretionary” proposals at the special meeting and a “broker non-vote”
would occur, as explained in the following question and explanation.
What is “broker discretionary voting”?
If you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee may be able to vote your
shares without your instructions depending on whether the matter being voted on is “discretionary” or
“non-discretionary.” Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have
discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals, if a beneficial owner of shares
of Activision Blizzard common stock does not give voting instructions to the applicable broker, bank or
other nominee with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting. If there are any broker non-votes, then such broker non-
votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal, but will not have any effect
on the merger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal (assuming there is a quorum).
Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote
your shares.
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the special meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum
at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 780,922,900 shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. If you submit a properly executed
proxy by mail, telephone or the Internet, or attend the special meeting, you will be considered a part of
the quorum. In addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-
votes will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. As a result, 390,461,451 shares must be
represented, in person or by proxy, to have a quorum. In the event that a quorum is present at the
special meeting and there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
merger proposal, it is expected that the special meeting would be adjourned to allow time to solicit
additional proxies if the holders of a majority of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled
to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, approve an adjournment. If a quorum is not present,
the special meeting may be (and it is expected that the special meeting would be) adjourned by the
presiding person of the meeting pursuant to the authority granted in Activision Blizzard’s bylaws until a
quorum is obtained, subject to the terms of the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the annual meeting?
The merger proposal: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Activision
Blizzard common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the merger
proposal. This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” that
proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of the votes that can be cast as of the record date in
respect of outstanding shares of Activision Blizzard common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
The merger-related compensation proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the
shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy,
provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the
merger-related compensation proposal. This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of
shares voted “FOR” that proposal is greater than 50% of the shares of Activision Blizzard common
stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present.
Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger-related compensation proposal,
and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal (assuming a
quorum is present).
The adjournment proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, provided a
quorum is present, is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting. Whether or not
there is a quorum, the presiding person at the special meeting has the power to adjourn the special
meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the adjournment proposal, and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the
adjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).
How can I obtain a proxy card or voting instruction form?
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card or a voting instruction form, please follow
the applicable procedure below.
For stockholders of record: Please contact our proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 687-
1871 from the U.S. or Canada or at +1 (412) 232-3651 from other locations.
For holders in street name: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other
nominee.
Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may become
payable by Activision Blizzard to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
SEC rules require Activision Blizzard to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation
that will or may become payable by Activision Blizzard to its named executive officers in connection
with the merger.
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Activision Blizzard to its named executive officers
in connection with the merger for purposes of this advisory vote?
The compensation that will or may become payable by Activision Blizzard to its named executive
officers in connection with the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and
payable to certain of Activision Blizzard’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and
arrangements that are contractual in nature, including amounts payable in accordance with the terms of
the merger agreement. Compensation that will or may become payable by Microsoft to Activision
Blizzard’s named executive officers in connection with the merger is not subject to this advisory vote.
For further detail, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 2: Advisory Vote on Merger-
Related Executive Compensation Arrangements” beginning on page 95.
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
No. After the merger is completed, under the terms of the merger agreement, you will receive shortly
thereafter the letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificates or surrender your
book-entry shares to the paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the merger consideration
for

each share of your Activision Blizzard common stock represented by the stock certificates or book-entry
shares. You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment
to which you are entitled upon completion of the merger. Please do not send in your stock certificates
now.
I do not know where my stock certificates are. How will I get the merger consideration for my shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock?
If the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger
will include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificates. This will
include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may
also be required to post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Activision Blizzard common stock after the close of
business on the record date but before the special meeting?
The record date is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date the merger is expected to be
completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock after the close of
business on the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your
shares and each of you notifies Activision Blizzard by giving written notice to our Corporate Secretary
at our principal executive offices at Activision Blizzard, Inc., 2701 Olympic Boulevard, Building B, Santa
Monica, CA 90404 of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share
merger consideration if the merger is completed to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares
of Activision Blizzard common stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares at the special
meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock after the
close of business on the record date, we encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed
proxy card or vote via the Internet or telephone.
When do you expect the merger to be completed?
We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete
the merger in Microsoft’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of
the merger cannot be predicted because the completion of the merger is subject to conditions, including
the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals.
What happens if the merger is not completed?
If the merger agreement is not adopted by Activision Blizzard stockholders or if the merger is not
completed for any other reason, Activision Blizzard stockholders will not receive any payment for their
shares of Activision Blizzard common stock. Instead, Activision Blizzard will remain an independent
public company, Activision Blizzard common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and
registered under the Exchange Act, and Activision Blizzard will continue to file periodic reports with the
SEC.
Under certain specified circumstances, Activision Blizzard will be required to pay Microsoft a
termination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled
“Terms of the Merger Agreement - Termination Fee” beginning on page 92.
Under certain specified circumstances, Microsoft will be required to pay Activision Blizzard a reverse
termination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled
“Terms of the Merger Agreement - Reverse Termination Fee” beginning on page 93.
Are there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the merger. See the section
entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 24.

Do any of Activision Blizzard’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of
Activision Blizzard stockholders generally?
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors with respect to the

have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Activision Blizzard
stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, (ii) approving the merger

agreement and the merger and (iii) unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by
Activision Blizzard stockholders, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware of and
considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For a
description of the interests of Activision Blizzard’s directors and executive officers in the merger, see
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - Interests of the Non-Employee Directors
and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the Merger” beginning on page 59.
What happens if the merger-related compensation proposal is not approved?
Approval of the merger-related compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger.
The vote is an advisory vote and is not binding. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory
vote, if the merger is completed, Activision Blizzard may still pay such compensation to its named
executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement
and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms. For example, if you hold your shares in more than
one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account
in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than
one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, date, sign and return (or vote via
the Internet or telephone with respect to) each proxy card and voting instruction form that you receive.
Who counts the votes?
Votes are counted by American Election Services, LLC, which we refer to as “AES,” and are then
certified by a representative of AES appointed by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors to serve as
the inspector of election at the special meeting.
Who may attend the special meeting?
Activision Blizzard stockholders who held shares of Activision Blizzard common stock as of the close of
business on March 14, 2022.
Who pays for the expenses of this proxy solicitation?
Activision Blizzard will bear the entire cost of this proxy solicitation, including the preparation, printing,
mailing and distribution of these proxy materials. We may also reimburse brokerage firms and other
persons representing stockholders who hold their shares in street name for reasonable expenses
incurred by them in forwarding proxy materials to such stockholders. In addition, certain directors,
officers and other employees, without additional remuneration, may solicit proxies in person or by
telephone, facsimile, email and other methods of electronic communication.
Where can I find the vote results after the special meeting?
We are required to publish final vote results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC
within four business days after our special meeting. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 109.
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Activision Blizzard common stock for cash
pursuant to the merger?
The exchange of Activision Blizzard common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable

transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 67 of this proxy statement) who exchanges shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock for cash in the merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares
and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, see
“Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
of the Merger” beginning on page 67 of this proxy statement.
You should be aware that the tax consequences to you of the merger may depend upon your own situation. In
addition, you may be subject to U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws that are not discussed in this proxy
statement. You should therefore consult with your own tax advisor(s) for a full understanding of the tax
consequences to you of the merger.
What will the holders of outstanding Activision Blizzard equity awards receive in the merger?
For information regarding the treatment of Activision Blizzard’s outstanding equity awards, see the
section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Treatment of Equity
Compensation” beginning on page 75.
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
If the merger agreement is adopted by Activision Blizzard’s stockholders, stockholders who do not vote
(whether in person or by proxy) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly
exercise and perfect their demand for appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in
connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of Activision
Blizzard common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Activision Blizzard
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as
determined by the court, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders who wish
to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with
respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. Stockholders
should refer to the discussion under the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 101 and
the DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights reproduced and attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement.
What is “householding”?
Some banks, brokers and similar institutions may be participating in the practice of “householding”

payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be

If the merger agreement is not adopted by Activision Blizzard stockholders or if the merger is not completed

Activision Blizzard common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the
Exchange Act and Activision Blizzard will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Furthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger
not to be consummated, it is likely that the price of Activision Blizzard common stock will decline
significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Activision Blizzard common stock
would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock. If the merger is not
consummated, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Activision
Blizzard’s business operations, assets and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are
deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the merger agreement is not
adopted by Activision Blizzard stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, there
can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Activision Blizzard or its stockholders will be
offered or that Activision Blizzard’s business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely
impacted.

of $2,270,100,000 upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled

The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors and senior management team regularly review Activision
Blizzard’s performance, future growth prospects and overall strategic direction and consider potential
opportunities to strengthen Activision Blizzard’s business and enhance stockholder value. These reviews
have included consideration of whether the continued execution of Activision Blizzard’s strategy or possible
strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, dispositions, commercial partnerships or combinations with
third parties, offered the best avenue to maximize stockholder value. In addition, the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors and senior management from time to time have been approached by third parties
expressing an interest in exploring a potential strategic combination with or acquisition of Activision
Blizzard, but, since the reduction of Vivendi’s ownership stake in Activision Blizzard in 2013, no such
discussions have advanced beyond preliminary discussions gauging each party’s respective interest in
pursuing a transaction or resulted in any specific proposal on price, structure or other material terms.
For over 20 years, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft have maintained an ongoing commercial relationship.
While the companies have certain commercial arrangements relating to the licensing of various products and
services, their principal business relationship relates to the publishing of products and services for the Xbox
gaming platform. This relationship began over 20 years ago, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive officer of
Activision Blizzard, and Phil Spencer, the chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming, maintain a regular
dialogue about the commercial relationship and the gaming industry generally. From time to time, Satya
Nadella, the chief executive officer of Microsoft, and Mr. Kotick have also spoken about similar matters.
On November 19, 2021, in the course of a conversation on a different topic between Mr. Spencer and Mr.
Kotick, Mr. Spencer raised that Microsoft was interested in discussing strategic opportunities between
Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and asked whether it would be possible to have a call with Mr. Nadella the
following day. Mr. Kotick agreed to participate in such discussion. Following this call, Mr. Kotick promptly
reported the conversation to Robert Morgado, the lead independent director on the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors, and Brian Kelly, the chairman of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. Messrs.
Kotick and Kelly subsequently spoke with Allen & Company LLC, which we refer to as “Allen & Company,”
which had provided strategic financial advice to Activision Blizzard on other occasions, regarding the call
with Mr. Spencer.
In a call on November 20, 2021, between Messrs. Kotick and Nadella, Mr. Nadella indicated that Microsoft
was interested in exploring a strategic combination with Activision Blizzard. Following this call, Mr. Kotick
promptly discussed the call with Messrs. Morgado and Kelly and, thereafter, with a representative of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, outside legal counsel to Activision Blizzard, which we refer to as
“Skadden.”
On November 22, 2021, a call was held with Messrs. Spencer, Kotick and Kelly, during which call Mr. Spencer
noted that, while Microsoft already had a significant amount of information about Activision Blizzard and its
business as a result of the commercial relationship between the companies, Microsoft would need additional
information regarding Activision Blizzard’s long-range financial plan and prospects in order to advance its
analysis. Subsequently, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly indicated to Mr. Spencer that Activision Blizzard was not
willing to provide such information without an indication of the proposal that Microsoft would be prepared
to make that could then be shared with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors to gauge the Board’s level
of interest in engaging in additional discussions. Following this call, Robert Corti, chair of the Audit
Committee of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, was also informed of Microsoft’s expressed interest
in potentially pursuing a transaction.
On November 26, 2021, Mr. Spencer again spoke with Messrs. Kotick and Kelly, indicating that, based on the
information available to Microsoft, Microsoft was preliminarily considering making an all-cash acquisition
proposal for Activision Blizzard at $80.00 per share. Thereafter, Messrs. Kotick, Kelly, Corti and Morgado
discussed potential ranges at which the full Activision Blizzard Board of Directors may be willing to consider
an acquisition proposal taking into consideration, among other factors, Activision Blizzard’s historical
trading prices, selected research analysts’ estimates for Activision Blizzard and relative trading multiples of
Activision Blizzard and its peers.
32 TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 28, 2021, based on discussions with Messrs. Kelly, Corti and Morgado, Mr. Kotick
communicated to Mr. Spencer that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors might be willing to entertain a
proposal, and potentially to engage in discussions relating to a potential strategic combination, if Microsoft
was prepared to propose a transaction in a range of $90.00-$105.00 per Activision Blizzard share, rather than
the $80.00 per share valuation that Mr. Spencer had indicated.
Following that discussion, on November 29, 2021, Mr. Spencer communicated to Messrs. Kotick and Kelly
that Microsoft was willing to negotiate a potential transaction within the $90.00-$105.00 per share range,
albeit noting that Microsoft would be more comfortable at the lower end of the range. Mr. Spencer also noted
a desire to move quickly in advance of a previously scheduled near-term meeting of Microsoft’s board of
directors at which Mr. Spencer wished to discuss the potential transaction between Microsoft and
Activision Blizzard. Following this discussion, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly reported the call to Mr. Morgado
and Mr. Corti as well as to Hendrik Hartong III and Peter Nolan, the remaining members of the Audit
Committee of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors.
On December 1, 2021, Mr. Kotick spoke with Mr. Spencer regarding introductions between the parties’
respective legal teams and potential financial advisors, as well as timing of Activision Blizzard’s delivery of
the Long-Range Plan (as defined below) following execution of a mutual non-disclosure agreement and
scheduling of a meeting between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft executives to discuss the Long-Range
Plan.
On December 3, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, Sard Verbinnen
& Co., Activision Blizzard’s strategic communications firm, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, which
we refer to as “WilmerHale,” and Skadden, in attendance for portions of the meeting. At the meeting,
following the departure of the representatives of Sard Verbinnen & Co., Mr. Morgado provided an update to
the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on the discussions with representatives of Microsoft regarding a
potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. Following the departure of the representatives of
Allen & Company, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed the potential formal engagement of
financial advisors to assist Activision Blizzard in connection with a potential transaction with Microsoft and
other potential alternatives available to Activision Blizzard. After discussing the relevant experience and
qualifications of various potential financial advisors, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors decided to
work with Allen & Company. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors selected Allen & Company on the
basis of, among other factors, Allen & Company’s qualifications and reputation, extensive experience in
advising software companies in connection with potential strategic transactions (including in which
Microsoft was a counterparty), its knowledge and understanding of Activision Blizzard’s business and
industry from its previous work with Activision Blizzard, and the absence of any known material conflicts
with respect to Microsoft.
At the same meeting, a representative of Skadden discussed the directors’ fiduciary duties in the context of
considering a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard and various considerations that should be included
in the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ decision-making process. The Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors, senior management and representatives of Skadden then discussed the potential process the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors might pursue in exploring a potential strategic transaction with
Microsoft or other companies potentially interested in and capable of undertaking a strategic transaction
with Activision Blizzard, and potential regulatory considerations in connection with any such strategic
transaction.
Later on December 3, 2021, following the conclusion of the meeting of the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors earlier in the day, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly received an unsolicited email from the chief executive
officer of another gaming company, which we refer to as “Company A,” addressed to the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors, expressing interest in exploring a potential strategic transaction with Activision Blizzard,
but without any details regarding the terms of such transaction. Subsequently, Mr. Kotick received an
additional communication from the chief executive officer of Company A, expressing a desire to meet in
person the following week.
On December 6, 2021, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement in
order to facilitate Activision Blizzard sharing with Microsoft certain confidential information,

including at a meeting to be held the following day. Activision Blizzard is not a party or subject to any non-

Individual B (each as defined below), with respect to a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard nor is any
other party subject to any standstill or “don’t-ask, don’t-waive” provision that would inhibit such party from
making a proposal.
Also on December 6, 2021, at the request of Activision Blizzard senior management, in advance of the
meeting scheduled for the following day, Activision Blizzard’s long-range plan (which we refer to as the
“Long-Range Plan”), together with “stretch” goals and objectives of the management teams of Activision
Blizzard’s franchises and business units included as an appendix (as described below), was shared with
representatives of Microsoft, and subsequently shared by Microsoft with representatives of Goldman Sachs
& Co. LLC, Microsoft’s financial advisor, which we refer to as “Goldman Sachs.” The Long-Range Plan was
approved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on November 2, 2021 as the plan to be used for
internal business planning purposes for Activision Blizzard’s performance for its fiscal years 2021 through
2024.
Also on December 6, 2021, Mr. Kelly received an unsolicited email from an individual, who we refer to as
“Individual B,” indicating a desire to explore the potential acquisition of the Company’s Blizzard business
unit or potentially a full (or partial) take-private transaction with unidentified potential co-investors.
On December 7, 2021, a meeting was held between representatives of Activision Blizzard, including Messrs.
Kelly and Kotick and Armin Zerza, chief financial officer of Activision Blizzard, together with representatives
of Allen & Company and Skadden, and representatives of Microsoft, including Mr. Spencer as well as
individuals in the corporate development, finance and legal functions within Microsoft, representatives of
Goldman Sachs and representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, outside legal counsel to Microsoft,
which we refer to as “Simpson.” During the meeting, the representatives of Activision Blizzard discussed
with the representatives of Microsoft the Long-Range Plan and long-term opportunities for Activision
Blizzard’s business. The attendees also discussed various other aspects of Activision Blizzard’s business.
On December 8, 2021, Mr. Spencer informed Mr. Kotick that a potential transaction with Activision Blizzard
was considered at a meeting of Microsoft’s Board of Directors on December 8, 2021, and that, as authorized
by Microsoft’s Board of Directors, Activision Blizzard should expect to receive a proposal from Microsoft for
a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard shortly.
On December 10, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale
and Skadden, in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Kelly provided an update to the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors on the meeting between representatives of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, the conversation
between Messrs. Kotick and Spencer, and the communications with the chief executive officer of Company A
and Individual B. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors then discussed timing and structuring,
regulatory, and process considerations should the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors decide to engage in
further discussions with Microsoft following receipt of a proposal from Microsoft. The Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors also discussed other technology and/or gaming companies that might have interest in
pursuing a transaction with Activision Blizzard, including Company A, as well as Activision Blizzard
continuing on a standalone basis. With respect to such other parties, the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors considered their potential strategic interest, ability to deliver greater value for Activision Blizzard
stockholders than an all-cash proposal from Microsoft, and potential regulatory hurdles in a transaction with
such parties. With respect to Company A, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed, among other
things, that a transaction with Company A would necessarily include a very significant stock component,
which would not be directly comparable to an all-cash transaction, would not likely yield significant cost
synergies and would need to be premised on the belief that the long-term value of the combined company
would achieve greater value than Activision Blizzard’s stand-alone plan. The Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors also discussed the relative size and trading multiples of Activision Blizzard and Company A and the
implications for how a combined company might trade. Allen & Company and Skadden also provided their
respective views to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on such considerations. While noting that it
was unlikely that a transaction with Company A could be as attractive or competitive as an all-cash proposal
from Microsoft, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors determined that, particularly in light of the
anticipated proposal from Microsoft, it would make
34 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
sense for Mr. Kotick to meet with the chief executive officer of Company A and learn the parameters of
Company A’s interest in a potential transaction. Accordingly, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors
directed Mr. Kotick to meet with the chief executive officer of Company A and to report back on the results of
such meeting.
In addition, Mr. Kelly reported to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on the email he received from
Individual B. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed the ability of Individual B to credibly
pursue a transaction of the size and complexity that such a transaction would entail, as well as the disruption
that might ensue were it to become known that Activision Blizzard was exploring strategic alternatives, which
might occur if Activision Blizzard engaged in discussions with Individual B in light of prior dealings between
Activision Blizzard and Individual B. After discussions, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors concluded
that Mr. Kelly should not engage with Individual B unless instructed to do so at a later date.
Later on December 10, 2021, Mr. Spencer requested an additional discussion with Mr. Kotick. Mr. Kotick
consulted with Messrs. Kelly and Morgado and with a representative of Skadden about the potential
transaction prior to the telephone call with Mr. Spencer.
Later that afternoon, on a telephone call among Mr. Kotick, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Spencer, Mr. Spencer informed
Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly that Microsoft would be sending a written non-binding indication of interest to
acquire Activision Blizzard later that evening at a purchase price of $90.00 per share in cash. Messrs. Kotick
and Kelly expressed their disappointment in the proposed price but stated that they would report the
proposal to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors.
Later that evening on Friday, December 10, 2021, a representative of Simpson, on behalf of Microsoft, sent to
a representative of Skadden a non-binding indication of interest to acquire Activision Blizzard for $90.00 per
share in cash, together with a draft exclusivity agreement providing for exclusive discussions with Microsoft
through January 15, 2022. The letter requested a response to the proposal by Monday, December 13, 2021.
On December 12, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale
and Skadden, in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Morgado outlined the terms of the non-binding indication
of interest received from Microsoft and described Messrs. Kotick’s and Kelly’s recent conversations with
Mr. Spencer. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed that in addition to the $90.00 per share
cash purchase price, the indication of interest (i) requested a response by December 13, 2021, (ii) proposed a
period of exclusive negotiation through January 15, 2022 pursuant to the terms of an accompanying
exclusivity agreement, (iii) stated that the transaction would be all-cash and not subject to any financing
condition and (iv) noted that Activision Blizzard, post-acquisition, would be led by the Gaming leadership of
Microsoft. Representatives of Allen & Company and Skadden also reported that, in conversations with their
respective counterparty advisors to Microsoft, each had conveyed a desire on the part of Microsoft to move
expeditiously.
At the meeting, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed that, in determining how to respond to
Microsoft’s non-binding indication of interest, it would be helpful for the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors to have a sense of other parties that might be interested in pursuing a transaction with Activision
Blizzard. Allen & Company suggested a number of potential third parties for consideration, including which
of those third parties, in Allen & Company’s view, would likely be most able to acquire Activision Blizzard in
a transaction that could potentially deliver greater value to stockholders of Activision Blizzard than the non-
binding indication of interest received from Microsoft. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed
the potential strategic rationale for a transaction with such third parties, including the potential ability of
each such third party to successfully complete an acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the ability of each such
third party to submit an offer to acquire Activision Blizzard for consideration consisting solely of cash,
equity or a combination of cash and equity, the relative advantages and disadvantages of the form of
consideration in a transaction and tactical considerations with respect to conducting an outreach to such
third parties. Allen & Company indicated that, in its view, Companies C, D and E (each as defined below)
were most likely to be able to acquire Activision Blizzard in a transaction that could potentially deliver
greater value to Activision Blizzard’s stockholders than Microsoft’s proposal.
35 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
At the meeting, Mr. Kotick also provided an update on his communications with the chief executive officer of
Company A, noting that an upcoming meeting had been scheduled for December 14, 2021, and that he would
report back after such meeting.
Also at the meeting, a representative of Skadden provided an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties in
connection with their evaluation of a potential sale of Activision Blizzard in general and Microsoft’s non-
binding indication of interest specifically. In addition, a representative of Skadden discussed with the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors other considerations relating to deal timing and certainty.
The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors also discussed various considerations involved in soliciting third-
party indications of interest in a potential transaction with Activision Blizzard. The Activision Blizzard Board
of Directors discussed the potential benefits of assessing third parties’ interest, including the potential to
obtain a higher value for stockholders from a third party and the potential that increased competition could
result in an increased purchase price and better overall terms for Activision Blizzard from Microsoft in the
event that one or more other parties expressed interest. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors also
discussed the significant downside and disruption that could occur from market rumors regarding
exploratory outreaches, including a potential adverse reaction from Microsoft that could negatively impact
its willingness to proceed with a transaction with Activision Blizzard. In addition, the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors discussed the most effective approach in the event of such outreach, including who
specifically was best positioned to conduct such outreach and attract serious interest. After discussions, the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors authorized and directed Mr. Kotick, along with other members of
Activision Blizzard’s management and/or advisors as needed, to contact Companies C, D and E (each as
defined below) initially, and, in the event of insufficient interest on the part of those three parties, to contact
one other potential strategic counterparty, to gauge interest in a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
At this meeting and in other meetings throughout the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ consideration
of the potential transaction with Microsoft, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors met in executive
session with only non-employee directors, outside counsel and the Secretary of the meeting in attendance to
allow the non-employee directors to confer about the matters discussed at the meeting.
That same day, as authorized by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors at the earlier meeting, Mr. Kotick
contacted the chief executive officer of a potential strategic acquiror, which we refer to as “Company C.” The
chief executive officer of Company C stated that Company C was potentially interested in acquiring
Activision Blizzard. Mr. Kotick subsequently spoke with another senior executive of Company C. The
following day, at Company C’s request and in accordance with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’
directives, representatives of Allen & Company sent to Company C a draft mutual non-disclosure agreement
that had been prepared by Skadden and contained substantially similar terms to those in the non-disclosure
agreement entered into between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft. As described below, Company C
determined not to proceed with a potential transaction involving Activision Blizzard. Accordingly, the mutual
non-disclosure agreement was never negotiated or executed between Activision Blizzard and Company C or
their respective advisors.
Also on December 12, 2021, after the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors meeting authorizing the outreach,
Mr. Kotick contacted the chairperson of the board of a potential strategic acquiror, which we refer to as
“Company D.” The chairperson of the board of Company D stated that Company D was potentially
interested in acquiring Activision Blizzard and that Company D would initially evaluate the viability of a
potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard internally and revert to Mr. Kotick.
The following day, December 13, 2021, Mr. Kotick spoke to the chief executive officer of another potential
strategic acquiror, which we refer to as “Company E,” as authorized by the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors the previous day, regarding Company E’s potential interest in acquiring Activision Blizzard. The
chief executive officer of Company E indicated an interest in a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard,
but expressed concerns regarding the ability to execute a transaction between the parties. The chief
executive officer of Company E stated that Company E would need to further consider internally any
potential business combination. Mr. Kotick also spoke with another senior executive from Company E later
the same day, who indicated that Company E would discuss potential strategic opportunities internally and
revert to Mr. Kotick. A few days later, Mr. Kotick spoke with that senior executive of Company E who
36 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
informed Mr. Kotick that Company E was not in a position to pursue a full acquisition of Activision Blizzard
although Company E would be interested in considering other potential transactions between the parties.
Based on the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ direction that Mr. Kotick not reach out to the fourth
party if there appeared to be potential interest on the part of Company C, Company D and/or Company E, Mr.
Kotick did not reach out to the fourth party pending further developments with Company C, Company D, and
Company E.
Also on December 13, 2021, representatives of Allen & Company received an inquiry from a senior executive
of Company C about a potential transaction with Activision Blizzard. In accordance with the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors’ directives, representatives of Allen & Company followed up with Company C
and communicated to a Company C representative that for an offer to be attractive to Activision Blizzard, it
should be structured as an all-cash acquisition of the entire company and that Company C should be
prepared to move expeditiously.
On December 14, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale
and Skadden, in attendance. Activision Blizzard’s senior management presented to the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors updated financial forecasts regarding Activision Blizzard’s long-term financial
performance for Activision Blizzard’s fiscal years 2021 through 2024, which had been downwardly adjusted
from the Long-Range Plan by Activision Blizzard management to account for, among other things, the
passage of time since the Long-Range Plan was approved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on
November 2, 2021, execution risk in the Long-Range Plan, and further insight into Activision Blizzard’s
performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 - particularly the underperformance of the recently launched “Call
of Duty: Vanguard” and the potential effects of that underperformance in 2022. Senior management noted
that the updated financial forecasts were not intended to constitute a revised Long-Range Plan, and did not
reflect any adjustments that Activision Blizzard might make in its strategy in response to Activision
Blizzard’s performance in the fourth quarter of 2021. Activision Blizzard’s senior management further noted
for the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that, in the ordinary course, Activision Blizzard would assess
its performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 to refresh Activision Blizzard’s outlook for the entirety of 2022,
and would not typically refresh the outlook for years beyond 2022 at this stage of Activision Blizzard’s
typical financial planning process, although it had done so at this time in order to provide the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors with an updated risk-adjusted view of Activision Blizzard’s potential prospective
financial performance as it considered the potential transaction with Microsoft. The Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors then considered and further discussed these updated risk-adjusted financial forecasts.
Following such discussion, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors approved use of such updated risk-
adjusted financial forecasts for purposes of considering the potential transaction with Microsoft.
At the meeting, Mr. Kotick provided an update to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on his
communications with representatives of Company C, Company D and Company E and representatives of
Allen & Company provided an update on their communications with Company C. The Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors discussed the need to further ascertain the interest levels of Company C, Company D and
Company E in a potential transaction and timing considerations in relation to responding to Microsoft’s non-
binding indication of interest in view of Microsoft’s request for a response by December 13, 2021. Also at the
meeting, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed certain information provided by Allen &
Company regarding Allen & Company’s material relationships with Activision Blizzard and Microsoft during
the preceding two-year period as previously provided to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. After
consulting with Activision Blizzard’s legal advisors, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors determined
that, based on such information, there were no material conflicts that would preclude Allen & Company from
continuing to serve as financial advisor to Activision Blizzard.
Later on December 14, 2021, Mr. Kotick met with the chief executive officer of Company A. During the
meeting, the chief executive officer of Company A expressed that a strategic combination between the
companies would be beneficial for both companies and their stockholders, but did not provide a proposal for
a potential transaction. During the meeting, the chief executive officer of Company A did not communicate
any requests to, or propose any specific actions from, Activision Blizzard.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on December 14, 2021, Mr. Spencer spoke with Mr. Kotick to request an update on Activision Blizzard’s
response to Microsoft’s non-binding indication of interest. Following this conversation on December 14,
2021, in accordance with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ directives, representatives of Allen &
Company updated representatives of Goldman Sachs that additional meetings of the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors were planned in advance of Activision Blizzard delivering a response to Microsoft’s non-
binding indication of interest.
On December 15, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale
and Skadden, in attendance. At this meeting, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was provided with
additional financial information relating to Activision Blizzard, including financial forecasts of Activision
Blizzard’s long-term financial performance as extended through fiscal year 2026. Allen & Company provided a
summary of the preliminary proposed terms of Microsoft’s non-binding indication of interest and certain
preliminary financial matters relating to Activision Blizzard based on the updated risk-adjusted financial
forecasts approved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on December 14, 2021, as extended through
fiscal year 2026.
Mr. Kotick provided an update to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on the status of communications
with representatives of Company C, Company D and Company E. Representatives of Allen & Company
provided an update to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on their communications with
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Microsoft’s stated areas of focus in due diligence should the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors authorize continued engagement with Microsoft.
The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed a range of potential alternative responses in
connection with the non-binding indication of interest received from Microsoft and the relative advantages
and disadvantages of a combination with Microsoft compared to other potential counterparties, as well as
continuing on a standalone basis, and also considered additional factors, including, among other things, the
economic and competitive landscape of the current gaming and technology sectors. After discussions, the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors directed Messrs. Kotick and Kelly and representatives of Allen &
Company to convey to Microsoft a request to increase its proposed purchase price from $90.00 per share to
$100.00 per share. At the same time, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors authorized management to
proceed with its negotiations with Microsoft, without the need for further Board authorization, in the event
management was able to increase Microsoft’s proposal to at least $95.00 per share.
Later that day on December 15, 2021, a senior executive of Company C communicated to representatives of
Allen & Company that Company C would not be in a position to proceed with discussing a potential
business combination with Activision Blizzard.
Later that evening on December 15, 2021, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly had a telephone call with Mr. Spencer.
The parties discussed the potential business combination, and, as directed by the Activision Blizzard Board
of Directors, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly requested that Microsoft increase its proposed purchase price to
$100.00 per share. Mr. Spencer noted that further discussion would be required and that he would respond in
the next day or two.
On the morning of December 16, 2021, the chairperson of Company D called Mr. Kotick and communicated
that Company D was interested in potentially exploring an acquisition of Activision Blizzard and would
facilitate a follow-up call with the chief executive officer and other senior executives of Company D to further
discuss.
Also on the morning of December 16, 2021, Mr. Nadella requested a telephone call with Mr. Kotick. During
the call later that morning with Mr. Kotick, Mr. Nadella inquired whether Activision Blizzard would consider a
proposal below the $100.00 per share amount previously communicated to Microsoft. Mr. Kotick suggested
to Mr. Nadella that Microsoft should provide its best and final offer and reiterated that Activision Blizzard
was focused on taking actions that were in the best interests of its stockholders. Mr. Nadella reiterated
Microsoft’s desire to move expeditiously.
Messrs. Kotick and Nadella had a series of telephone calls over the course of December 16, 2021. Mr. Nadella
initially communicated Microsoft’s willingness to increase the price contemplated by Microsoft’s non-
binding indication of interest from $90.00 to $93.00 per share on the condition that Activision
38 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Blizzard grant Microsoft a 30-day exclusivity period. Mr. Kotick informed Mr. Nadella that he was not
authorized to proceed at a price below $95.00 per share, but he was authorized to consider a $95.00 per share
price with a 30-day exclusivity commitment at that price level and also would need an agreement from
Microsoft on certain other key terms, particularly related to a reverse termination fee. Mr. Nadella responded
that he would have to discuss further internally. Subsequently, Mr. Nadella proposed to increase the price
provided for in Microsoft’s non-binding indication of interest to $95.00 per share and expressed willingness
to engage in discussions on whether Microsoft would agree to a reverse termination fee and the quantum of
such fee, as well as other transaction terms, at the appropriate time.
Later in the evening of December 16, 2021, representatives of Skadden sent a markup of the exclusivity
agreement, which included a term sheet, to representatives of Simpson. Subsequently, representatives of
Simpson contacted representatives of Skadden to discuss the exclusivity agreement and term sheet. On a
telephone call, representatives of Skadden conveyed to representatives of Simpson that the term sheet
reflected a number of key deal terms and were the basis upon which the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors would be willing to enter into exclusivity.
Early in the morning of December 17, 2021, representatives of Goldman Sachs called representatives of Allen
& Company to discuss the exclusivity agreement and term sheet circulated by representatives of Skadden to
representatives of Simpson the previous night.
Subsequently on the morning of December 17, 2021, in accordance with the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors’ directives, representatives of Allen & Company called representatives of Goldman Sachs, and
representatives of Skadden called representatives of Simpson, to provide Activision Blizzard’s rationale for
the positions taken in the exclusivity agreement and term sheet circulated by representatives of Skadden.
Also on the morning of December 17, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by
videoconference, with members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen &
Company, WilmerHale and Skadden, in attendance. Mr. Kotick provided an update on his communications
with Messrs. Spencer and Nadella and the provision of the revised exclusivity agreement and term sheet to
representatives of Simpson. Representatives of Allen & Company and Skadden provided an update on their
respective follow-up communications with Goldman Sachs and Simpson regarding the exclusivity agreement
and term sheet. A representative of Skadden provided an overview of the terms of the revised exclusivity
agreement and term sheet to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. The Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors also received an update on the status of the discussions with Company C, Company D and
Company E. Mr. Kotick noted that he had not received at that time any communication from the chief
executive officer of Company D after his discussion with the chairperson of Company D on December 16,
2021, and that Company C and Company E each had indicated that it would not be proceeding with
discussions to acquire Activision Blizzard at that time. After discussions, the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors authorized management to enter into exclusive discussions with Microsoft on the basis of the
$95.00 per share price proposed by Microsoft and on such additional terms as management deemed
appropriate for up to a 30-day period, and directed Activision Blizzard’s management, led by Mr. Kotick, to
continue negotiations with Microsoft.
Later on the morning of Friday, December 17, 2021, the chief executive officer of Company D emailed Mr.
Kotick noting that Company D was keen to engage and explore a potential transaction and introducing other
senior executives from Company D. Mr. Kotick responded to the chief executive officer of Company D
sharing his direct telephone line in order to connect. A follow-up video conference was subsequently
scheduled with such other senior executives for Monday, December 20, 2021.
Later on the morning of December 17, 2021, representatives of Simpson sent representatives of Skadden a
revised exclusivity agreement and term sheet and noted Microsoft’s expectation to sign the exclusivity
agreement as quickly as possible that day.
In the early afternoon on December 17, 2021, Messrs. Kotick and Spencer discussed open points in the term
sheet and overall timing, with Mr. Spencer noting Microsoft’s desire to move expeditiously into exclusivity
that day and the due diligence process.
From the afternoon of December 17, 2021, through the morning of December 20, 2021, representatives of
Skadden and Simpson had multiple calls discussing open points with respect to the exclusivity agreement
39 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
and term sheet, focused on the parameters for a reverse termination fee and other regulatory related
provisions to be included in any definitive agreement in connection with the proposed transaction.
On December 20, 2021, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly, together with a representative of Allen & Company, had a
video conference with senior executives from Company D. Mr. Kotick discussed that Activision Blizzard
could represent an attractive strategic combination for Company D, but explained that circumstances had
changed since he first spoke with Company D’s chairperson and that it now was likely that, very shortly,
Activision Blizzard would not be in a position to engage in additional discussions for some period of time.
Mr. Kotick also suggested that Company D could readily perform due diligence on Activision Blizzard in the
meantime based on publicly available information. The representatives of Company D expressed that
Company D was not prepared to proceed expeditiously on the basis of publicly available information and
implied that Company D would only be interested in relaying an indication of interest if provided with an
opportunity to review confidential information. Following this call, no further discussions were held with
Company D.
Also on December 20, 2021, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly exchanged telephone calls with Mr. Spencer during
which they discussed open issues on the term sheet, including, among other things, the quantum of the
reverse termination fee.
In the evening of December 20, 2021, representatives of Skadden and Simpson exchanged further updated
drafts of the term sheet. Subsequently, in the evening of December 20, 2021, the exclusivity agreement was
executed. The exclusivity agreement included a term sheet specifying the quantum and payment conditions
of the reverse termination fee and other regulatory related provisions to be included in the definitive merger
agreement, if executed.
On December 21, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale
and Skadden, in attendance. Mr. Morgado informed the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that
Activision Blizzard had entered into an exclusivity agreement with Microsoft on the prior evening. A
representative of Skadden described to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors the terms of the exclusivity
agreement, including the non-solicitation and confidentiality restrictions contained therein, and the term
sheet, including the quantum, timing and events triggering the payment of the reverse termination fee by
Microsoft to Activision Blizzard. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed Microsoft’s
anticipated due diligence process and next steps with respect to negotiating a potential acquisition
agreement with Microsoft.
On December 27, 2021, access was provided to representatives of Microsoft and its outside advisors to a
virtual data room hosting Activision Blizzard materials. Microsoft and its advisors engaged in due diligence
from the period of December 27, 2021 through the execution of the merger agreement on January 18, 2022,
which process included a number of videoconference meetings and telephone calls attended by members of
Activision Blizzard senior management, representatives of Activision Blizzard’s outside legal, financial and
accounting advisors, members of Microsoft senior management and representatives of Microsoft’s outside
legal, financial and accounting advisors, as applicable, on various business, financial, tax, accounting and
legal matters.
On December 29, 2021, representatives of Simpson sent an initial draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Skadden. The draft included the following key terms, including regulatory provisions,
most of which were previously provided in the non-binding term sheet: (i) a requirement that Microsoft use
reasonable best efforts to obtain antitrust approvals, but no obligation for Microsoft to agree to any
divestures or limitations on its post-closing business that would (x) have a material adverse impact on
Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (y) (1) have a material impact on the benefits
expected to be derived from the proposed merger by Microsoft or (2) have a more than immaterial impact on
any business or product line of Microsoft; (ii) a termination fee payable by Activision Blizzard to Microsoft
equal to 3.75% of the transaction’s equity value in the event of a termination of the merger agreement in
certain circumstances, including following a change in recommendation by the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors or if Activision Blizzard enters into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior
proposal; (iii) an outside termination date of 12 months from signing, subject to two automatic extensions for
consecutive three-month periods if all conditions to closing are satisfied other than the
40 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
conditions regarding the receipt of regulatory approvals and the lack of any legal injunction (in connection
with regulatory regimes); and (iv) a termination fee payable by Microsoft to Activision Blizzard in the event
of a termination of the merger agreement as a result of a legal injunction (in connection with antitrust
regimes) or the failure to obtain necessary antitrust approvals by the outside termination date (as extended)
if certain conditions are met of (x) $2,000,000,000 if the termination notice is delivered during the first 12
months from signing, (y) $2,500,000,000 if the termination notice is delivered 13 to 15 months from signing
and (z) $3,000,000,000 if the termination notice is delivered after 15 months from signing.
During the weeks of January 3, 2022, and January 10, 2022, Messrs. Kotick and Spencer and respective
members of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft senior management, along with their respective outside legal
advisors, discussed and negotiated certain key open points in the merger agreement, including the quantum
of the termination fee payable by Activision Blizzard, the treatment of employee equity awards, and the
scope of the interim operating covenants, as well as severance and retention matters and due diligence
matters on a number of video and telephone calls.
On January 6, 2022, at the request of Activision Blizzard, representatives of Skadden sent a revised draft of
the merger agreement to representatives of Simpson.
On January 7, 2022, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale
and Skadden, in attendance. Mr. Kotick provided an update on the status of the potential transaction with
Microsoft, including the state of Microsoft’s due diligence, negotiation of the draft merger agreement, and
contacts with representatives of Microsoft. A representative of Skadden provided an update on the status of
the potential transaction from a legal perspective, including Activision Blizzard’s responses to Microsoft’s
due diligence requests, Activision Blizzard’s progress in preparing and providing via a virtual data room
documents responsive to due diligence requests, and due diligence calls between representatives of
Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and their respective advisors.
On January 10, 2022, representatives of Simpson sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to
representatives of Skadden.
On January 11, 2022, in a videoconference with representatives of Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Allen &
Company and members of Activision Blizzard senior management in attendance, Mr. Zerza discussed
Activision Blizzard’s preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. These financial
results were subsequently provided to Microsoft via Activision Blizzard’s data room.
On January 13, 2022, at the request of Activision Blizzard, representatives of Skadden sent a revised draft of
the merger agreement to representatives of Simpson.
On January 14, 2022, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale
and Skadden, in attendance. Members of Activision Blizzard senior management presented to the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors Activision Blizzard’s financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Members of
senior management noted that, as previously discussed with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors,
Activision Blizzard had failed to meet its revenue projections for the fourth quarter of 2021 given the
underperformance of the recently launched “Call of Duty: Vanguard.” Mr. Morgado noted to the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors that Activision Blizzard’s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of
2021 would be incorporated to update the financial forecasts as approved by the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors on December 14, 2021, and shared with Allen & Company for purposes of its financial analysis and
opinion, if and when requested, in connection with the proposed transaction with Microsoft. Certain of these
updated financial forecasts also were shared with Microsoft and its advisors later that day.
Allen & Company then provided the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors with an update on, among other
things, recent developments in the gaming industry, including a recent publicly announced transaction in
such industry and its comparison to the potential transaction with Microsoft. Prior to the meeting, the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors also was provided with certain updated information from Allen &
Company regarding its material relationships with Activision Blizzard and Microsoft during the preceding
two-year period, which information was consistent with the information previously provided.
Representatives

of Skadden then presented on the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties in the context of
considering a change of control transaction and presented a detailed summary of the key terms of the draft
merger agreement, including the structure of the proposed transaction, the consideration to be received by
stockholders of Activision Blizzard of $95.00 per share in cash, the treatment of Activision Blizzard’s equity
awards, certain restrictions on Activision Blizzard’s business and operations during the pendency of the
transaction, proxy statement filing and stockholder meeting requirements, director and officer
indemnification, Microsoft’s regulatory undertakings, the provisions restricting the solicitation of, and
relating to the consideration of unsolicited, alternative acquisition proposals that would apply to Activision
Blizzard and its representatives during the pendency of a transaction, the ability of the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors to change its recommendation, anticipated closing timing, closing conditions and the
termination rights and fees and remedies available to Activision Blizzard and Microsoft in the event the
potential transaction was not consummated, and noted remaining open points. Representatives of Skadden
also presented to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors certain regulatory considerations with respect to
the potential transaction with Microsoft.
On January 14, 2022, at the request of Activision Blizzard, representatives of Skadden delivered an initial
complete draft of Activision Blizzard’s confidential disclosure schedules to the merger agreement, certain
sections of which had been previously provided, to representatives of Simpson.
Between January 14, 2022, and January 18, 2022, representatives of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and
their respective legal advisors had multiple conversations to resolve outstanding matters under the merger
agreement and Activision Blizzard’s confidential disclosure schedules to the merger agreement and
exchanged multiple drafts of the merger agreement and Activision Blizzard’s confidential disclosure
schedules to the merger agreement.
On January 17, 2022, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with
members of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale
and Skadden, in attendance. Representatives of Skadden reviewed the key terms of the merger agreement,
including changes from the terms discussed at the meeting on January 14, 2022, noting that one remaining
open issue was the amount of the 2022 dividend that could be paid by Activision Blizzard and whether
Activision Blizzard would be permitted to pay a dividend in 2023 and, if so, the amount thereof. Also at this
meeting, Allen & Company reviewed with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors its financial analysis of
the merger consideration, and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
January 17, 2022, to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors to the effect that, as of such date and based
on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications
and limitations on the review undertaken as set forth in such opinion, the merger consideration to be
received by holders of Activision Blizzard common stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Microsoft, Sub
and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders. After discussions, including as to the matters described below under “- Recommendation of
the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors; Activision Blizzard’s Reasons for the Merger,” the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors unanimously determined to delegate the final resolution of the dividend issue to
an ad hoc committee of directors of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, consisting of Messrs.
Morgado, Kelly and Corti, and (i) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Activision Blizzard and its
stockholders; (ii) declared advisable, approved and authorized in all respects the execution and delivery of
the merger agreement by Activision Blizzard, the performance by Activision Blizzard of its obligations
thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby upon the terms and conditions
set forth therein; (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting
of the stockholders of Activision Blizzard; and (iv) recommended that Activision Blizzard stockholders adopt
the merger agreement.
Following the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the
merger) by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft finalized the merger
agreement, including the resolution of the outstanding dividend issue, which Mr. Nadella and Mr. Kotick
discussed during the evening of January 17, 2022, and the resolution of which was approved by the ad hoc
committee of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. Early in the morning on January 18, 2022, Activision
Blizzard and Microsoft executed the merger agreement, and, prior to the opening of trading on January 18,
2022, issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors to Adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby Approving
the Transactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
On January 17, 2022, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, after considering various factors described
below, unanimously (i) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Activision Blizzard and its stockholders; (ii)
declared advisable, approved and authorized in all respects the execution and delivery of the merger

stockholders of Activision Blizzard; and (iv) recommended that Activision Blizzard stockholders adopt the
merger agreement.
The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement, thereby approving the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a number of meetings and consulted with Activision Blizzard’s
senior management and legal and financial advisors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement and to recommend that Activision Blizzard stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement, the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including, but not limited to the
following (which are not necessarily presented in order of their relative importance to the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors):
Premium to Market Price. The fact that the merger consideration of $95.00 per share in cash to be
received by the holders of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock in the merger represents a
significant premium over the market price at which shares of Activision Blizzard common stock traded
prior to the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, including the fact that the
merger consideration represents a premium of:
approximately 19.8% over the volume-weighted average closing stock price of shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock for the one-year period ended January 14, 2022;
approximately 45.3% over the closing stock price of Activision Blizzard common stock on
January 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to the approval of the transaction; and
approximately 50.3% over the volume-weighted average stock price of shares of Activision
Blizzard common stock during the 30 trading days ended January 14, 2022.
Form of Consideration. The fact that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, which provides
stockholders certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
while eliminating long-term business and execution risks.
Fair Value. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that the merger represents fair
value for the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, taking into account the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors’ familiarity with Activision Blizzard’s current and historical financial condition,
results of operations, business, competitive position and prospects, as well as Activision Blizzard’s
future business plan and potential long-term value.
Growth Opportunities. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, based on discussions
between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and Microsoft’s transaction history, that Activision
Blizzard’s business will be an important focus of Microsoft’s growth strategy, which would create
professional growth opportunities for many of Activision Blizzard’s employees.
Benefits to Customers. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, based on discussions
between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and Microsoft’s product portfolio and transaction
43 • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
history, that Activision Blizzard’s customers will benefit from Microsoft’s complementary product
offerings and its greater resources and capabilities to expand the business of Activision Blizzard as
part of Microsoft.
Industry Dynamics. The potential for the merger to enhance the combined company’s ability to
compete effectively in the highly competitive market environments in which Activision Blizzard and
Microsoft operate by combining Activision Blizzard’s creative DNA and library of premium franchises
with Microsoft’s technological and distribution capabilities, including the ability to capitalize on new
growth opportunities and to compete for customers and key employee talent.
Loss of Opportunity. The possibility that, if the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors declined to
adopt the merger agreement, there may not be another opportunity for Activision Blizzard’s
stockholders to receive a comparably priced transaction with a comparable level of closing certainty.
Risks Inherent in Activision Blizzard’s Business Plan. Activision Blizzard’s short-term and long-term
financial projections and the perceived challenges and risks associated with Activision Blizzard’s
ability to meet such projections, including Activision Blizzard’s past track record of meeting internal,
long-term projections, the financial results for Activision Blizzard for the year ended December 31,
2021 and the implications of Activision Blizzard’s fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021 for
Activision Blizzard’s outlook for 2022 and subsequent years and the competitive threats facing
Activision Blizzard, as well as the risks and uncertainties described in the “risk factors” and “forward
looking statements” sections of Activision Blizzard’s disclosures filed with the SEC, including the
fact that Activision Blizzard’s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially and
adversely from the projected results.
Company Knowledge. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ knowledge of, and discussions
with Activision Blizzard management regarding, Activision Blizzard’s business, operations, financial
condition, earnings, strategy and future prospects, including Activision Blizzard’s opportunities to
create stockholder value in the future on a standalone basis and potential risks in the execution of
Activision Blizzard’s strategic plan.
Arm’s-Length Negotiations. The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors and Activision
Blizzard’s senior management, in coordination with Activision Blizzard’s legal and financial advisors,
vigorously negotiated on an arm’s-length basis with Microsoft with respect to price and other terms
and conditions of the merger agreement, including obtaining a price increase by Microsoft from its
initial indication of interest at $80.00 per share to a price of $95.00 per share as well as the stated
position of Microsoft that the agreed price was the highest price per share to which Microsoft was
willing to agree.
Derivative Litigation. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ consideration of the potential value
to Activision Blizzard (and derivatively to Activision Blizzard stockholders) of pending derivative
litigation claims that have been brought against the Activision Blizzard’s officers and directors, and,
even assuming such litigation claims had material value, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’
determination that the merger consideration of $95.00 per share provided more than adequate value
for such litigation claims.
Other Potential Strategic Alternatives. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ consideration,
from time to time, with the assistance of Activision Blizzard’s senior management and legal and
financial advisors, of the various potential strategic alternatives available to Activision Blizzard,
including remaining an independent public company and continuing to execute on Activision
Blizzard’s strategic plan and the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ belief that the merger presents
a more favorable opportunity for Activision Blizzard stockholders than the potential value that may
result from remaining a standalone public company or pursuing other potential strategic alternatives.
Board Review of Transaction. The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors met, along with
Activision Blizzard’s senior management and legal and financial advisors, to evaluate and discuss the
structure of the merger and the financial and other terms and conditions of, and other matters related
to, the merger, multiple times between November 26, 2021, which was the date on which Microsoft
first indicated that it would be willing to discuss an acquisition of Activision Blizzard at $80.00 per
share and January 18, 2022, which was the date the merger agreement was signed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Other Strategic Parties. The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors authorized and
directed management to contact three other strategic parties to assess their interest in a potential
acquisition of Activision Blizzard that were viewed, with input from Activision Blizzard’s senior
management and legal and financial advisors, as the most likely potential counterparties that could
transact at a level that could potentially deliver greater value to Activision Blizzard stockholders than
the Microsoft transaction and that could potentially obtain required regulatory approval and that
none of the parties contacted by Activision Blizzard’s management determined to proceed with
substantive discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
Opinion of Activision Blizzard’s Financial Advisor. The opinion, dated January 17, 2022, of Allen &
Company to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view and as of such date, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of Activision Blizzard
common stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Microsoft, Sub and their respective affiliates)
pursuant to the merger agreement, which opinion was based on and subject to the various
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the
review undertaken as set forth in such opinion and is more fully described below in the section
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - Opinion of Activision
Blizzard’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 52.
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that the
provisions of the merger agreement, including the respective representations, warranties and
covenants and termination rights of the parties and termination fees payable by Activision Blizzard,
are reasonable and customary. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors also believed that the terms
of the merger agreement include the most favorable terms reasonably attainable from Microsoft.
Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger; Likelihood of Closing. The fact that the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors considered the reasonable likelihood of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in light of the conditions in the merger agreement
to the obligations of Microsoft, including the exceptions to the events that would constitute a
material adverse effect on Activision Blizzard for purposes of the merger agreement, as well as
Activision Blizzard’s ability to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger
agreement, including to cause the merger to be consummated if all of the conditions to Microsoft’s
obligations to effect the merger closing have been satisfied or waived.
Regulatory Approvals. The fact that the merger agreement requires that Microsoft use its reasonable
best efforts to take certain actions necessary to obtain regulatory clearance and satisfy the regulatory
conditions, including the fact that Microsoft agreed to accept potential remedies in order to obtain
regulatory approval, including Microsoft’s commitment to divest or take other actions with respect to
businesses or assets of Activision Blizzard, unless such additional remedies would reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse impact on Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by Microsoft or
have more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft, and that, if the
merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain antitrust
approvals, Microsoft will be required to pay a reverse termination fee of $2,000,000,000 if the notice
regarding the termination of the merger agreement is delivered during the first 12 months post-
signing, $2,500,000,000 if the notice regarding the termination of the merger agreement is delivered
during months 13 to 15 post-signing, or $3,000,000,000 if the notice regarding the termination of the
merger agreement is delivered after month 15 post-signing. For a more complete description of
Microsoft’s obligations to obtain required regulatory approvals and the reverse termination fee, see
the sections below entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Efforts to Close the Merger” beginning
on page 88 and “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Reverse Termination Fee” beginning on page 93.
The merger agreement also provides an appropriate “termination date” by which time it is reasonable
to expect that the regulatory conditions are likely to be satisfied, which is subject to automatic
extension for certain periods if the regulatory conditions are the only conditions not satisfied or
capable of being satisfied at such time. For a more complete description of the termination date, see
the section below entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement - Termination of the Merger Agreement”
beginning on page 91.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
No Financing Condition. The fact that Microsoft’s representations contained in the merger
agreement include a representation that Microsoft has and will have available at the effective time the
funds necessary for the payment of the aggregate merger consideration and the fact that the merger is
not subject to a financing condition.
Ability to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Takeover Proposals. The fact that, while the merger
agreement prohibits Activision Blizzard from actively soliciting competing bids to acquire it, the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors has rights, under certain circumstances, to engage in
discussions with, and provide information to, third parties submitting unsolicited written takeover
proposals and to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition
agreement that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors determines to be a superior proposal;
provided that Activision Blizzard pays a $2,270,100,000 termination fee. The Activision Blizzard Board
of Directors further considered that the timing of the merger would provide ample opportunity for
such third parties to submit proposals.
Change of Recommendation. The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors has the right to
change its recommendation that Activision Blizzard stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement
in response to a superior proposal or certain intervening events, subject to certain conditions, and
the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors’ view that the termination fee of $2,270,100,000 payable to
Microsoft under certain circumstances is customary and reasonable and would not preclude or deter
a willing and financially capable third party from making an acquisition proposal for an alternative
transaction.
Termination Fee. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that the termination fee of
$2,270,100,000 is reasonable in amount, including in comparison with the range of termination fees in
proportion to equity value payables in comparable third-party transactions considered by the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors.
Retention of Key Employees. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that a retention
program and an enhanced severance plan for certain employees of Activision Blizzard that Activision
Blizzard would be permitted to implement in connection with the merger would help assure the
continuity of management and other key employees, and increase the likelihood of the successful
operation of Activision Blizzard during the period prior to closing.
Appraisal Rights. The availability of appraisal rights with respect to the merger for Activision Blizzard
stockholders who properly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these
stockholders the ability to seek and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the “fair value” of
their shares at the completion of the merger.
In the course of its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors also considered a variety of risks, uncertainties and other potentially negative factors, including
the following (which are not necessarily presented in order of their relative importance to the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors):
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The fact that Activision Blizzard’s
stockholders will lose the opportunity to realize additional potential long-term value through
Activision Blizzard’s successful execution as an independent public company.
Impact of Announcement on Activision Blizzard. The fact that the announcement and pendency of
the merger, or the failure to complete the merger, may result in significant costs to Activision Blizzard
and cause substantial harm to Activision Blizzard’s relationships with its employees (including
making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key management
and other personnel) and its customers, partners, providers and suppliers, particularly in the event
that the merger is not consummated.
Diversion of Management Attention. The substantial time and effort of management required to
consummate the merger, which could disrupt Activision Blizzard’s business operations and may
divert employees’ attention away from Activision Blizzard’s day-to-day operations, and the impact of
such efforts on Activision Blizzard’s business in the event that the merger is not consummated.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Tax Treatment. The fact that the all-cash transaction would be taxable to holders of shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Regulatory Risks. The possibility that regulatory agencies may delay, object to or challenge the
merger or may impose terms and conditions on their approvals that adversely affect the business or
financial results of Activision Blizzard or Microsoft and the fact that Microsoft is not required to
agree to remedies that would reasonably be expected to (x) result in a material adverse impact on
Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) have a material impact on the benefits
expected to be derived from the merger by Microsoft or (z) have more than an immaterial impact on
any business or product line of Microsoft.
Stockholder Approval. The risk that the holders of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock may
not approve the adoption of the merger agreement at the Activision Blizzard special meeting.
Closing Certainty. The fact that there can be no assurance that, even if approved by the holders of
shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, the merger will be completed on the anticipated timeline
or at all.
Pre-Closing Covenants. The restrictions on Activision Blizzard’s conduct of business prior to
completion of the merger contained in the merger agreement, including that Activision Blizzard is
required to conduct its business in the ordinary course of business, subject to specific limitations,
which could delay or prevent Activision Blizzard from pursuing certain business opportunities that
may arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations during the pendency of the merger
without Microsoft’s consent, and the impact of such delay or loss of business opportunities on
Activision Blizzard’s business in the event that the merger is not consummated, including on existing
business and employee relationships.
No Solicitation and Termination Fee. The provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the ability
of Activision Blizzard to solicit or negotiate alternative transactions and that such provisions and the
potential requirement to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $2,270,100,000 may deter a potential
acquirer from proposing an alternative transaction for Activision Blizzard that would provide
Activision Blizzard stockholders with greater value than the merger.
Potential Litigation. The potential for litigation relating to the merger and the associated costs,
burden and inconvenience involved in defending any such proceedings.
Loss of Key Personnel. The risk that, despite retention efforts prior to consummation of the merger,
Activision Blizzard may lose personnel and the impact of such losses during the period prior to the
closing and also in the event that the merger is not consummated.
Transaction Costs. The transaction costs and retention costs to be incurred in connection with the
merger, regardless of whether the merger is completed.
Timing of Closing. The amount of time it could take to complete the merger, including that completion
of the merger depends on factors outside of the control of Activision Blizzard or Microsoft, and the
risk that the pendency of the merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of
the execution of the merger agreement could have an adverse impact on Activision Blizzard, including
its customer, supplier and other business relationships and potentially impact the trading price of its
common stock, and the fact that an extended period of time may exacerbate the impact of other risks
considered by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors described herein.
The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors considered the factors described above as a whole, including
through engaging in discussions with Activision Blizzard’s senior management and legal and financial
advisors. Based on this review and consideration, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors unanimously
concluded that these factors, on balance, supported a determination that the terms of the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Activision
Blizzard and its stockholders, and to make its recommendation to Activision Blizzard stockholders that they
vote to adopt the merger agreement.
In considering the recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that Activision Blizzard
stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement, Activision Blizzard stockholders should be

Activision Blizzard does not, as a matter of course, normally publicly disclose long-term forecasts or internal
projections as to its future performance, revenue, earnings or other results given, among other reasons, the
uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates, including the
difficulty of predicting general economic and market conditions, other than, from time to time, estimated
ranges of certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current year and certain future
years in its regular earnings press releases and other investor materials. However, in connection with the
proposed merger, Activision Blizzard’s management provided certain unaudited prospective financial
information to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors for purposes of considering and evaluating the
merger and the merger agreement and to Activision Blizzard’s financial advisor, Allen & Company. Certain of
such prospective financial information also was shared with Microsoft and its financial advisor in
connection with Microsoft’s due diligence review and discussions regarding the merger. Set forth below is a
summary of the material unaudited prospective financial information provided by the management of
Activision Blizzard in connection with the merger. We refer in this proxy statement to such unaudited
prospective financial information, collectively, as the “prospective financial information.”
The prospective financial information was not prepared with a view to public disclosure and is included in
this proxy statement only because such information was made available as described above. The prospective
financial information was not prepared with a view to compliance with generally accepted accounting
principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC
regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information. The prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is
the responsibility of, Activision Blizzard’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited,
reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying
prospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report
incorporated by reference in this document relates to Activision Blizzard’s previously issued financial
statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.
Although a summary of the prospective financial information is presented with numerical specificity, the
prospective financial information reflects numerous forecasts, variables, assumptions and estimates as to
48 TABLE OF CONTENTS
future events made by management of Activision Blizzard, many of which are difficult to predict and subject
to significant economic and competitive uncertainties beyond Activision Blizzard’s control, that management
of Activision Blizzard believed in good faith were reasonable and supportable at the time the prospective
financial information was prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to, and reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of, the management of Activision Blizzard at the time.
However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future
results nor construed as financial guidance, given the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such
forecasts. The prospective financial information is subjective in many respects and, thus, subject to
interpretation. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the prospective financial
information not to be achieved include general economic, regulatory, market, financial, competitive, seasonal,
cyclical and other conditions, trends and developments, industry performance, accuracy of certain
accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, the ability to
attract and retain highly skilled employees, the ability to execute day-to-day operations and other strategic
initiatives and other factors described or referenced under the section entitled “Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on page 24. Because the prospective financial information covers multiple years,
such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. In addition, the
prospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the
date that it was prepared and does not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that
the prospective financial information will or would be realized, and actual results may be materially better or
worse than those contained in the prospective financial information.
None of Activision Blizzard or its directors, officers, affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any
representation to readers of this proxy statement, and has not made any such representation to Microsoft,
concerning the ultimate performance of Activision Blizzard or the combined company compared to the
prospective financial information. The inclusion of the prospective financial information in this proxy
statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Activision Blizzard or any of its directors,
officers, affiliates, advisors or other representatives that the information is material nor has such information
been included to influence your decision on how to vote on any proposal. The prospective financial
information should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information regarding Activision Blizzard contained in our public filings with the SEC. Financial measures
provided to a board of directors or a financial advisor are excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial
measures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures,
which would otherwise require, among other information, a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure
to a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors or Allen & Company in connection with the merger. Accordingly, a
reconciliation of the financial measures included in the financial projections is not provided.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, ACTIVISION
BLIZZARD DOES NOT INTEND, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY, TO UPDATE OR
OTHERWISE REVISE THE PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES
EXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN
IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT
REALIZED AND EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE PROSPECTIVE
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ARE SHOWN TO BE INAPPROPRIATE.
Long-Range Plan
As part of Activision Blizzard’s ordinary course annual financial planning process, and not in contemplation
of the merger, the Long-Range Plan for Activision Blizzard’s fiscal years 2021 through 2024 was presented by
Activision Blizzard’s management to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on October 28, 2021. The
Long-Range Plan was not prepared or extrapolated for Activision Blizzard’s fiscal years 2025 through 2026. In
connection with the Long-Range Plan process (and as is typical in Activision Blizzard’s annual financial
planning process), the management teams of various Activision Blizzard franchises and business units
provided preliminary inputs regarding estimated financial results of such franchises and business units
based on the “stretch” goals and objectives of such franchises’ and
49 
(1) 
(2) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
business units’ management teams which were aggregated by Activision Blizzard’s management into a
compilation of “bottom-up” franchise and business unit inputs. Activision Blizzard’s management then
applied certain risk assessments and judgments to the franchise and business unit inputs in arriving at the
Long-Range Plan. The Long-Range Plan, as risk-adjusted by Activision Blizzard’s management, was
approved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on November 2, 2021 as the plan to be used for
internal business planning purposes for Activision Blizzard’s performance for the fiscal years 2021 through
2024, as described in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement - The Merger - 
Background of the Merger” beginning on page 32. The Long-Range Plan, which included as an appendix the
pre-risk-adjusted franchise and business unit inputs, was provided to Microsoft on December 6, 2021 and
subsequently shared by Microsoft with Goldman Sachs.
The following table reflects selected metrics (in millions) included in the Long-Range Plan as approved by
the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on November 2, 2021:

Management Forecasts
At meetings of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held on December 14, 2021, and December 15, 2021,
Activision Blizzard’s senior management presented to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors updated
financial forecasts for Activision Blizzard’s long-term financial performance (which we refer to in this proxy
statement as the “December 2021 management forecasts”), which had been extended for fiscal years 2025 and
2026 based on potential Activision Blizzard longer-term initiatives and downwardly adjusted from the Long-
Range Plan for fiscal years 2021 through 2024 by Activision Blizzard’s management to account for, among
other things, the passage of time since the Long-Range Plan was presented to the Activision Blizzard Board
of Directors on October 28, 2021 and approved by Activision Blizzard’s Board of Directors on November 2,
2021, further insight into Activision Blizzard’s performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 - particularly the
underperformance of the recently launched version of Call of Duty and the potential effects of that
underperformance in 2022, and execution risk in the Long-Range Plan. The updated management forecasts
were intended to provide the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors with an updated and risk-adjusted view
of Activision Blizzard’s potential prospective financial performance in light of the foregoing as it considered
the proposed transaction with Microsoft. The updated management forecasts were not intended to, and do
not, constitute a revised Long-Range Plan, and do not reflect any adjustments that Activision Blizzard might
make in its strategy in response to Activision Blizzard’s performance in the fourth quarter of 2021. The
December 2021 management forecasts were subsequently further updated in mid-January 2022, prior to the
approval of the merger agreement by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, to reflect forecasted financial
results of Activision Blizzard for the fourth quarter of 2021 and other immaterial adjustments (which we refer
to in this proxy statement as the “January 2022 forecasts”). On January 14, 2022, the Activision Blizzard
Board of Directors directed Allen & Company to use and rely upon the January 2022 forecasts in connection
with its opinion and related financial analyses summarized under “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement - The Merger -",59,63

Activision Blizzard has engaged Allen & Company as financial advisor to Activision Blizzard in connection
with the merger. In connection with this engagement, Activision Blizzard requested that Allen & Company
render an opinion to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors regarding the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of Activision Blizzard common stock pursuant
to the merger agreement. On January 17, 2022, at a meeting of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held
to evaluate the merger, Allen & Company rendered an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated January 17, 2022, to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors to the effect that, as of
that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken described in its opinion, the merger consideration to
be received by holders of Activision Blizzard common stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Microsoft,
Sub and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders.
The full text of Allen & Company’s written opinion, dated January 17, 2022, which describes the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken,
is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The
description of Allen & Company’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of Allen & Company’s opinion. Allen & Company’s opinion and advisory services were
intended for the benefit and use of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection
with its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any other terms,
aspects or implications of the merger. Allen & Company’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation as to the
course of action that Activision Blizzard (or the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors or any committee thereof)
should pursue in connection with the merger or otherwise address the merits of the underlying decision by Activision
Blizzard to engage in the merger, including in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available
to Activision Blizzard or which Activision Blizzard might engage in or consider. Allen & Company’s opinion does not
constitute advice or a recommendation to any securityholder or other person as to how to vote or act on any matter
relating to the merger or otherwise.
Allen & Company’s opinion reflected and gave effect to Allen & Company’s general familiarity with
Activision Blizzard and the industry in which Activision Blizzard operates as well as information that Allen &
Company received during the course of its assignment, including information provided by the management
of Activision Blizzard in the course of discussions relating to the merger as more fully described below. In
arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company neither conducted a physical inspection of the properties or
facilities of Activision Blizzard or any other entity nor made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the
assets or liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of Activision Blizzard or
any other entity, or conducted any analysis concerning the solvency or fair value of Activision Blizzard or
any other entity. Allen & Company did not investigate, and expressed no opinion or view regarding, any
actual or potential litigation, proceedings or claims involving or impacting Activision Blizzard or any other
entity and Allen & Company assumed, with Activision Blizzard’s consent, that there would be no
developments with respect to any such matters that would be meaningful in any respect to its analyses or
opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company, among other things:
reviewed the financial terms of a draft, dated January 17, 2022, of the merger agreement;
• 
• 
• 
reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Activision
Blizzard, including public filings of Activision Blizzard, and historical market prices for Activision Blizzard
common stock;
reviewed certain financial information relating to Activision Blizzard, including certain internal financial
forecasts, estimates and other financial and operating data relating to Activision Blizzard, provided to or
discussed with Allen & Company by the management of Activision Blizzard;
held discussions with the management of Activision Blizzard relating to the operations, financial condition
and prospects of Activision Blizzard;

TABLE OF CONTENTS
reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available information, including certain stock market data and
financial information, relating to selected companies with businesses that Allen & Company deemed
generally relevant in evaluating Activision Blizzard;
reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial information relating to selected transactions that
Allen & Company deemed generally relevant in evaluating the merger; and
conducted such other financial analyses and investigations as Allen & Company deemed necessary or
appropriate for purposes of its opinion.
In rendering its opinion, Allen & Company relied upon and assumed, with Activision Blizzard’s consent and
without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax,
accounting and other information available to Allen & Company from public sources, provided to or
discussed with Allen & Company by the management and other representatives of Activision Blizzard or
otherwise reviewed by Allen & Company. With respect to the financial forecasts, estimates and other
financial and operating data relating to Activision Blizzard that Allen & Company was directed to utilize for
purposes of its analyses and opinion, Allen & Company was advised by the management of Activision
Blizzard and Allen & Company assumed, at Activision Blizzard’s direction, that such financial forecasts,
estimates and other financial and operating data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management as to, and were a reasonable basis
upon which to evaluate, the future financial and operating performance of Activision Blizzard and the other
matters covered thereby. Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to any financial forecasts,
estimates or other financial or operating data or the assumptions on which they were based.
Allen & Company relied, at Activision Blizzard’s direction, upon the assessments of the management of
Activision Blizzard as to, among other things, (i) the potential impact on Activision Blizzard of certain market,
competitive, macroeconomic, seasonal, cyclical and other conditions, trends and developments in and
prospects for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative policies and matters relating to or otherwise
affecting, the interactive entertainment industry, (ii) existing and new products, franchises and related
intellectual property and other technology of Activision Blizzard (including associated risks), (iii) workforce
matters and related litigation, investigations, consent decrees and other proceedings, including the potential
impact thereof on Activision Blizzard, (iv) implications for Activision Blizzard and its operations of the global
COVID-19 pandemic, and (v) existing and future agreements and arrangements involving, and the ability to
attract, retain and/or replace, key employees and contractors, customers, third-party developers,
manufacturers, distributors and other commercial relationships of Activision Blizzard. With Activision
Blizzard’s consent, Allen & Company assumed that there would be no developments with respect to any
such matters that would have an adverse effect on Activision Blizzard or the merger or that otherwise would
be meaningful in any respect to its analyses or opinion.
Further, Allen & Company’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Allen & Company as of, the date of its
opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion expressed in
Allen & Company’s opinion and that Allen & Company assumed no responsibility for advising any person
of any change in any matter affecting Allen & Company’s opinion or for updating or revising its opinion
based on circumstances or events occurring after the date of such opinion. As the Activision Blizzard Board
of Directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets, the industry in which Activision Blizzard
operates and the securities of Activision Blizzard have experienced and may continue to experience volatility
and Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on
Activision Blizzard or the merger.
Allen & Company assumed, with Activision Blizzard’s consent, that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements,
without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement, and that, in the
course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents, releases,
waivers, decrees and agreements for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any
divestiture or other requirements or remedies, amendments or modifications, would be imposed or occur that
would have an adverse effect on Activision Blizzard or the merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in
any respect to Allen & Company’s analyses or opinion. In addition, Allen & Company assumed, with
53 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Activision Blizzard’s consent, that the final executed merger agreement would not differ from the draft
reviewed by Allen & Company in any respect meaningful to its analyses or opinion.
Allen & Company’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of
such opinion, of the merger consideration (to the extent expressly specified in such opinion), without regard
to individual circumstances of specific holders of Activision Blizzard common stock (whether by virtue of
control, voting, liquidity, contractual arrangements or otherwise) that may distinguish such holders or the
securities of Activision Blizzard held by such holders, and Allen & Company’s opinion did not in any way
address proportionate allocation or relative fairness. Allen & Company’s opinion also did not address any
other terms, aspects or implications of the merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the
merger, any repurchase, payoff or similar transaction, cloud-related agreements or arrangements or any other
agreements, arrangements or understandings entered into in connection with, related to or contemplated by
the merger or otherwise. Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to the fairness, financial or
otherwise, of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation or other consideration payable to
any officers, directors or employees of any party to the merger or any related entities, or any class of such
persons or any other party, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Allen & Company did not
express any opinion or view as to the prices at which Activision Blizzard common stock or any other
securities of Activision Blizzard may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including following
announcement or consummation of the merger. In addition, Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view
with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, as to tax or
other consequences of the merger or otherwise or changes in, or the impact of, accounting standards, tax
and other laws, regulations and governmental and legislative policies affecting Activision Blizzard or the
merger, and Allen & Company relied, at Activision Blizzard’s direction, upon the assessments of
representatives of Activision Blizzard as to such matters. Allen & Company’s opinion did not constitute a
recommendation as to the course of action that Activision Blizzard (or the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors or any committee thereof) should pursue in connection with the merger or otherwise address the
merits of the underlying decision by Activision Blizzard to engage in the merger, including in comparison to
other strategies or transactions that might be available to Activision Blizzard or which Activision Blizzard
might engage in or consider.
In connection with its opinion, Allen & Company performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses,
including those described below. The summary of the analyses below and certain factors considered is not a
comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by Allen & Company. The
preparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a complex process involving various determinations as to the
most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion and analyses are not readily susceptible to
summary description. Allen & Company arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken
and assessed as a whole, and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or
method of analysis. Accordingly, Allen & Company believes that the analyses and factors summarized below
must be considered as a whole and in context. Allen & Company further believes that selecting portions of
the analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the processes underlying Allen & Company’s analyses and opinion.
In performing its financial analyses, Allen & Company considered industry performance, general business
and economic, market and financial conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many
of which are beyond the control of Activision Blizzard. No company, business or transaction reviewed is
identical or directly comparable to Activision Blizzard, its businesses or the merger and an evaluation of
these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public
trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed. The assumptions
and estimates of the future performance of Activision Blizzard in or underlying Allen & Company’s analyses
and the implied reference ranges derived from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or
those suggested by such analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of Allen & Company’s
analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration and were provided to the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors in connection with the delivery of Allen &

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company
might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future.
Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the reference ranges resulting from, any particular
analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken as the
views of Allen & Company regarding the actual value of Activision Blizzard.
Allen & Company did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration in the merger. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined
through negotiations between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, rather than by any financial advisor, and
approved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was
solely that of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. Allen & Company’s opinion and analyses were only
one of many factors considered by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors in its evaluation of the merger
and the merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors or management with respect to the merger or the consideration payable in the
merger.
Financial Analyses
The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled “- Financial Analyses” is a summary
of the material financial analyses provided by Allen & Company in connection with its opinion, dated
January 17, 2022, to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. The summary set forth below is not a
comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by Allen & Company in connection with its opinion, nor does
the order of the analyses in the summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other
analysis. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses performed by Allen & Company, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Allen
& Company. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Allen & Company. Future results may differ from those
described and such differences may be material. For purposes of the financial analyses described below, (i) the
term “Activision Blizzard forecasts” refers in this section to the internal financial forecasts, estimates and
other financial and operating data relating to Activision Blizzard prepared by the management of Activision
Blizzard as reflected in the January 2022 forecasts, and (ii) the term “EBITDA” means earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and certain one-time non-
recurring items, as applicable (referenced in the January 2022 forecasts as “Adjusted EBITDA”).

companies with operations in the interactive entertainment industry that Allen & Company considered
generally relevant for purposes of analysis, collectively referred to as the “selected companies:”
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.
Electronic Arts Inc.

Allen & Company reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as implied equity values
based on closing stock prices on January 14, 2022, which is the last unaffected trading day prior to public
announcement of the merger (except in the case of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., which was based on
its unaffected closing stock price on January 7, 2022, prior to the announcement of its pending acquisition of
Zynga Inc.) plus total debt and non-controlling interests (as applicable) and less cash and cash equivalents
and unconsolidated assets, as applicable, as a multiple of calendar years 2022 and 2023 estimated EBITDA.
Financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts’
estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data of Activision Blizzard was
based on the Activision Blizzard forecasts and other information provided by the management of Activision
Blizzard.

selected ranges of calendar year 2022 and calendar year 2023 estimated EBITDA multiples derived from the
selected companies of 13.5x to 18.0x and 12.5x to 15.0x, respectively, to corresponding data of Activision
Blizzard based on the Activision Blizzard forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied

Allen & Company reviewed, among other information and to the extent publicly available, transaction values
of the selected transactions, calculated as the enterprise values implied for the target companies involved in
the selected transactions based on the consideration paid or payable in the selected transactions, as a
multiple of the latest 12 months EBITDA of the target company as of the applicable announcement date of

Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Activision Blizzard
common stock in the form of stock options and stock units (i.e., RSUs and PSUs). Our executive officers hold
options, RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock based on
service over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock ranging from 0 to 125% (and, in some cases, up to 250%) of the target

TABLE OF CONTENTS
number of shares based on both service over a time-based vesting schedule and achievement of specified
performance goals over a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold options and RSUs,
which represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, subject to vesting
requirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as a separation from
service. The merger agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity
awards:
Stock Options
Each outstanding option to purchase Activision Blizzard common stock granted pursuant to our
equity incentive plans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, or (ii) will become
vested by its terms at the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration for each share of Activision Blizzard common stock that would have been
issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the effective time, less the applicable
option exercise price for each such share of Activision Blizzard common stock underlying such option
and any applicable withholding taxes.
Each option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, and is not cancelled and
converted as described above, and has an exercise price per share of Activision Blizzard common
stock that is less than the merger consideration, will be, as of the effective time and as determined by
Microsoft, (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a nonqualified stock option or (y) converted
into a nonqualified stock option granted pursuant to Microsoft’s equity incentive plans, in either
case, in respect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
subject to such assumed option as of immediately prior to the effective time (determined based on
target performance levels, as applicable) multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the
merger consideration and (B) the denominator of which is Microsoft’s stock price (i.e., the volume
weighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above
rounded up) of common stock of Microsoft on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending
with the last trading day ending immediately prior to the closing date) (which we refer to as the
“exchange ratio”), at an exercise price per share of common stock of Microsoft equal to (i) the exercise
price of such option divided by (ii) the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. In each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this
paragraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting and exercisability will remain the same with
respect to Activision Blizzard options subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to Activision
Blizzard options subject to performance-based vesting will be converted into time-based vesting
options (determined based on target performance levels) that will vest at the conclusion of the
original performance period.
In the event that the exercise price per share under any option is equal to or greater than the merger
consideration, such option will be cancelled as of the effective time without payment therefor and will
have no further force or effect.
Stock Units
Each outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs granted pursuant to Activision Blizzard’s equity incentive
plans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) will become vested by its terms
at the effective time or (iii) is granted to a non-employee member of the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors, will, as of the effective time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to such award,
less any applicable withholding taxes.
Each outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time and is not cancelled and converted as described above, will, as of the effective time, be, as
determined by Microsoft (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a stock-based award or (y)
converted into a stock-based award pursuant to Microsoft’s equity incentive plans, in either case, in
respect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock

subject to such award as of immediately prior to the effective time (determined based on target
performance levels, as applicable) multiplied by the exchange ratio. In each case of clauses (x) and (y)
of this paragraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting will remain the same with respect to
equity awards subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to equity awards subject to
performance-based vesting will be converted into time-based vesting equity awards (determined
based on target performance levels) that will vest at the conclusion of the original performance
period.
Notwithstanding the treatment of outstanding unvested options, RSUs and PSUs described above, prior to
the closing date, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards that would otherwise be converted as
set forth herein as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and converting an award into the right to receive
the merger consideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to the
award (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of options), less any applicable withholding taxes;
provided that for options, such election may apply only to those options that are otherwise scheduled to
vest within 120 days following the closing date).
If the treatment described above of an award of stock units or options held by a non-U.S. employee would be
prohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the
applicable jurisdiction (in each case, as reasonably determined by Microsoft), Microsoft will provide
compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have been
provided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would not
result in the imposition of additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code. This compensation will be
provided in the form of a cash payment (less applicable taxes) or a new equity award, as reasonably
determined by Microsoft.
Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the Merger
When considering the recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that you vote to
approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our non-employee directors
and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your
interests as a stockholder. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware of and considered these
interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing
the negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and in
recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Activision Blizzard.
Accelerated Vesting of Equity Compensation Upon Certain Terminations
None of the Activision Blizzard outstanding equity awards provide for “single trigger” vesting immediately
at the effective time (i.e., as a result of the merger without a termination of employment). However, under the
terms of the merger agreement, outstanding RSUs held by non-employee directors at the time of the closing
of the merger will vest in full and the holder will receive the consideration described above under the section
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement  -  The Merger -  Treatment of Equity
Compensation” beginning on page 57.
Microsoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may approve, and the Compensation Committee of the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors (which we refer to as the “Compensation Committee”) has approved,
that options, RSUs and PSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger agreement and certain awards
granted after the date of the merger agreement that will be outstanding as of closing, as further detailed
below, that are converted at the effective time of the merger to Microsoft unvested options and unvested
RSUs pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement (such conversion is described above under “Treatment
of Equity Compensation”), will vest in full on a “double trigger” basis (i.e., upon a qualifying termination of
employment after a specified period following the effective time of the merger), as follows:
Any such award that was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement, including to our
executive officers, and certain awards granted after the date of the merger agreement that will be
outstanding as of closing, will vest in full if, during the 18-month period immediately following the
effective time, the employee’s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their
respective subsidiaries without “cause” or by the employee for “good reason”  (where “cause” is
defined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and “good reason” is defined
59 • 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
below) and provided that such acceleration will not modify any more favorable acceleration terms in
an arrangement already entered into with such employee.
Additionally, pursuant to the merger agreement (as modified by the confidential disclosure letter to
the merger agreement), Activision Blizzard and Microsoft agreed that certain of our employees,
including executive officers Grant Dixton, Brian Bulatao and Armin Zerza, will be entitled to terminate
their employment within 60 days following the six-month anniversary of the effective time, which will
be deemed a termination by the executive for “good reason,” entitling the executive officer to the
equity acceleration benefits described directly above and the severance benefits under their
individual arrangements or, if greater, the enhanced severance plan, each as described below.
Management RSUs
Microsoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may grant, and the Compensation Committee has approved the
grant of up to $50 million in the aggregate of, RSUs to certain members of senior management, including our
executive officers (but excluding the Chief Executive Officer), which we refer to as “management RSUs.” No
management RSUs have yet been granted as of the date of this proxy statement. To the extent granted,
management RSUs would vest in full if, during the 18-month period immediately following the effective time,
the employee’s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries
without “cause” or by the employee for “good reason”  (where “cause” is defined in the confidential
disclosure letter to the merger agreement and “good reason” is defined below) and provided that such
acceleration would not modify any more favorable acceleration terms in an arrangement already entered into
with such employee.
Retention RSUs
Microsoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may grant RSUs up to a certain aggregate grant date value, and
the Compensation Committee has approved that grants of RSUs may be made, to certain employees (but
excluding any individual who receives a grant of management RSUs) for retention purposes and to
incentivize employees to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which we
refer to as “retention RSUs”). No retention RSUs have yet been granted as of the date of this proxy
statement. To the extent granted, retention RSUs would vest in full if, during the 18-month period
immediately following the effective time, the employee’s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision
Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries without “cause” or by the employee for “good reason”  (where
“cause” is defined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and “good reason” is defined
below) and provided that such acceleration would not modify any more favorable acceleration terms in an
arrangement already entered into with such employee.
Employee RSUs
Prior to the effective time, Activision Blizzard may grant RSUs, up to a certain aggregate grant date value, to
employees other than the Chief Executive Officer in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice of the applicable business unit or functional business unit (which we refer to as “employee RSUs”).
No employee RSUs have yet been granted as of the date of this proxy statement. To the extent employee
RSUs are granted, certain of the employee RSUs that are granted to certain new employees hired before
September 1, 2022, would vest in full if, during the 18-month period immediately following the effective time,
the employee’s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries
without “cause” or by the employee for “good reason”  (where “cause” is defined in the confidential
disclosure letter to the merger agreement and “good reason” is defined below) and provided that such
acceleration would not modify any more favorable acceleration terms in an arrangement already entered into
with such employee.
“Good Reason” means, subject to certain notice and cure periods, in each case without the prior written
consent of the holder: (A) solely for those holders who are eligible for the enhanced severance plan, a
material diminution in authorities, duties and responsibilities, as measured in the aggregate, as compared to
those prior to the effective time (provided, that the following will not constitute “good reason”: (1) the
holder’s continued employment with substantially the same responsibility with respect to Activision
Blizzard’s business and operations (e.g., the holder’s title is revised to reflect the holder’s placement within
60

the overall corporate hierarchy or the holder provides services to a subsidiary, business unit or otherwise) or
(2) changes resulting solely from Activision Blizzard ceasing to be a stand-alone public corporation); (B) a
material diminution in base salary as in effect immediately prior to the effective time; or (C) a relocation of
primary office location by more than 50 miles (provided, that requiring the holder to return to work in the
holder’s primary office location after working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic or continuing to work
remotely rather than a primary office location shall not constitute a relocation).
Arrangements with Mr. Kotick
Activision Blizzard previously announced on October 28, 2021 Mr. Kotick’s intent that his base salary would
be reduced to California’s minimum annual salary (which is approximately $62,500 for 2022) and that he not
be awarded any bonuses or equity grants until the Workplace Responsibility Committee of the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors has determined that Activision Blizzard has made appropriate progress toward
achievement of the transformational gender-related goals and other commitments described in such
announcement.
In connection with the merger, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft agreed that if the Workplace
Responsibility Committee of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors concludes and reports
publicly that Activision Blizzard has made appropriate progress toward the achievement of the
transformational gender-related goals and other commitments described in Activision Blizzard’s press
release on October 28, 2021 (e.g., launching new zero-tolerance harassment policy, increasing the
percentage of women and non-binary people in Activision Blizzard’s workforce by 50%, investing
$250,000,000 to accelerate opportunities for diverse talent, waiving arbitration of individual sexual
harassment claims and increasing visibility on pay equity), then the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors may, no earlier than six months after the date of the merger agreement, in its discretion:
grant an annual equity award to Mr. Kotick as set forth in his employment agreement (as may be
extended); provided, that any such award may be granted solely in the form of time-based
restricted stock units and will have a grant value on the date of grant equal to no greater than
the lesser of (x) the 50th percentile of Activision Blizzard’s then applicable group of peer
companies’ chief executive officer long-term incentive grants and (y) $22,000,000; and/or
provide cash compensation to Mr. Kotick under the existing terms of his employment agreement
(as may be extended) and without regard to any waiver of compensation by Mr. Kotick;
provided, that (x) his annualized base salary will not exceed $875,000 and (y) his target annual
cash bonus would not exceed 200% of his base salary (pro-rated). Any salary increase would be
prospective following the Workplace Responsibility Committee’s conclusion and will not be
retroactively applied and any bonus in respect of the calendar year in which the compensation is
reinstated will be based on 200% of such increased base salary and prorated in respect of the
period following the Workplace Responsibility Committee’s conclusion.
Value of Shares and Equity Awards Held by Directors and Executive Officers
The estimated aggregate amount of the merger consideration payable with respect to shares of Activision
Blizzard common stock, including vested stock options, held by our non-employee directors and executive
officers, as a group (inclusive of such persons who have served at any time since the beginning of 2021),
assuming the merger closed on March 8, 2022, is approximately $707 million.
The estimated aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by our non-employee directors and executive
officers, including our named executive officers and including such persons who have served at any time
since the beginning of 2021, that would accelerate in connection with the merger, assuming the merger closed
on March 8, 2022, and, immediately thereafter, the executive officer’s employment was terminated by
Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries without “cause” or by the executive officer for
“good reason”  (where “cause” is defined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and
“good reason” is defined above) is approximately $1 million for our non-employee directors, and
approximately $56 million for our executive officers. These values do not include any new Activision Blizzard
equity awards that may be granted after the date of this proxy statement. These values are calculated by
multiplying the number of shares underlying awards by the per share merger consideration (assuming

target performance for PSUs and performance options), less the exercise price for options. For estimates of
the value of such unvested equity awards for each of our named executive officers individually, see the
section below entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement  -  The Merger - Interests of the Non-
Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the Merger - “Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 65. Certain individuals who were executive officers at any time since the
beginning of 2021 - Chris Walther, Dennis Durkin and Claudine Naughton - are no longer employed by
Activision Blizzard and these executive officers no longer hold any Activision Blizzard equity awards,
whether options, RSUs or PSUs.
Potential Contractual Payments to Executive Officers upon Termination of Employment, Including in Connection
with the Merger
We have entered into agreements with our executive officers, including our named executive officers, which
would entitle the executives to severance payments and benefits in the event of certain qualifying
terminations of employment. In the case of each of our executive officers other than Mr. Kotick, the
severance benefits under the enhanced severance plan described below will be greater than the benefits that
they would receive under their respective employment agreements.
Mr. Kotick’s executive employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by
Activision Blizzard without “cause” or if he resigns for “good reason”  (as each such terms are
defined in his agreement), in either case within 12 months after a change of control (which will occur
at the effective time), he will be entitled to receive:
an amount equal to three times the sum of his annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to
the date of the termination of his employment and the target value of his 2016 annual bonus,
payable in equal installments over 12 months following the date of the termination of his
employment;
any earned but unpaid bonuses for prior years;
a pro-rated payment of his annual bonus for the year of termination based on the percentage of
the fiscal year completed as of the date of the termination of his employment and the attainment
of the applicable performance metrics at the end of the performance period;
full vesting of his stock options and continued vesting of any unvested stock units based on
the actual attainment of underlying performance goals, as if his employment had not been
terminated, as applicable (noting that Mr. Kotick does not now hold, and will not be granted prior
to the closing of the merger, any performance-based awards); and
continued Activision Blizzard-paid health insurance coverage for two years for him and his
eligible dependents and reimbursement by Activision Blizzard of the annual premiums for
supplemental life insurance benefits, with an annual cap of $80,000 through October 2026.
In connection with the merger agreement, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft agreed that, on or after July 18,
2022 (the date six months following the execution of the merger agreement), the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors may extend Mr. Kotick’s employment agreement by 12 months.
Mr. Zerza’s executive employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by
Activision Blizzard without “cause”  (as defined in his agreement) or if he resigns following the
relocation of his principal place of business by more than 50 miles in a manner that materially and
adversely affects his commute, he will be entitled to receive:
continued payment of base salary through the end of the term of his agreement;
any earned but unpaid bonuses for prior years;
a pro-rated payment of his annual bonus for the year of termination based on the percentage of
the year completed as of the date of the termination of his employment and the attainment of the
applicable performance metrics at the end of the performance period;
if such termination occurs (i) after December 31, 2021 but before March 31, 2022, (ii) after
December 31, 2022 but before March 31, 2023 or (iii) after December 31, 2023 but before

prior to such termination (i.e., 2021, 2022, or 2023) is 90% or more of the applicable operating
income objective for such year, as determined by the Compensation Committee, Mr. Zerza would
receive a lump sum payment of $950,000; and
to the extent termination occurs following the completion of an applicable performance period of
the PSU award granted to him on May 6, 2021 that relates to operating income performance, but
before the end of the time-vesting period of such PSU award, and provided that the performance
objective(s) relating to such PSU award were met, a lump sum cash amount equal to the product

Mr. Alegre’s executive employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by
Activision Blizzard without “cause”  (as defined in his agreement) or if he resigns following the
relocation of his principal place of business by more than 50 miles in a manner that materially and
adversely affects his commute, he will be entitled to receive:
continued payment of base salary through the end of the term of his agreement;
any earned but unpaid bonuses for prior years;
a pro-rated payment of his annual bonus for the year of termination based on the percentage of
the year completed as of the date of the termination of his employment and the attainment of the
applicable performance metrics at the end of the performance period;

2020, 2021 or 2022) is 90% or more of the operating income objective for such year, as determined
by the Compensation Committee, in each case, a lump sums payment of $1,666,667 (which
amounts are cumulative to the extent underlying conditions are met); and
to the extent termination occurs following the completion of an applicable performance period of
the PSU award granted to him on May 7, 2020, that relates to operating income performance, but
before the end of the time-vesting period, and provided that the performance objective(s)
relating to such PSU award were met, a lump sum cash amount, equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares he would have received upon vesting of that tranche of the PSU award had it
not been canceled upon his termination and (y) the closing price per share of Activision Blizzard
common stock on May 7, 2020 (i.e., $73.10), in consideration of the termination of the PSU award
prior to its vesting.
Mr. Dixton’s employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by Activision
Blizzard without “cause”  (as defined in his agreement) or if he resigns following the relocation of his
principal place of business by more than 50 miles in a manner that materially and adversely affects his
commute, he will be entitled to receive:
continued payment of base salary through the end of the term of his agreement;

Mr. Bulatao’s employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by Activision
Blizzard without “cause”  (as defined in his agreement) or if he resigns following the relocation of his
principal place of business by more than 50 miles in a manner that materially and adversely affects his
commute, he will be entitled to receive:
continued payment of base salary through the end of the term of his agreement;

Activision Blizzard’s operating income for the year that ended immediately prior to such
termination (i.e., 2021, 2022 or 2023) is 90% or more of the operating income objective for such
year, as determined by the Compensation Committee, a lump sum payment equal to $950,000; and
to the extent termination occurs following the completion of an applicable performance period of
the PSU award granted to him on March 9, 2021 that relates to operating income performance, but

been canceled upon his termination and (y) the closing price per share of Activision Blizzard
common stock on March 9, 2021 (i.e., $92.50), in consideration of the termination of the PSU
award prior to its vesting.
As a condition to receipt of the severance payments and benefits described above, each executive officer is
required to execute a separation and release of claims agreement in favor of Activision Blizzard and its
affiliates and to continue to comply with certain post-termination covenants in favor of Activision Blizzard
and its affiliates.
280G Mitigation Actions
The employment agreements of Messrs. Kotick, Zerza, Alegre, Dixton and Bulatao provide for a “best net”
approach such that if the payment of any amounts to the executive would subject the executive to the excise
tax provisions of Section 280G of the Code, the payments would be reduced to an amount below the
threshold at which such penalty tax provisions apply if such a reduction (and the avoidance of such penalty
taxes) would be more favorable to the executive on an after-tax basis. While Activision Blizzard may be
permitted to take certain actions to reduce the amount of any potential “excess parachute payments” for
“disqualified individuals”  (each as defined in Section 280G of the Code), the Compensation Committee has
not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate the anticipated impact of Section 280G of the Code on
Activision Blizzard and any disqualified individuals. Executives are not entitled to receive gross-ups or tax
reimbursements from Activision Blizzard with respect to any potential excise taxes.
Enhanced Severance Plan
Microsoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may approve, and the Compensation Committee has approved
the key terms of, an enhanced severance plan, which provides that a limited number of covered
64 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
employees, including our executive officers, would be entitled to the following benefits in the event their
employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates
without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason”  (where “cause” is defined in the confidential
disclosure letter to the merger agreement and “good reason” is defined above), in either case, within 18
months following the effective time (subject to the executive’s execution of Activision Blizzard’s customary
release of claims): (i) the greater of (A) either one or two times (depending on level) the sum of the
executive’s base salary and target annual cash incentive bonus (excluding any milestone or special bonus
payments) and (B) the severance payable under the executive’s employment agreement; (ii) a pro-rated target
annual cash incentive bonus payment based on the percentage of the year completed as of the termination
date; and (iii) reimbursement of COBRA premiums for a certain period. In the case of each of our executive
officers (other than Mr. Kotick), the severance benefits under the enhanced severance plan will be greater
than the benefits that they would receive under their respective employment agreements.
The estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance benefits our executive officers, including our named
executive officers, would have received upon a qualifying termination of employment under the enhanced
severance plan, assuming the merger closed on March 8, 2022, and a qualifying termination of employment
occurred immediately thereafter, is approximately $31 million. For estimates of the amounts of such cash
severance that each of our named executive officers would have received under the enhanced severance plan
individually, see the section below entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement  -  The Merger - 
Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the
Merger - “Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 65.
Omnibus Severance Plan
Microsoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may approve, and the Compensation Committee has approved
the key terms of, an omnibus severance plan, which include that employees of Activision Blizzard as of the
effective time (other than those covered under the enhanced severance plan) would be entitled to the
following benefits in the event their employment is terminated by Activision Blizzard or its affiliates
(including Microsoft) other than for cause within 12 months following the effective time (subject to the
applicable employee’s execution of Activision Blizzard’s customary release of claims): (i) the greater of (A)
up to 52 weeks’ salary, plus 60 days’ pay, for covered individuals in positions of vice president and above
(or, for individuals in positions of senior director and below up to 26 weeks’ salary, plus 60 days’ pay), and
(B) the severance payable under any other agreement with the employee, if any; (ii) a pro-rated target annual
cash incentive bonus based on the percentage of the year completed as of the termination date; and (iii)
reimbursement of one year of COBRA premiums.
Other Arrangements with Microsoft
Except as otherwise set forth herein, as of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has
entered into any agreement with Microsoft regarding employment with, or compensation to be received from,
the surviving corporation or Microsoft on a going-forward basis following the closing of the merger and
there have been no discussions of any such arrangements between Microsoft and any of our executive
officers.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the estimated amounts of the
payments and benefits that each named executive officer of Activision Blizzard would have received in
connection with the merger, assuming the merger closed on March 8, 2022 and, immediately thereafter, the
employment of the named executive officer was terminated by Activision Blizzard or its affiliates (including
Microsoft) without “cause” or the named executive officer resigned for “good reason”  (where, for Mr.
Kotick, each such term has the meaning set forth in his employment agreement with Activision Blizzard and,
for the other executives, “cause” is defined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and
“good reason” is defined above). This compensation is subject to an advisory vote of Activision Blizzard’s
stockholders, as described below under the section entitled “Proposal 2: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related
Executive Compensation Arrangements” beginning on page 95.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The calculations in the tables below do not include any new Activision Blizzard equity awards or other
compensation increases that may be granted to the named executive officers before the effective time,
including management RSUs. In addition to the assumptions regarding the closing date of the merger and
termination of the employment of the named executive officers, these estimates are based on certain other
assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the tables below. In addition to the named
executive officers set forth in the table below, Chris Walther, Dennis Durkin and Claudine Naughton also
each served as a named executive officer during fiscal year 2021; however, these individuals would not
become entitled to any accelerated payment, vesting or benefits or other compensation as a result of the
closing of the merger. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in
connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.

Messrs. Walther and Durkin and Ms. Naughton also each served as named executive officers during
Activision Blizzard’s last fiscal year and these former executive officers are not entitled to any amounts
in connection with any compensation arrangement as a result of or in connection with the merger.
Cash. The amounts in this column reflect the value of the cash severance payments payable to each
named executive officer, including a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination. For Mr. Kotick,
the amount in this column represents severance and, pursuant to his employment agreement with
Activision Blizzard, is equal to three times the sum of his current annual base salary and his 2016 target
bonus. For Messrs. Zerza, Alegre, Bulatao and Dixton, the amounts in this column represent severance
and a prorated annual bonus payable under the enhanced severance plan. The breakdown of the
amounts in this column for Mr. Alegre are $5,400,000 for severance and $247,808 for prorated annual
bonus. The breakdown of the amounts in this column for Mr. Zerza are $4,000,000 for severance and
$220,274 for prorated annual bonus. The breakdown of the amounts in this column for Mr. Bulatao are
$4,000,000 for severance and $183,562 for prorated annual bonus. The breakdown of the amounts in this
column for Mr. Dixton are $2,625,000 for severance and $103,253 for prorated annual bonus. The
severance and prorated bonus payments are all “double trigger” in nature, which means that payment of
these amounts is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or following the closing
of the merger. Messrs. Zerza, Bulatao and Dixton are each entitled to terminate their employment within
60 days following the six-month anniversary of the effective time, which will be deemed a qualifying
termination. Under their employment agreements, each of Messrs. Kotick, Zerza, Alegre, Bulatao and
Dixton are subject to post-termination covenants, including non-solicitation covenants, in favor of
Activision Blizzard and its affiliates.
Equity. The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate values of the accelerated vesting of the RSUs
which would be assumed by Microsoft for Messrs. Zerza, Alegre, Bulatao and Dixton (and for PSUs,
assumes target performance). These amounts are “double trigger” in nature, which means that the
accelerated vesting is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or after the closing
of the merger. Messrs. Zerza, Bulatao and Dixton are each entitled to terminate their employment within
60 days following the six-month anniversary of the effective time, which will be deemed a qualifying
termination. Mr. Kotick does not currently hold any equity awards for which vesting would accelerate
upon the closing of the merger or upon a termination of employment following the closing of the merger.
Perquisites/Benefits. The amounts in this column reflect the value of continued Activision Blizzard-paid
health insurance coverage for Mr. Kotick for two years and supplemental life insurance benefits through
October 2026 pursuant to his employment agreement with Activision Blizzard, and for Messrs. Zerza,
Alegre, Bulatao and Dixton reimbursement of COBRA premiums for two years under

The following is a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders (as
defined below) that exchange their shares of Activision Blizzard common stock for the merger consideration.
This discussion is limited to U.S. Holders and does not address any tax consequences arising under the
Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax, U.S. federal non-income
tax laws or the laws of any state or local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. This discussion is based upon the Code,
the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department and judicial authorities and published positions of the
Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the “IRS,” all as currently in effect on the date of this proxy
statement. These laws may change or be subject to differing interpretations, possibly retroactively, and any
change or differing interpretation could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought
and do not intend to seek a ruling from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. This discussion
assumes that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the merger agreement and as described in
this proxy statement.
If a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
holds shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, the tax treatment of a person treated as a partner in such
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Such partnerships and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax
advisors about the tax consequences of the merger to them.
Holders are urged to consult with their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences of the merger to them in light
of their particular situations, including the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Activision Blizzard common stock
that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more United States
persons (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be
treated as a United States person; or
an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.
This discussion assumes that U.S. Holders of Activision Blizzard common stock hold their shares as a capital
asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this
discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to U.S. Holders
in light of their particular circumstances or that may be applicable to U.S. Holders if such holders are subject
to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including any holder that is:

Activision Blizzard stockholders that are not U.S. Holders may have different U.S. federal income tax
consequences than those described below and are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the
tax treatment of the merger to them under U.S. and non-U.S. laws.
The following discussion does not address the tax consequences of any transactions effectuated before,
after or at the same time as the merger, whether or not in connection with the merger, including, without
limitation, the tax consequences to holders of options, warrants or similar rights to purchase shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock.
Tax Consequences of the Merger
The receipt of the merger consideration by U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of Activision Blizzard
common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Therefore, a U.S. Holder who receives the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Activision Blizzard
common stock pursuant to the merger generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if
any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the merger and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its
Activision Blizzard common stock exchanged therefor.
A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will generally equal the
price the U.S. Holder paid for such shares. Capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be
eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates that are applicable to long-term capital gains if the U.S.
Holder has held its Activision Blizzard common stock for more than one year as of the effective date of the
merger. Capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to short-term capital gains (and
taxed at ordinary income tax rates) if the U.S. Holder has held its Activision Blizzard common stock for one
year or less as of the date of the merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S.
Holder acquired different blocks of Activision Blizzard common stock at different times or different prices,
the U.S. Holder must determine its tax basis and holding period separately for each block of Activision
Blizzard common stock.

General
Activision Blizzard and Microsoft have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all
regulatory filing and notification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required or recommended
to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These
approvals include approval under, or notifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and the competition laws of the
European Union, the United Kingdom, China and certain other jurisdictions.
In addition, each of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft have agreed to (1) cooperate and coordinate with each
other to make such filings; (2) use its reasonable best efforts to supply the other with any information that
may be required in order to make such filings; (3) use its reasonable best efforts to supply any additional
information that reasonably may be requested to obtain regulatory approvals; (4) use its reasonable best
efforts to take all action necessary to obtain regulatory approvals as soon as practicable; and (5) provide
notice to the other party if it plans to participate in any meeting or substantive conversation with any
governmental authority with respect to the merger. Microsoft will, after good faith consultation with
Activision Blizzard and after considering, in good faith, Activision Blizzard’s views and comments, control
and lead all communications, negotiations, timing decisions and strategy on behalf of the parties relating to
regulatory approvals.
If and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Microsoft, Sub and, solely to the
extent requested by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard will (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Activision Blizzard; and (B) any other
restrictions on the activities of Activision Blizzard; and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of
the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft is not required to offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or
otherwise take any action that would reasonably be expected to (x) have a material adverse impact on
Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) have a material impact on the benefits expected
to be derived from the merger by Microsoft or (z) have a more than immaterial impact on any business or
product line of Microsoft.
HSR Act and Other Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the merger cannot be completed until Activision
Blizzard and Microsoft file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission,
69 TABLE OF CONTENTS
which we refer to as the “FTC,” and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as
the “DOJ,” under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A
transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day
waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early
termination of that waiting period. On March 3, 2022, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft each received a
request for additional information and documentary material (which we refer to as a “Second Request”) from
the FTC in connection with the FTC’s review of the transaction. The effect of the Second Request is to
extend the waiting period imposed under the HSR Act until the 30th day after substantial compliance by
Activision Blizzard and Microsoft with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by
the FTC or as otherwise agreed between the parties and the FTC. Completion of the transaction remains
subject to the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the satisfaction or
waiver of the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement. The parties expect to complete the
transaction in Microsoft’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to
license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before
or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the
antitrust laws under certain circumstances.
Foreign Competition Laws
European Union. Both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard conduct business across the European Union in
multiple Member States. Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which we refer to as the “EU Merger Regulation,” mergers and
acquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and individual European Union sales exceeding specified
thresholds must be notified to, and approved by, the European Commission before they are implemented.
Microsoft and Activision Blizzard meet the thresholds set out in the EU Merger Regulation and are therefore
obligated to (i) notify the European Commission of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and (ii) wait
to implement the merger until after the European Commission has issued a decision declaring the merger
compatible with the common market (and/or if the European Commission has referred any aspect of the
merger to one or more competent authorities of a European Union member state under Article 9 of the EU
Merger Regulation or an EFTA state under Article 6 of Protocol 24 to the EEA Agreement, until each
competent authority has issued a clearance or a confirmation that the merger may proceed). As is customary,
Microsoft and Activision Blizzard intend to file a formal notification as soon as is reasonably practicable.
United Kingdom. With respect to the United Kingdom, the parties intend to notify the merger to the
Competition and Markets Authority, which we refer to as the “CMA,” under the Enterprise Act 2002. The
CMA may issue an order that, among other things, prevents the completion of the merger or prevents the
integration of the parties’ businesses. The practical effect of this is typically that the merger may not be
completed until the merger has been notified to the CMA and the merging parties have obtained clearance.
Microsoft and Activision Blizzard intend to file a formal notification as soon as is reasonably practicable.
China. In addition, under the Antimonopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, transactions involving
parties with sales above certain revenue levels cannot be completed until they are reviewed and approved by
the State Administration for Market Regulation, which we refer to as “SAMR.” Microsoft and Activision
Blizzard have sufficient revenues to exceed SAMR’s statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the
merger is therefore conditioned upon SAMR approval. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard intend to submit a
draft notification to SAMR as soon as is reasonably practicable.
The merger is also subject to clearance or approval by competition authorities in certain other jurisdictions.
The merger cannot be completed until Microsoft and Activision Blizzard obtain clearance to

Following the announcement of the transaction, complaints were filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the
United States District Court for the Central District of California, the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against

14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed in
connection with the proposed transaction between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft omitted certain
purportedly material information which rendered the preliminary proxy statement incomplete and misleading.
Specifically, the complaints allege that the preliminary proxy statement failed to disclose material information
regarding the sales process, Activision Blizzard’s projections and the financial analyses of Activision
Blizzard’s financial advisor. The complaints seek, among other things, an order to enjoin the transaction
unless and until additional disclosures are issued; and, if the transaction closes, damages. The Watson
complaint also alleges that Activision Blizzard’s directors entered into the transaction for self-interested
reasons, including receipt of personal benefits in the transaction. It is possible additional

In September 2021, we entered into a proposed consent decree with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (which we refer to as the “EEOC”) to settle claims regarding certain employment practices. The
consent decree is subject to approval by the United States District Court, Central District of California, and,
among other things, provides for the creation of an $18 million settlement fund for eligible claimants;
upgrading Activision Blizzard policies, practices, and training to further prevent and eliminate harassment
and discrimination in its workplaces, including implementing an expanded performance review system with a
new equal opportunity focus; and providing ongoing oversight and review of Activision Blizzard’s training
programs, investigation policies, disciplinary framework and compliance by appointing a third-party equal
opportunity consultant whose findings will be regularly reported to the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors as well as the EEOC. There can be no assurance that the consent decree will be approved by the
court. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (which we refer to as the “DFEH”) filed a
motion to intervene in the matter, seeking to object to the consent decree, including the amount of the
settlement fund; and has appealed denial of that motion.
Further information about these matters can be found in Activision Blizzard’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022 (which we refer to as the

addition, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors recently received notice of an investigation by the DFEH
and investigatory subpoenas.

The following summary describes certain material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of
the merger agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read
the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the
information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are
governed by the express terms of the merger agreement (as qualified by the confidential disclosure letter to the
merger agreement) and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger
agreement (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made
solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) are subject to important qualifications,
limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and Sub in
connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement (including disclosures of both publicly
available information and confidential information regarding Activision Blizzard included in the
confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement); and (4) may also be subject to a contractual
standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the
SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Microsoft and Sub by Activision
Blizzard in connection with the merger agreement (including in the confidential disclosure letter to the
merger agreement). In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger
agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and Sub
rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such
parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the representations and warranties were
negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger
agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the
other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise. Activision Blizzard
stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of
the actual state of facts or condition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft or Sub or any of their respective
affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and
warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new
information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy statement. In
addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the
respective businesses of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and Sub, because the parties may take certain
actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or
as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to
the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with
information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information
regarding Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read
alone and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the
SEC regarding Activision Blizzard and our business.",85,85

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Activision Blizzard common stock (other than
shares held by (1) Activision Blizzard as treasury stock (excluding certain shares held by a wholly owned
subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, which shares will remain outstanding and unaffected by the merger); (2)
Microsoft, Sub or their respective subsidiaries (other than a certain wholly owned subsidiary of Activision
Blizzard); and (3) Activision Blizzard stockholders who have properly and validly exercised and perfected
their appraisal rights under Delaware law with respect to such shares) will be cancelled and automatically
converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration (which is $95.00 per share, without
interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding taxes).
Treatment of Equity Compensation
Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Activision Blizzard
common stock in the form of stock options and stock units (i.e., RSUs and PSUs). Our executive officers hold
options, RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock based on
service over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock ranging from 0 to 125% (and, in some cases, up to 250%) of the target
number of shares based on both service over a time-based vesting schedule and achievement of specified
performance goals over a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold options and RSUs,
which represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, subject to vesting
requirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as a separation from
service. The merger agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity
awards:
Stock Options
Each outstanding option to purchase Activision Blizzard common stock granted pursuant to our
equity incentive plans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, or (ii) will become
vested by its terms at the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration for each share of Activision Blizzard common stock that would have been
issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the effective time, less the applicable
option exercise price for each such share of Activision Blizzard common stock underlying such option
and any applicable withholding taxes.

converted as described above, and has an exercise price per share of Activision Blizzard common

Microsoft, (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a nonqualified stock option or (y) converted
into a nonqualified stock option granted pursuant to Microsoft’s equity incentive plans, in either
case, in respect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock
subject to such assumed option as of immediately prior to the effective time (determined based on
target performance levels, as applicable) multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the
merger consideration and (B) the denominator of which is Microsoft’s stock price (i.e., the volume
weighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above
rounded up) of common stock of Microsoft on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending
with the last trading day ending immediately prior to the closing date) (which we refer to as the
“exchange ratio”), at an exercise price per share of common stock of Microsoft equal to (i) the exercise
price of such option divided by (ii) the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. In each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this
paragraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting and exercisability will remain the same with
respect to Activision Blizzard options subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to Activision
Blizzard options subject to performance-based vesting will be converted into time-based vesting
options (determined based on target performance levels) that shall vest at the conclusion of the
original performance period.
In the event that the exercise price per share under any option is equal to or greater than the merger
consideration, such option will be cancelled as of the effective time without payment therefor and will
have no further force or effect.

Each outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs granted pursuant to Activision Blizzard’s equity incentive
plans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) will become vested by its terms
at the effective time or (iii) is granted to a non-employee member of the Activision Blizzard Board of
Directors, will, as of the effective time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to such award,
less any applicable withholding taxes.
Each outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time and is not cancelled and converted as described above, will, as of the effective time, be, as
determined by Microsoft (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a stock-based award or (y)
converted into a stock-based award pursuant to Microsoft’s equity incentive plans, in either case, in
respect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to
such award as of immediately prior to the effective time (determined based on target performance
levels, as applicable) multiplied by the exchange ratio. In each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this
paragraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting will remain the same with respect to equity
awards subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to equity awards subject to performance-
based vesting will be converted into time-based vesting equity awards (determined based on target
performance levels) that will vest at the conclusion of the original performance period.
Notwithstanding the treatment of outstanding unvested options, RSUs and PSUs described above, prior to
the closing date, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards that would otherwise be converted as
set forth herein as if they were vested, (i.e., by cancelling and converting an award into the right to receive
the merger consideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to the
award (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of options), less any applicable withholding taxes;
provided that for options, such election may apply only to those options that are otherwise scheduled to
vest within 120 days following the closing date).
If the treatment described above of an award of stock units or options held by a non-U.S. employee would be
prohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the
applicable jurisdiction (in each case, as reasonably determined by Microsoft), Microsoft will provide
compensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have been

Prior to the closing of the merger, Microsoft will designate a bank or trust company, which we refer to as the
“paying agent,” to make payments of the merger consideration to Activision Blizzard stockholders. At or
promptly following the effective time of the merger, Microsoft will deposit or cause to be deposited with the
paying agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate per share merger consideration to Activision Blizzard
stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement.
As soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will send to
each holder of record of shares of common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions advising
stockholders how to surrender stock certificates and book-entry shares in exchange for the per share merger
consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates, together with any required bond) with respect to shares of common stock represented
by stock certificates or a customary “agent’s message” with respect to book-entry shares representing the
shares of common stock and (2) a signed letter of transmittal (in the case of common stock represented by
stock certificates) and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such shares will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration in exchange therefor, without
interest. The amount of any per share merger consideration paid to Activision Blizzard stockholders may be
reduced by any applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld.
If any cash deposited with the paying agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the
merger, such cash will be returned to Microsoft, upon demand, and any stockholders who have not complied
with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to Microsoft for satisfaction
of their claims for payment. None of Microsoft, Sub, Activision Blizzard, the surviving corporation or the
paying agent will be liable to any Activision Blizzard stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
law.
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such
certificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then before such stockholder will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration,
Microsoft or the paying agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the
merger consideration, require such stockholder to make an affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction and to
deliver a bond in such amount as Microsoft or the paying agent may direct as indemnity against any claim

including the identity of the person making the proposal, the conditionality of such proposal, the

communication) (it being understood that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors (or a committee
thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an acquisition proposal until the close of
business on the 10th business day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in
connection with such acquisition proposal without such action being considered a violation of the
merger agreement); or
fail to include the recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors in this proxy
statement.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by

described below, effect a company board recommendation change if (1) other than in connection with a bona
fide acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior proposal, there has been an intervening event (as
defined below); or (2) Activision Blizzard has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal that the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with Activision
Blizzard’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, in each case, if the Activision
Blizzard Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with Activision Blizzard’s financial

described above; and (2) resolved to effect a company board recommendation change pursuant to the
merger agreement, which notice must describe the applicable intervening event in reasonable detail;
and
prior to effecting such company board recommendation change, Activision Blizzard and its
representatives, during such three-business day period, must have (1) negotiated with Microsoft and
its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Microsoft requests in writing to so negotiate) to

Blizzard Board of Directors no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a company
board recommendation change in response to such intervening event would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and (2) provided Microsoft and its representatives with an
opportunity to make a presentation to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors regarding the merger
agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Microsoft requests to make
such a presentation).
In addition, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors may effect a company board recommendation change

obligations under the merger agreement;

advance to the effect that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors has (1) received a bona fide
written acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2) concluded in good faith that such

recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement, which notice will describe the basis for
such company board recommendation change or termination, including the identity of the person or
“group” of persons making such acquisition proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
acquisition proposal and copies of all relevant documents relating to such acquisition proposal; and
prior to effecting such company board recommendation change or termination, Activision Blizzard
and its representatives, during the three business day notice period described above, have (1)
negotiated with Microsoft and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Microsoft requests
in writing to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger

provided Microsoft and its representatives with an opportunity to make a presentation to the
Activision Blizzard Board of Directors regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with
respect thereto (to the extent that Microsoft requests to make such a presentation).
In the event of any material revision to any such bona fide written acquisition proposal described above,
Activision Blizzard has also agreed to deliver a new notice to Microsoft and comply with the above
procedures with respect to such new written notice (with the notice period being two business days, except
that such notice period will not shorten the aforementioned original three-day notice period) and prior to
effecting a company board recommendation change or terminating the merger agreement, at the end of the
relevant notice period, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors must have in good faith (after consultation
with Activision Blizzard’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such

Following the merger, the surviving corporation will honor all employee plans and compensation and
severance arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, which we refer to as the
“Activision Blizzard Plans.” However, the surviving corporation may amend or terminate any such
arrangements in accordance with their terms or if required by law, and neither Microsoft nor the surviving
corporation will be obligated to continue any such employee plans.
Subject to any collective bargaining agreement, during the twelve-month period following the merger, the
surviving corporation will (and Microsoft will cause the surviving corporation to) either:
maintain for the benefit of each employee of Activision Blizzard who remains employed after the
closing, whom we refer to as “continuing employees,” the Activision Blizzard Plans (other than those
providing for equity awards) at benefit levels that are, in the aggregate, no less than those in effect at
Activision Blizzard on the date of the merger agreement, and provide target cash compensation and
benefits (other than any equity-based compensation, retention, transaction, milestone or other one-
time bonus or payment) to each continuing employee pursuant to the Activision Blizzard Plans;
provide target cash compensation (other than any equity-based compensation, retention, transaction,
milestone or other one-time bonus or payment), benefits and severance payments to each continuing
employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the target cash
compensation (other than any equity-based compensation, retention, transaction, milestone or other
one-time bonus or payment), benefits and severance payments provided to such continuing
employee immediately prior to the effective time; or
provide some combination of the two options described above such that each continuing employee
receives target cash compensation, benefits and severance payments that, taken as a whole, are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the target cash compensation (other than any equity-based
compensation, retention, transaction, milestone or other one-time bonus or payment), benefits and
severance payments and benefits provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the
effective time.
Notwithstanding the obligations provided for above, Microsoft’s standard compensation, benefits and/or
severance that are provided to any continuing employee and that would be provided to a similarly situated
Microsoft employee will satisfy Microsoft’s and the surviving corporation’s obligations to any continuing
employees.

Microsoft has agreed to give credit to continuing employees who, after the merger, participate in employee
benefit plans maintained by Microsoft for all service with Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries before the
merger for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits (other than for purposes
of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or post-employment welfare plan, except that
such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of benefits). Microsoft will
credit each continuing employee with accrued but unused vacation or paid time off in accordance with
Activision Blizzard’s vacation or paid time off policies in effect immediately prior to the merger.
With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Microsoft in which continuing employees are
eligible to participate after the closing, Microsoft has agreed that it will:
provide that each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate in each Microsoft
plan, without any waiting period, to the extent that coverage under the Microsoft plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Activision Blizzard plan;
cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements under any Microsoft plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any continuing employee to be waived for the
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived under the
corresponding Activision Blizzard plan;
cause any eligible expenses incurred by a continuing employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Activision Blizzard plan ending on the date that the
continuing employee’s participation in the corresponding Microsoft plan begins to be given full
credit under the Microsoft plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to the continuing employee and his or her covered dependents

If the merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote (whether in person or by proxy) in favor of the
adoption of the merger proposal and who properly exercise and perfect their demand for appraisal of their
shares and who do not withdraw such demand or lose their right to appraisal will be entitled to appraisal
rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as “Section 262.”
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the
DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement
as Annex B and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or
other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights
under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock is entitled to
demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. All references in Section 262 and in
this summary to a “stockholder” or a “holder of shares” are to the record holder of shares unless otherwise
noted. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Activision Blizzard common stock held of record in
the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record
holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If
you hold your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you
wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.
Under Section 262, holders of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock who (i) do not vote in favor of the
merger proposal; (ii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time; and (iii)
otherwise follow the procedures set forth in, and do not otherwise withdraw or lose their rights under,
Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
and to receive, in lieu of the merger, consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware to be the “fair value” of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with
interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the court (subject, in the case
of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the surviving corporation pursuant to
subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, in its
discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and
compound quarterly from the effective date of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such
period; provided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware enters judgment in
the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount
in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (i) the
difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary
payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary
cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware
that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the
same as or less than the $95.00 per share consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement if they did
not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,
the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to
appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy
statement constitutes Activision Blizzard’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection
with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. In connection with
the merger, any holder of shares of Activision Blizzard’s common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so should review Annex B carefully. Failure to
comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal
rights under the DGCL. In addition, assuming our shares remain listed on a national securities exchange
immediately prior to the effective time (which we expect to be the case), the Delaware Court of Chancery will
dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Activision Blizzard stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (i)
the total number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock for
101 • 
• 
• 
• 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Activision
Blizzard common stock measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (ii) the
value of the aggregate merger consideration in respect of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock for
which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. We refer to these requirements
as the ownership conditions. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek
appraisal of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, Activision Blizzard believes that if a stockholder is
considering exercising appraisal rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. A
stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration as
described in the merger agreement upon surrender of the certificates that formerly represented such shares
of Activision Blizzard common stock.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Activision Blizzard common
stock must fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal;
the stockholder must deliver to Activision Blizzard a written demand for appraisal before the vote on
the merger proposal at the special meeting;
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the
effective time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before
the effective time); and
the stockholder (or a beneficial owner of shares on whose behalf the stockholder demanded
appraisal) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective
date of the merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no
intention of doing so.",112,113
"Activision Blizzard, Inc._20220321_DEFM14A_19960426_4418687.Pdf",Filing Written Demand,"Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver
to Activision Blizzard, before the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting, a written demand for
the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal
either in person or by proxy. A holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock exercising appraisal
rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue
to hold the shares of record through the effective time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain
voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal, and it will cause a
stockholder to lose the stockholder’s right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written
demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the merger proposal or abstain from
voting on the merger proposal. However, neither voting against the merger proposal nor abstaining from
voting or failing to vote on the merger proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for
appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to
and separate from any proxy or vote on the merger proposal. A proxy or vote against the merger proposal will
not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote
on the merger proposal at the special meeting will cause the stockholder to lose its appraisal rights in
connection with the merger.
Only a holder of record of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights
for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Activision
Blizzard common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably
inform Activision Blizzard of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand
appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a
fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on
behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as in a joint
tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for
102 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and
expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.
A holder of record, such as a brokerage, bank or other nominee, who holds shares of Activision Blizzard
common stock as nominee or intermediary for others may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising appraisal rights
for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Activision
Blizzard common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Activision Blizzard
common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Activision Blizzard
common stock held in the name of the holder of record.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER
NOMINEE FORMS, AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH
THEIR BROKERS, BANKS AND OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A
DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN
SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR
OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY
AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Any holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding
or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the
merger consideration by delivering to Activision Blizzard a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand
made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of the surviving
corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be dismissed
without the approval of such court and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court
deems just; provided that this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced
an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after the effective date of the

Chancery of the State of Delaware, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition
filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders
entitled to appraisal. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal. If a petition for appraisal is not
timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and

After determining the holders of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware will appraise the “fair value” of the shares of Activision Blizzard common
stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The appraisal
proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. In determining fair value, the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an
appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered,
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of
Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of
value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment
or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value,
including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger
and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so
determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could be more than, the same as or less than
the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares
104 TABLE OF CONTENTS
and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Activision Blizzard believes that the merger consideration is fair,
no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in
a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration. Neither Activision
Blizzard nor Microsoft anticipates offering more than the $95.00 per share consideration to any stockholder
of Activision Blizzard exercising appraisal rights. Each of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft reserves the right
to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of
Activision Blizzard common stock is less than the $95.00 per share consideration.
Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common
stock entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may,
in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders
entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock whose name appears on
the verified list and, if such shares are represented by certificates and if so required, who has submitted such
stockholder’s certificates of Activision Blizzard common stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will
be made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock, forthwith, and in the case of
holders of shares represented by certificates, upon the surrender to the surviving corporation of the
certificate(s) representing such stock. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other
decrees in such court may be enforced.
Unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and
the date of payment of the judgment; provided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the
amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of
the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (ii) any interest accrued
prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal
proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined
by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a
stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Activision Blizzard common stock under
Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the
stockholder’s shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the
effective time into the right to receive the merger consideration less applicable withholding taxes. A
stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for
appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, if neither of the ownership conditions
is satisfied or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the effective time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote
Activision Blizzard common stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions
on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of Activision Blizzard common
stock, if any, payable to stockholders of Activision Blizzard of record as of a time prior to

the effective time; provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers
to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the
merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of
the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is
filed with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be
dismissed as to any stockholder of Activision Blizzard without the approval of the court; provided that this
provision will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept
the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.
Failure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder of Activision Blizzard wishing to exercise appraisal
rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the
same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those
stockholders. As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement is being delivered to
stockholders residing at the same address, unless stockholders have notified the company whose shares
they hold of their desire to receive multiple copies of this proxy statement. This process, which is commonly
referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for
companies. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a
separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of this proxy statement and wish to receive
only one copy, please contact Activision Blizzard at the address identified below. Activision Blizzard will
promptly deliver, upon oral or written request, a separate copy of this proxy statement to any stockholder

APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS 
DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW
§ 262. Appraisal rights.
Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making
of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who
continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has
otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be
entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of
stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this
section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words
“stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
“depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an
interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is
deposited with the depository.
Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger
effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of
this title:
Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares
of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the
record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger
pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were
either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock
of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval
the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the
holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant
to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:
Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or
consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;
Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which
shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the
effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;
Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional
shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b.
and c. of this section.
In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected
under § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger,
appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.(4)

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Repealed by 82 Laws 2020, ch. 256, § 15.
Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this
section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an
amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation
is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If
the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including
those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this
section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less
than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available
pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all
of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of
this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall
deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a
written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may be
delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand
will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and
that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A
proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein
provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the
surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented
to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become
effective; or
If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this
title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify
each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal
rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent
corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if
given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such
stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to
appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a
merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice,
demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s
shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission
if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose
in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal
of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second
notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of
any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights
of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within
B-2 
(e) 
(f) 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved
pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice,
such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights
and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection.
An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the
stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in
advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,
provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the
notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section
hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all
such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section
hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall
be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation
a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate
number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were
the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer
referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have
been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given
to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s request for such a statement is received
by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of
such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.
Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon
the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the
office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with
whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or
resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the
petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered
by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by
registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown
on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation
published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable.
The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs
thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied
with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the
stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of
the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such
direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the
merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as
to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding
shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the
merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall
be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine
the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into
account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5%
over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation
may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall
accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest
theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting
corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court
may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled
to appraisal rights under this section.
The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by
the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so
made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the
Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a
corporation of this State or of any state.
The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the
Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may
order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.
From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for
any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the
effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an
appraisal

TABLE OF CONTENTS
shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall
deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand
for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an
appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of
Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this
provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting
stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall
have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

The Board of Directors:
We understand that Activision Blizzard, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Activision Blizzard”), Microsoft
Corporation, a Washington corporation (“Microsoft”), and Anchorage Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”). As more fully described in the Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will be
merged with and into Activision Blizzard, with Activision Blizzard continuing as the surviving corporation
and a subsidiary of Microsoft (the “Merger”), and (ii) each outstanding share of the common stock, par

the right to receive $95.00 per share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the
Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
Allen & Company LLC (“Allen & Company”) has acted as a financial advisor to Activision Blizzard in
connection with the proposed Merger and has been asked to render an opinion to the Board of Directors of
Activision Blizzard (the “Board”) as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Activision
Blizzard Common Stock, other than as specified below, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such
holders pursuant to the Agreement. For such services, Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay to Allen &
Company cash fees, of which a portion is payable upon the delivery of this opinion (the “Opinion Fee”) and
the principal portion is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. No portion of the Opinion Fee is
contingent upon either the conclusion expressed in this opinion or successful consummation of the Merger.
Activision Blizzard also has agreed to reimburse Allen & Company’s reasonable expenses and to indemnify
Allen & Company and related parties against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.
Allen & Company, as part of our investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements and related
financings, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. As the Board is aware, although Allen & Company is not
currently providing, and during the past two years has not provided, investment banking services to
Activision Blizzard unrelated to the Merger or to Microsoft for which Allen & Company has received
compensation, Allen & Company in the future may provide such services to Activision Blizzard, Microsoft
and/or their respective affiliates, for which Allen & Company would expect to receive compensation. In the
ordinary course, Allen & Company as a broker-dealer and certain of Allen & Company’s affiliates, directors
and officers have invested or may invest, hold long or short positions and may trade, either on a
discretionary or non-discretionary basis, for their own or beneficiaries’ accounts or for those of Allen &
Company’s clients, in the debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) of Activision Blizzard,
Microsoft and/or their respective affiliates. The issuance of this opinion has been approved by Allen &
Company’s opinion committee.
Our opinion as expressed herein reflects and gives effect to our general familiarity with Activision Blizzard
and the industry in which Activision Blizzard operates as well as information that we received during the
course of this assignment, including information provided by the management of Activision Blizzard in the
course of discussions relating to the Merger as more fully described below. In arriving at our opinion, we
neither conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Activision Blizzard or any other
entity nor made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities (contingent, accrued,
derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of Activision Blizzard or any other entity, or conducted any
analysis concerning the solvency or fair value of Activision Blizzard or any other entity. We have not
investigated, and express no opinion or view regarding, any actual or potential litigation, proceedings or
claims involving or impacting Activision Blizzard or any other entity and we have assumed, with your",207,207

(a) Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following will occur:
(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon
each certificate representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will
thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;
(ii) (A) each share of Company Common Stock that is (x) held by the Company as treasury stock
(but excluding the Specified Owned Company Shares); (y) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (z)
owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub other than the
Specified Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Effective Time ((x), (y) and (z), collectively, the
“Cancelled Owned Company Shares”) will be cancelled without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor; and (B) the Specified Owned Company Shares will remain outstanding
and unaffected by the Merger; and
(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
(b) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if required by the DGCL
(but only to the extent required thereby), all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who
have neither voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and
who have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting
Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.7 and instead will entitle the holders thereof to such rights
as are granted to such holders by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each Dissenting Company Share held
by a Company Stockholder who has failed to perfect or who has effectively withdrawn or lost his,
her or its rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Share pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share that
formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.
(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice and copies of any written demands for
appraisal, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to the Company
Stockholders’ demands of appraisal and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and Legal
Proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal under the DGCL, including any determination
to make any payment to any holder of Dissenting Company Shares with respect to any of their
Dissenting Company Shares under Section 262(h) of the DGCL prior to the entry of judgment in the
Legal Proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisals, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(a) Surrendered Company Options. Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) will become
vested by its terms without any action taken by the Company, the Company Board or a compensation
committee of the Company Board upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (each, a “Surrendered
Company Option”) will, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon
exercise of such Surrendered Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, less the
applicable exercise price for each such share of Company Common Stock under such Surrendered
Company Option and any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with 
Section 2.12. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise price per share under any
Surrendered Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Surrendered
Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no
further force or effect.
(b) Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards. Each Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) that will become vested by its terms without any action taken by the Company, the Company
Board or the compensation committee of the Company Board upon the occurrence of the Effective Time

the Effective Time that is not a Surrendered Company Option and that has an exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock that is less than the Merger Consideration (each, an “Assumed
Company Option”) will, as of the Effective Time, be, as determined by Parent, (x) assumed by Parent
and converted into a nonqualified stock option or (y) converted into a nonqualified stock option
granted pursuant to the Parent Stock Plan (in each case, with the terms and conditions relating to
vesting and exercisability to remain the same with respect to Company Options subject to time-
based vesting, and with respect to Company Options subject to performance-based vesting

performance levels) that shall vest at the conclusion of the original performance period, it being
understood that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a “change in control”

number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined based on target
performance levels) multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the exercise price of such Company Option, as applicable
immediately before the Effective Time divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) and in all cases in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. If the
foregoing calculation results in an Assumed Company Option being exercisable for a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock, then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Assumed Company Option will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. As a
result of any such conversion provided for in clause (y) above, any such Assumed Company
Options shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Stock Plan and grant
agreements for the Assumed Company Options (rather than the terms and conditions of the
Company Stock Plan and grant agreements under which the Assumed Company Options were

2.8 Equity Awards.
(a) Surrendered Company Options. Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) will become
vested by its terms without any action taken by the Company, the Company Board or a compensation
committee of the Company Board upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (each, a “Surrendered
Company Option”) will, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon
exercise of such Surrendered Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, less the
applicable exercise price for each such share of Company Common Stock under such Surrendered
Company Option and any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with 
Section 2.12. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise price per share under any
Surrendered Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Surrendered
Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no
further force or effect.
(b) Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards. Each Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) that will become vested by its terms without any action taken by the Company, the Company
Board or the compensation committee of the Company Board upon the occurrence of the Effective Time

Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award, less any applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with
Section 2.12.
(c) Assumed Company Awards.
(i) Assumed Company Options. Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time that is not a Surrendered Company Option and that has an exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock that is less than the Merger Consideration (each, an “Assumed
Company Option”) will, as of the Effective Time, be, as determined by Parent, (x) assumed by Parent
and converted into a nonqualified stock option or (y) converted into a nonqualified stock option
granted pursuant to the Parent Stock Plan (in each case, with the terms and conditions relating to
vesting and exercisability to remain the same with respect to Company Options subject to time-
based vesting, and with respect to Company Options subject to performance-based vesting
converted into time-based vesting Assumed Company Options (determined based on target
performance levels) that shall vest at the conclusion of the original performance period, it being
understood that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a “change in control”

number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined based on target
performance levels) multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the exercise price of such Company Option, as applicable
immediately before the Effective Time divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) and in all cases in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. If the
foregoing calculation results in an Assumed Company Option being exercisable for a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock, then the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Assumed Company Option will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. As a
result of any such conversion provided for in clause (y) above, any such Assumed Company
Options shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Stock Plan and grant
agreements for the Assumed Company Options (rather than the terms and conditions of the
Company Stock Plan and grant agreements under which the Assumed Company Options were
originally issued), subject to the foregoing sentence of this Section 2.8(c)(i). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, Parent may elect to treat some or all of the Company Options
that would otherwise be Assumed Company Options that
A-18 TABLE OF CONTENTS
are scheduled to vest within 120 days following the Closing Date as vested Surrendered Company
Options, which will be settled in accordance with Section 2.8(a), but the vesting of such Company
Options will be fully accelerated prior to such treatment, except that the applicable settlement date
may be delayed to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event that the exercise price per share under any Company Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall not become an Assumed Company Option
and shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no further
force or effect.
(ii) Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards. Each Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award
(each, an “Assumed Company Stock-Based Award”), will, as of the Effective Time, be, as determined
by Parent, (x) assumed by Parent and converted into a stock-based award or (y) converted into a
stock-based award granted pursuant to the Parent Stock Plan (in each case, with the terms and
conditions relating to vesting to remain the same with respect to Company Stock-Based Awards
subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to Company Stock-Based Awards subject to
performance-based vesting converted into time-based vesting Assumed Company Stock-Based
Awards (determined based on target performance levels) that shall vest at the conclusion of the
original performance period, it being understood that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement constitute a “change in control” for purposes of the Company Stock Plans and award
agreements thereunder), in respect of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Stock-Based Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (determined based on target performance levels) multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio. As a result of any such conversion provided for in clause (y) above, any such Assumed
Company Stock-Based Awards shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Parent
Stock Plan and grant agreements for the Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards (rather than the
terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan and grant agreements under which the Assumed
Company Stock-Based Awards were originally issued), subject to the foregoing sentence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, Parent may elect to treat some or all
Company Stock-Based Awards that would otherwise be Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards as
vested Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards, which will be settled in accordance with
Section 2.8(b), but the vesting of such Company Stock-Based Awards will be fully accelerated prior
to such treatment, except that the applicable settlement date may be delayed to the extent required
by Section 409A of the Code.
(iii) Non-U.S. Grantees. If the treatment of a non-U.S. grantee’s Company Option or Company
Stock-Based Award specified in this Section 2.8(c) would otherwise be prohibited, subject to
onerous regulatory requirements, or subject to adverse tax treatment under the laws of the
applicable jurisdiction (as reasonably determined by Parent), then this Section 2.8(c) shall not
apply, and Parent shall provide compensation to the holder of such Company Option or Company
Stock-Based Award that is equivalent in value to the value described in this Section 2.8(c), to the
extent practicable and as would not result in the imposition of additional taxes under Section 409A
of the Code, in the form of a cash payment which will be reduced by any applicable Taxes or a new
equity award, as reasonably determined by Parent.
(d) Actions Related to Assumed Awards. Parent will take such actions as are reasonably necessary, if
any, to reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company Stock-
Based Awards. Effective as of the Effective Time, to the extent the Assumed Company Options and
Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards are not already registered by Parent under the Securities Act,
Parent will cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the Securities Act, with respect
to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Company Options and Assumed
Company Stock-Based Awards. Parent will use the same level of efforts that it uses to maintain the
effectiveness of its other registration statements on Form S-8 (or other applicable
A-19 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
form) to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any Assumed Company
Options and Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding.
(e) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, will adopt any resolutions and take any
actions within its authority with respect to the Company Stock Plans and the award agreements
thereunder as it deems reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.8, including (i) providing notice to each holder of a Company Option or Company Stock-Based
Award in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent of the treatment of the Company Options or Company
Stock-Based Awards set forth in this Agreement and (ii) satisfying all applicable requirements of Rule
16b-3(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company will provide Parent with drafts of, and a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon (and Parent’s review and delivery of comments will
occur promptly after the Company provides Parent with such drafts and the Company’s acceptance of
Parent’s reasonable comments will not be unreasonably withheld), all notices, resolutions and other
written actions or communications as may be required to give effect to the provisions of this Section
2.8.
(f) Payment Procedures. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with
the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate amount owed to holders of
Surrendered Company Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards. As promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than five Business Days
following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Surrendered Company Options and Surrendered
Company Stock-Based Awards will receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in
respect of Surrendered Company Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards that are
cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable. All such payments
will be less any applicable withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a
holder of Surrendered Company Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards pursuant to
Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable, cannot be made through the Company’s or the Surviving
Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for
such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly
following the Closing Date (but in no event more than five Business Days thereafter). All such
payments will be less any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable
Law to be withheld.
(g) Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any Company
Option or Company Stock-Based Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code and that the Company determines prior to the Effective Time is not eligible to
be canceled in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such payment will be
made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Option or Company Stock-Based
Award that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(a) Paying Agent and Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will enter into a customary
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company with a paying agent designated by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the per share
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.7(a)(iii). At or promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately
available funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments in respect of Company Common Stock under Section 2.7(a)(iii) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the “Exchange Fund”) in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common
Stock. The Paying Agent will deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 2.7 out
of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in Section 2.7, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any
other purpose.
(b) Exchange Procedures. Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three Business Days thereafter), to each
A-20 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common
Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Common Stock will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Common Stock to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates evidencing such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate” and together, the “Certificates”) or the non-
certificated shares of Company Common Stock (“Book-Entry Shares”) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in Section 2.11) for cancellation to the Paying Agent in the case of a transfer of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by Certificates or receipt by the Paying Agent of an agent’s message in the
case of a transfer of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed (in the
case of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates), and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such materials and
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
for the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate and for such Book-
Entry Shares, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as
promptly as practicable, in respect of such Certificate and Book-Entry Shares, the amount of Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to pursuant to Section 2.7. The Certificates so surrendered
and the Book-Entry Shares of such holders will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.
(c) Investment of Exchange Fund. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the cash in the Exchange Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any
agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a
maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). If (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund;
(B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7(a)(iii); or (C) all or any portion of the
Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Paying Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the
cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7(a)(iii) for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a)(iii). Any income
from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent
directs.
(d) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if any Merger Consideration is to be
paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or transferred
in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, Merger
Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and
transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or established to the satisfaction of
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not
payable.
(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the
Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of
A-21 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not
have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.
(f) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest
or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange
pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), as general creditors thereof,
for any claim to the Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section
2.7.

Consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(iii), or in the case of Dissenting Company
Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(b). The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock other than the Specified
Owned Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time. Other than with respect to Specified Owned Company Shares, if, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will
(subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9) be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.
2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Either of
Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.
2.12 Required Withholding. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation,
or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options such amounts as
will be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax laws. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld they will be (a) paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority
and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

Subsidiaries (including all notes thereto) filed with the Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or as otherwise permitted by
Form 10-Q with respect to any financial statements filed on Form 10-Q); and (ii) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the

unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of the type required
to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.
(b) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company has established and maintains “disclosure
controls and procedures” and “internal control over financial reporting”  (in each case as defined
pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act). The Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i) material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes pursuant to the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The

control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and such assessment concluded that such
system was effective. The Company’s independent registered public accountant has issued (and not
subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Since December 31, 2020, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no events, facts or circumstances have occurred such that management
would not be able to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, and conclude, after such assessment, that such system
was effective. Since January 1, 2019, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January 1, 2019, neither
the Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received notice from any

3.9 Company SEC Reports. Since January 1, 2019, the Company has filed all forms, reports and documents
with the SEC that have been required to be filed by it pursuant to applicable Laws prior to the date of this
Agreement (the “Company SEC Reports”). Each Company SEC Report complied, as of its filing date, or, if
amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the
last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date of this Agreement, in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case
may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date that
such Company SEC Report was filed. True, correct and complete copies of all Company SEC Reports are
publicly available in the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval database of the SEC. As of its
filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such
amended or superseded filing), each Company SEC Report did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to
file any forms, reports or documents with the SEC.
3.10 Company Financial Statements; Internal Controls; Indebtedness.
(a) Company Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including all notes thereto) filed with the Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or as otherwise permitted by
Form 10-Q with respect to any financial statements filed on Form 10-Q); and (ii) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows and stockholders’ equity for
the periods then ended. Except as have been described in the Company SEC Reports, there are no
unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of the type required
to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.
(b) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company has established and maintains “disclosure
controls and procedures” and “internal control over financial reporting”  (in each case as defined
pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act). The Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i) material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes pursuant to the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and such assessment concluded that such
system was effective. The Company’s independent registered public accountant has issued (and not
subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Since December 31, 2020, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no events, facts or circumstances have occurred such that management
would not be able to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, and conclude, after such assessment, that such system
was effective. Since January 1, 2019, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January 1, 2019, neither
the Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received notice from any
Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing of such certifications.
(c) Internal Controls. The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls that are effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, including
A-27 TABLE OF CONTENTS​
policies and procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of the Company’s
management and the Company Board; and (iii) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm has identified or been made aware of (A) any “significant deficiency”
or “material weakness”  (each as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) in the system of internal
control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries that has not been
subsequently remediated; or (B) any fraud that involves the Company’s management or other
employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal control over
financial reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person or its Representatives (including, for
these purposes, sources of financing) that has made or delivered to the Company a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result or arise from a breach of
Section 5.3(a), but only if the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with the
Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (ii) the failure
to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(b) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable Law. In connection with the foregoing, the Company will prior to or
contemporaneously make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was not previously made
available to Parent.

Business Days, then within one Business Day after Parent so requests); (D) take any formal action
or make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being

understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th Business Day after
the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal
without such action being considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A)
through (E), a “Company Board Recommendation Change”), it being understood that neither (1) the
determination in itself by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal nor (2) the delivery in itself by the
Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(d) will constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.3; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
(d) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval:
(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response
to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law and then if and only if:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three Business Days in
advance to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i), which
notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, during such three Business Day period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and
its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests in writing to so negotiate)
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company
Board no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; and (B) provided Parent and its
Representatives with an opportunity to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding
this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to
make such a presentation); or
(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
has concluded in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:
(1) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
(2) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3; and
(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three Business Days in
advance (the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board has (A) received a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a

Corporation to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company pursuant to any
indemnification agreements set forth on Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in effect on the
date of this Agreement between the Company, on the one hand, and any of its current or former
A-53 TABLE OF CONTENTS
directors and officers, on the other hand, and the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the Charter and the Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement
with respect to any of the Company’s current or former directors and officers (collectively, the
“Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Persons as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the Charter and the Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such
provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.8(a),
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification
agreements set forth on Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with
any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such
Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action
or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether
such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time);
and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect
thereto, except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified
Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section
6.8(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the
Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time; (B)
each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of
which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to
control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees
and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the
defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is
not entitled to be indemnified; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such
Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective
Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or
otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of
such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of
any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent
legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to
such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
(“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms
(including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are
A-54 
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8(c),
the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 350% of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth on Section 6.8(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (such 350% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving
Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time,
and in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Company may (or if
Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the
Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail”
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such “tail”
policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.8.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.8 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person
who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person
or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the
D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O
Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant
to this Section 6.8 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the
Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).
(f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or
impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy
or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective
Time.
(b) Employment; Benefits. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time by taking such actions, if any, as are
required by applicable Law. Subject to the terms of any Collective Bargaining Agreement, for a period of
twelve months following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the

awards are granted) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Plans”) at
benefit levels that are, in the aggregate, no less than those in effect at the Company or its applicable
Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide target cash compensation and benefits (other
than any equity-based compensation, retention, transaction, milestone or other one-time bonus or
payment) to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii) provide target cash
compensation (other than any equity-based compensation, retention, transaction, milestone or other
one-time bonus or payment), benefits and severance payments to each Continuing Employee that, taken
as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the target cash compensation (other than any
equity-based compensation, retention, transaction, milestone or other one-time bonus or payment),
benefits and severance payments provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time (“Comparable Plans”); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and
Comparable Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives target cash compensation, benefits and
severance payments that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the target cash
compensation (other than any equity-based compensation, retention, transaction, milestone or other
one-time bonus or payment), benefits and severance payments and benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
6.9(b) to the contrary, standard Parent compensation, benefits and/or severance that is provided to any
Continuing Employee that would be provided to a similarly situated Parent employee shall be deemed to
satisfy Parent’s, the Surviving Corporation’s and any Subsidiary’s obligations under this Section 6.9(b).
(c) New Plans. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to any
Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such
Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement
to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement, but excluding for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or post-employment welfare plan), except that such service need not be credited to the
extent that it would result in duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any

any liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “willful breach”
means a material breach that is a consequence of an act taken by the breaching party, or the failure by
the breaching party to take an act it is required to take under this Agreement, in each case with actual
knowledge that the taking of, or the failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably expected to,
cause a breach of this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement will
affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, which rights,
obligations and agreements will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms.

the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be
responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.
(b) Company Termination Fee.
(i) Future Transaction. If (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (1) Section 8.1(c), and at the
time of such termination, either (x) the Company Stockholder Meeting has not yet been held or (y)
the condition in Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(d) has not been satisfied
A-64 TABLE OF CONTENTS
and the primary cause of the failure of either such condition to be satisfied was a breach of any
provision of this Agreement by the Company, (2) Section 8.1(d) or (3) Section 8.1(e); (B) following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e) an Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced (i) on or prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, with respect to
any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or (ii) on or prior to the date of such termination, with
respect to any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(e); and (C) within one year of
such termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e),
either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive
agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company will
promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) after the earlier of the (1) entry into such
definitive agreement or (2) consummation of such Acquisition Transaction pay to Parent (or its
designee) an amount equal to $2,270,100,000 (the “Company Termination Fee”) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. For
purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “15%” in the definition of “Acquisition
Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%.”
(ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(f), then the Company will promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) following such
termination pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.
(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the
Company will concurrently with such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent.
(c) Parent Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) Section 8.1(b) due to an
Injunction arising from Antitrust Laws or (y) Section 8.1(c) and all conditions to this Agreement are
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of
which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or waived (where permissible pursuant to applicable
Law), other than the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d) (solely in connection with an
Antitrust Law), and, in either case of clause (x) or (y), the Company is not then in material breach of any
provision of this Agreement (provided that any breach by the Company that is the primary cause of the
failure of any condition to this Agreement to be satisfied shall be considered a material breach), then
Parent shall promptly pay (or cause to be paid) to the Company (i) if such termination notice is provided
prior to January 18, 2023, an amount equal to $2,000,000,000, (ii) if such termination notice is provided
after January 18, 2023, and prior to April 18, 2023, an amount equal to $2,500,000,000 or (iii) if such
termination notice is provided at any time after April 18, 2023, an amount equal to $3,000,000,000 (any
fee payable pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii), the “Parent Termination Fee”) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Company.
(d) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion and in no event will Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of
this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.
(e) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an
integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if a Party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or
Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party commences a Legal Proceeding that
results in a judgment against such Party for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c) or
any portion thereof, the Party that has failed to make such payment will pay to the other Party its out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Legal Proceeding,
together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate of the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion

APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS 
DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW
§ 262. Appraisal rights.
Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making
of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who
continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has
otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be
entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of
stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this
section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words
“stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
“depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an
interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is
deposited with the depository.
Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger
effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of
this title:
Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares
of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the
record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger
pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were
either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock
of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval
the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the
holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant
to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:
Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or
consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;
Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which
shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the
effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;
Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or
