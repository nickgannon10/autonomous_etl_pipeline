sickling in SCD. GBT is also advancing its pipeline program in SCD with inclacumab, a P-selectin inhibitor in Phase 3
development to address pain crises associated with the disease, and GBT021601 (GBT601), the Company’s next

solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Merger Sub has not
engaged in any business activities other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Upon the completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and GBT will continue as the

The Merger 
(page 25)
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (which we refer to as the “DGCL”), Merger Sub will merge with and into GBT (which we
refer to as the “Merger”), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and GBT will continue its
corporate existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation in the Merger (which we
1TABLE OF CONTENTS
refer to as the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, GBT common stock will no longer be publicly
traded and will be delisted from the Nasdaq. In addition, GBT common stock will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”), and GBT will no longer file periodic
reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the “SEC”). If the Merger is
completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger will become
effective at such time as the certificate of merger with respect to the Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by GBT and Merger Sub in writing and
specified in the certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL (which we refer to as the “Effective Time”).
Background of the Merger 
(page 27)
A description of the process we undertook that led to the Merger, including our discussions with Pfizer, is included in
this proxy statement under the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Background of the
Merger”.
Merger Consideration 
(page 26)
GBT Common Stock
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of GBT, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of GBT or Merger Sub, each share of GBT common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of GBT common stock owned by (a) the Company, any
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and
(b) stockholders of the Company who have validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal under Section 262 of
the DGCL, which we refer to, collectively, as “Excluded GBT Shares”) will be converted automatically into the right to
receive $68.50 in cash, without interest (which we refer to as the “Merger Consideration”) and subject to any required
tax withholding.
On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a designated paying agent a cash
amount that is sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all shares of GBT common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded GBT Shares). For more information, please
see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures”.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of
GBT common stock that you own (other than Excluded GBT Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject
to any required tax withholding), but you will no longer have any rights as a GBT stockholder (except that GBT
stockholders who properly and validly exercise and do not withdraw their appraisal rights will not be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration and instead shall have a right to receive payment of the “fair value” of their shares
as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by the DGCL). For more information, please see
the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights”.
Treatment of GBT Equity Awards 
(page 26)
At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, equity awards granted on or prior to the date of the
Merger Agreement that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as follows:
•
each outstanding option to purchase shares of GBT common stock, which we refer to as a “Company
Option”, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Company Option;
2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
each outstanding restricted stock unit of the Company subject only to service-based vesting requirements,
which we refer to as a “Company RSU”, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such Company RSU immediately
prior to the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration;
•
each outstanding restricted stock unit of the Company subject to performance-based vesting requirements,
which we refer to as a “Company PSU”, other than those tied to a price hurdle with respect to a share of
GBT common stock (and not relative total shareholder return), will be canceled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such
Company PSU immediately prior to the completion of the Merger (assuming that all applicable performance
measures are satisfied at the greater of (x) the target level of performance and (y) the actual level of
performance (measured as of the Effective Time)) and (ii) the Merger Consideration; and
•
each Company PSU with performance measures that are tied to a price hurdle with respect to a share of
GBT common stock (and not relative total shareholder return), which we refer to as a “Stock Price PSU”, will
be forfeited.
At the Effective Time, equity awards that may be granted to employees of the Company after the date of the Merger
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time and that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted into cash awards (based on the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of GBT
common stock subject to the applicable award immediately prior to the completion of the Merger) subject to the same
vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding award.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Merger
Consideration-Treatment of GBT Equity Awards”.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 
(page 65)
The exchange of GBT common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, for such purposes, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) who exchanges shares of GBT common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives pursuant to the
Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of GBT common stock surrendered by such U.S.
Holder pursuant to the Merger.
With respect to a non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of
the Merger Agreement-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of GBT
common stock for cash in the Merger generally will not result in tax to that non-U.S. Holder under U.S. federal income
tax laws unless that non-U.S. Holder has certain connections with the United States, but may be subject to backup
withholding tax unless the non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a
valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.
This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or other tax
consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law.
Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S.
tax consequences to you of the Merger.
Appraisal Rights 
(page 60)
If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares of GBT common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as “Section 262”)
and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value
of their shares of GBT common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (which we refer
3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to as the “Delaware Court”), together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
The “fair value” of your shares of GBT common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than,
or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement.
These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be
the “fair value” of their shares of GBT common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court.
Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of GBT common stock
determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth
in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result
in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of
Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors
before attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record of shares of GBT common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares
through the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise
withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not
thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a
person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the
demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement
that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at
which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery
List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-
Appraisal Rights”), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of GBT common stock exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware
Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a complete statement of
the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments
thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights
should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting
to exercise such rights. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Appraisal Rights”.
Litigation Related to the Merger
(page 65)
On August 22, 2022, a complaint, captioned Wang v. Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-07157,
was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a purported GBT stockholder,
and on August 26, 2022, a complaint, captioned Pepe v. Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:22-cv-
04895, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by a purported GBT
stockholder, in each case naming as defendants GBT and members of the Board. The complaints allege, among other
things, that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy
statement with the SEC relating to the Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14a-9 promulgated thereunder.
Among other remedies, the complaints seek an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger,
requiring the defendants to disclose allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the proxy
statement, rescinding the Merger in the event that it is consummated or granting rescissory damages, awarding
costs, including attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses, and granting such other and further relief as the court may
deem just and proper.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The defendants believe that the complaints are without merit and that no further disclosure is required to supplement
the proxy statement under applicable laws. As of August 26, 2022, GBT was not aware of the filing of other lawsuits
challenging the Merger or the proxy statement; however, such lawsuits may be filed in the future.
Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger 
(page 68)
U.S. Regulatory Clearances
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (which we refer to as the “HSR Act”), have expired or been terminated. GBT made the filing
required under the HSR Act on August 26, 2022, and we currently expect Parent to make the filing required under the
HSR Act by August 29, 2022, in which case the initial 30-day waiting period will be scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on September 28, 2022, unless otherwise extended.
Other Regulatory Clearances
The Merger is also subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions, including Germany. The
parties made the required filings with the German Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) on August 26, 2022. In
each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to consummate the Merger
or the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement-Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger”.
Parent is required to pay GBT a termination fee (the “Reverse Termination Fee”) equal to $326 million in connection
with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified antitrust related circumstances. For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination Fees”.

(page 87)
The obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary
conditions, including (among other conditions) the following:
•
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of GBT common stock;
•
the absence of any judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction in any jurisdiction in which
Parent or the Company has material business operations or law enacted by any governmental entity in any
such jurisdiction (which we refer to, collectively, as “Legal Restraints”) preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger;
•
(a) the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act; and (b)
all required consents and expirations or terminations of waiting periods (as applicable) with respect to
certain other required regulatory filings;
•
the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain
materiality qualifiers);
•
in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the absence, since August 7, 2022, of, subject to certain exceptions

and Warranties”, any change, event, condition, development, circumstance, effect or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, (a) has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse
effect on the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or impair the
consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“-Termination of the Merger Agreement”), in each case, that has occurred and is continuing; and
5
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the performance and compliance in all material respects by the parties of their respective covenants,
agreements and obligations required by the Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by such
party prior to the Effective Time.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to
the Closing of the Merger”.
Financing of the Merger 
(page 60)
There is no financing condition to the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub have represented in the Merger Agreement
that they have available funds sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement and, at the Effective Time, that Parent and
Merger Sub will have available all of the funds necessary for the acquisition of all shares of GBT common stock
pursuant to the Merger, as the case may be, to pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith and make payments
related to the treatment of GBT equity awards, and to perform their respective obligations under the Merger
Agreement.
Required Stockholder Approval 
(page 20)
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of GBT common stock entitled to vote
thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Merger Agreement Proposal”). As of
August 24, 2022 (which we refer to as the “Record Date”), 33,738,090 votes constitute a majority of the outstanding
shares of GBT common stock entitled to vote thereon. Approval of the proposal to approve, on an advisory
(nonbinding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to GBT’s named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(which we refer to as the “Compensation Proposal”) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of GBT
common stock properly cast for the Compensation Proposal. Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special
Meeting (which we refer to as the “Adjournment Proposal”) (a) when a quorum is present, requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of GBT common stock properly cast for and against the Adjournment Proposal, and
(b) when a quorum is not present, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of GBT common stock
representing a majority of the voting power present at the Special Meeting. The approval of the Compensation
Proposal is advisory (nonbinding) and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, 1,585,803 shares of GBT common stock, representing approximately 2.35% of the shares of GBT common
stock outstanding as of the Record Date.
We currently expect that each of our directors and executive officers will vote all of their respective shares of GBT
common stock: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
The Special Meeting 
(page 20)
Date, Time and Location
The Special Meeting to consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be held virtually via
live webcast on September 30, 2022, beginning at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or
postponed). GBT stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/GBT2022SM, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting website”. For purposes
of attendance at the Special Meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present” shall mean virtually present
at the Special Meeting.
We encourage you to access the Special Meeting before it begins. Online check-in will start approximately 15 minutes
before the Special Meeting is scheduled to begin.
6
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of GBT common stock at the close of business on
the Record Date. Each GBT stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each such share owned at the close of
business on the Record Date.
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 67,476,179 shares of GBT common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. The presence, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of GBT
common stock entitled to vote on the Record Date, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting.
Recommendation of the GBT Board of Directors 
(page 35)
The Board has unanimously: (a) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, GBT and its stockholders; (b) approved the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger
Agreement; (c) resolved to recommend that GBT stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement; and (d) directed that the
adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by GBT stockholders at the Special Meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the
Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by GBT stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Board may
withdraw, qualify or modify the foregoing recommendation under certain circumstances in response to an Intervening
Event (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement- Restrictions on Solicitation
of Company Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”) or in connection
with a Superior Company Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-
Restrictions on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation”).
However, the Board cannot effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals; The
Board’s Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”) unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger
Agreement, including negotiating with Parent in good faith over a three-business day period to amend or modify the
Merger Agreement to obviate the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change, after which the Board shall have
determined, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure of the Board to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. The termination of the Merger Agreement by Parent in the event of (1) an Adverse Recommendation
Change, (2) the Company’s failure to recommend rejection of a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes a
Company Takeover Proposal within ten (10) business days of the commencement of such tender offer or exchange
offer, or (3) publicly reaffirm the Board Recommendation within ten (10) business days of the written request of Parent
following the date any Company Takeover Proposal is first made public, or by GBT following the Board’s
authorization for GBT to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by
a Superior Company Proposal will result in the payment by GBT of a termination fee (the “Company Termination
Fee”) of $217 million. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Restrictions on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation”.

Opinion of Centerview Partners LLC
(page 45 and Annex C)
GBT retained Centerview Partners LLC (which we refer to as “Centerview”) as financial advisor to the Board in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (which we refer to,
collectively, as the “Transaction”). In connection with this engagement, the Board requested that Centerview
evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of GBT common stock (other than
Excluded Shares (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement-Opinion of Centerview”)) of the Merger Consideration proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to
the Merger Agreement. On August 7, 2022, Centerview rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 7, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon
and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations
upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders of shares of GBT common stock (other Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of Centerview’s written opinion, dated August 7, 2022, which describes the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by
Centerview in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by
reference. Centerview’s financial advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of
the Board (in the directors’ capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes
of its consideration of the Transaction and Centerview’s opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point
of view, as of the date thereof, to the holders of shares of GBT common stock (other than Excluded Shares) of the
Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Centerview’s opinion did not
address any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Transaction and does not constitute a
recommendation to any GBT stockholder or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should
vote with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Interests of GBT’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 
(page 56)
GBT’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of GBT stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these
interests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger Agreement and recommend that GBT stockholders
vote their GBT common shares to adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests may include the following:
•
each outstanding award of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs (other than Stock Price
PSUs) that was granted on or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive cash at the Effective Time (as described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards”);

Restrictions on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals 
(page 78)
Under the Merger Agreement, GBT may not: (a) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or
facilitate the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to any
Company Takeover Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-
Restrictions on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation”) or (b) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to
any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to assist, facilitate or encourage any effort by
any Person, in each case in connection with or in response to any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, under certain specified circumstances, until the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by GBT stockholders, GBT may, among other things, provide information to, and engage in discussions
or negotiations with, a person in respect of a Company Takeover Proposal if, subject to complying with certain
procedures, the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that
such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company
Proposal. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-
Restrictions on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation”.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by GBT stockholders, GBT is entitled to terminate the Merger
Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Company Proposal if it complies
with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including (a) giving Parent at least three business days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, (b) during such three-business day period, considering and
discussing with Parent in good faith any adjustments to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent and
(c) at the end of such three-business day period, the Board again determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that, after taking into account any adjustments to the terms of the Merger
Agreement proposed by Parent during such three-business day period, such Superior Company Proposal continues
to be a “Superior Company Proposal”.
The termination of the Merger Agreement by GBT in connection with the Board’s authorization for GBT to enter into
a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Company Proposal will
result in the payment by GBT of a termination fee of $217 million. For more information, please

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important
to you. You should carefully read and consider the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy
statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the

Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
The Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the GBT stockholders in connection with
the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the Special Meeting.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting is scheduled to be held virtually via live webcast on September 30, 2022, at 8:00 a.m. Pacific
Time (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed). There will not be a physical meeting location. In
light of continuing public health and travel concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, GBT believes hosting
a virtual meeting helps ensure the health and safety of its stockholders, the Board and GBT management.
Additionally, the virtual nature of the Special Meeting is generally designed to enable participation of and
access by more GBT stockholders while decreasing the cost of conducting the Special Meeting. GBT
stockholders will be able to virtually attend and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/GBT2022SM. Online check-in will start approximately 15 minutes before the
Special Meeting is scheduled to begin.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal;
•
to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and
•
to approve the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
GBT stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special
Meeting. Each holder of shares of GBT common stock shall be entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly
brought before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the close of business on the Record Date.
Virtual attendance at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website is not required to vote.
Q:
May I attend and vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
All GBT stockholders as of the Record Date may attend and vote at the Special Meeting.
Shares held directly in your name as a GBT stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the
Special Meeting website. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special
Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Even if you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or
by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The
Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting”) so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to or
become unable to virtually attend the Special meeting. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, your
vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.

1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $68.50 in cash,
without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, for each share of GBT common stock that you own
(other than Excluded GBT Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you have properly and validly
exercised and do not withdraw your appraisal rights in accordance with and complied with Section 262 of the
DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of GBT common stock (other than Excluded GBT Shares), you will
receive $6,850 in cash in exchange for your shares of GBT common stock, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?
A:
The exchange of GBT common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, for such purposes, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) who exchanges shares of GBT common stock for cash in the Merger generally
will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such
U.S. Holder receives pursuant to the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of GBT
common stock surrendered by such U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger.
With respect to a non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the
exchange of GBT common stock for cash in the Merger generally will not result in tax to that non-U.S. Holder
under U.S. federal income tax laws unless that non-U.S. Holder has certain connections with the United States,
but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification
procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger. This description does not address any non-U.S. tax consequences, nor does it address state, local or
other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
income tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state,
local and non-U.S. tax consequences to you of the Merger.
Q:
What will happen to outstanding GBT equity compensation awards in the Merger?
A:
At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, equity awards granted on or prior to the date of
the Merger Agreement that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as
follows:
•
each outstanding Company Option, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled in exchange for the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option;
•
each outstanding Company RSU will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to
the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration;
•
each outstanding Company PSU, other than Stock Price PSUs, will be canceled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such
Company PSU immediately prior to the completion of the Merger (assuming that all applicable performance
measures are satisfied at the greater of (x) the target level of performance and (y) the actual level of
performance (measured as of the Effective Time)) and (ii) the Merger Consideration; and
•
each outstanding Stock Price PSU will be forfeited.
At the Effective Time, equity awards that may be granted to employees of the Company after the date of the
Merger Agreement and prior to the Effective Time and that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into cash awards (based on the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number
of shares of GBT common stock subject to the applicable award immediately prior to the completion of the
Merger) subject to the same vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding award.

Consideration-Treatment of GBT Equity Awards”.
Q:
How do GBT’s directors and executive officers intend to vote?
A:
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, 1,585,803 shares of GBT common stock, representing approximately 2.35% of the shares of GBT
common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. Although none of the directors or executive officers is
obligated to vote to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, we currently
expect that each of our directors and executive officers will vote all of their respective shares of GBT common
stock: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
Do any of the Company’s directors or executive officers have any interests in the Merger that are different
from, or in addition to, my interests as a GBT stockholder?
A:
In considering the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting, you should be aware that GBT’s directors
and executive officers have financial interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of GBT stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests
in reaching the determination to approve the Merger Agreement and recommend that GBT stockholders vote
their GBT common shares to adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests may include the following:
•
each outstanding award of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs (other than Stock Price
PSUs) that was granted on or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive cash at the Effective Time (as described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement-Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards”);
•
each of the Company’s executive officers participates in the Company’s change in control severance plan
that provides severance and other benefits in the case of a “qualifying termination” on or following a
change of control, which will include the completion of the Merger (as described in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Interests of the Company’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Severance Entitlements”); and
•
the Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance
coverage under the Merger Agreement.
Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Interests
of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” for additional information about these
financial interests.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of GBT common stock entitled to vote
thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of GBT common stock properly cast for the Compensation Proposal is required to approve the
Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of either (a) a majority of the shares of GBT common stock
properly cast for and against the Adjournment Proposal, when a quorum is present, or (b) the affirmative vote of
the holders of the shares of GBT common stock representing a majority of the voting power present at the
Special Meeting, when a quorum is not present, is required, as applicable, for approval of the Adjournment
Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any GBT stockholder of record to: (a) submit a
signed proxy card; (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions
detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting”); or
(c) vote virtually at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement
Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,
the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present,
will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is present at the
Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal
but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal. Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but,
assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment
Proposal. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be
voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger
Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by GBT stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other
reason, GBT stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of GBT common stock. Instead, GBT will
remain an independent public company, GBT common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq
and registered under the Exchange Act, and GBT will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Under certain circumstances, GBT will be required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to $217 million and,
under certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay GBT a termination fee equal to $326 million. For
more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Termination
Fees”.
Q:
Why are GBT stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (nonbinding) vote to approve the Compensation
Proposal?
A:
The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require GBT to seek an advisory (nonbinding) vote with
respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger.
Q:
What will happen if GBT stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A:
Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with
respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on GBT. Therefore, if the
approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable
under the Compensation Proposal will be payable to GBT’s named executive officers in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable agreements, regardless of whether the Compensation Proposal is
approved.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement,
including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as
they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign,
date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant
your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting”), so that your
shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name”, please refer to the voting
instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q:
Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures”) will mail a check, or make a wire
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
transfer, to each holder of book-entry shares in an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of
Merger Consideration, without interest, to which such holder is entitled, as described in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Exchange and Payment Procedures”.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of GBT common stock after the Record Date but before
the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger
is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of GBT common stock after the Record Date but
before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you
and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies GBT in writing of
such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is
completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those
shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of GBT common stock after the
Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply
envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the
instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special
Meeting”).
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a GBT stockholder of record and holding shares in “street
name” as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you are considered to be the “stockholder of record” with respect to those shares. In this case,
this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by GBT.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of GBT common stock held in “street name”. In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to
you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the GBT
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee
how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the virtual
Special Meeting.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a GBT stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of GBT common stock are registered in your name
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
Internet: Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system is
available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 29, 2022. Once you enter the Internet
voting system, you can record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
•
Telephone: Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available
24 hours a day in the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 29, 2022. Once you enter the
telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change) your
voting instructions.
•
Mail: Mark your voting instructions on the card and sign, date and return it in the postage-paid envelope
provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
September 29, 2022.
•
At the Special Meeting: Shares held directly in your name as a GBT stockholder of record may be voted at
the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the
Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or
other nominee.
If your shares of GBT common stock are held “in street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee, the holder of
your shares will provide you with a copy of this proxy statement, a voting instruction form and directions on
how to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the Internet or by telephone.
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy to
ensure your vote is counted. We encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, both of
which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. You may still
attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat if you have already voted by proxy.
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the
Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy
card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be
responsible.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically
over the Internet or by telephone.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is a GBT stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares owned by such GBT
stockholder on their behalf. If you are a GBT stockholder of record, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by
telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares
beneficially in “street name”, you should follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee.
Q:
If a GBT stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name”, will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You
should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted
against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A:
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this proxy
statement. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may change or revoke your proxy by any of the
following actions:
•
You may vote again over the Internet or by telephone as instructed on your proxy card before the closing
of the voting facilities at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 29, 2022.
•
You may submit another properly signed proxy card with a later date, provided such proxy card is received
no later than the close of business on September 29, 2022.
•
You may send a signed written notice that you are revoking your proxy to GBT’s Secretary at 181 Oyster
Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080, provided such written notice is received no later than the
close of business on September 29, 2022.
•
You may attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat. Simply attending the virtual Special Meeting will not,
by itself, revoke your proxy.

Banks and Brokers may call collect: 1 (212) 750-5833
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
This means you own shares of GBT common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than
one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a GBT stockholder of record and other shares
through a broker, or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive
multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions
for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares
you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by
mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
Q:
How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address
with another GBT stockholder?
A:
The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for
proxy statements with respect to two or more GBT stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single
proxy statement to those GBT stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding”,
potentially provides extra convenience for GBT stockholders and cost savings for companies.
GBT and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to
multiple GBT stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been
received from the affected GBT stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding
and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of
these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your
broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or GBT if you are a GBT stockholder of record by making a
request to our Secretary at 181 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080 or by calling (650) 741-
7700. In addition, GBT will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number
above, a separate copy of the proxy statement.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In
addition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, GBT will file the final voting
results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been certified, the preliminary results)
with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A:
GBT has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting.
GBT expects to pay Innisfree M&A Incorporated a fee of $37,500, plus certain costs associated with additional
services, as necessary, and Innisfree M&A Incorporated will be reimbursed for certain out-of-pocket fees and
expenses. GBT has agreed to indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against various liabilities and expenses
that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).
GBT also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective
agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of GBT common stock. GBT
directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They
will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.

Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We currently expect to complete the Merger as early as the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of

in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control. For
more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to
the Closing of the Merger”.
Q:
How can I obtain additional information about GBT?

GBT will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2022 Annual
Report to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,
without charge to any GBT stockholder who makes a request in writing or by telephone to GBT’s Investor
Relations Department at 181 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080 or (650) 741-7700. In order

The information contained in this proxy statement regarding the proposed merger, the expected timetable for
completing the proposed merger, future financial and operating results and benefits of the proposed merger, future
opportunities for the combined entity, general business outlook and any other statements may include “forward-
looking statements”. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed
forward-looking statements, including all statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectation of the
companies and members of their senior management team. Readers can generally identify forward-looking statements
by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “outlook”, “potential”, “continue”, “may”, “seek”,
“approximately”, “predict”, “believe”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “poised”, “estimate” or “anticipate” and similar
expressions or the negative versions of these words or comparable words, as well as future or conditional verbs such
as “will”, “should”, “would”, “likely” and “could”. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation,
statements regarding the transactions and related matters; prospective performance and opportunities; post-closing
operations and the outlook for the companies’ businesses; filings and approvals relating to the transactions; the
expected timing of the transactions; the ability to complete the transactions considering the various closing
conditions; and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-
looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We can give no assurance that the plans,
intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved, and, furthermore, actual results may differ
materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and will be affected by a variety of risks and
factors that are beyond our control, including, without limitation, uncertainties as to the timing of the transactions;
the risk that the transactions may not be completed in a timely manner or at all; risks and uncertainties related to
receiving the approval of GBT’s stockholders; the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for GBT
will be made; the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the transactions may
not be satisfied or waived, including the failure to receive any required regulatory approvals from any applicable
governmental entities (or any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on such approvals); the risks that drug-
related adverse events may be observed during commercialization or clinical development; the risk that data and
results may not meet regulatory requirements or otherwise be sufficient for further development, regulatory review or
approval; risks related to clinical trials and other studies (including the anticipated timing of clinical data, the funding
therefor, anticipated patient enrollment, trial outcomes, timing or associated costs); the occurrence of any event,
change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement for the transactions,
including in circumstances which would require GBT to pay a termination fee; the effect of the announcement or
pendency of the transactions on GBT’s ability to retain and hire key personnel, its ability to maintain relationships
with its third-party payors, customers, distributors, suppliers and others with whom it does business or its operating
results and business generally; risks related to diverting management’s attention from GBT’s ongoing business
operations; the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the transactions may result in significant costs of
defense, indemnification and liability; difficulties or unanticipated expenses in connection with integrating the
companies; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” and the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of GBT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 23, 2022, and in our
most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, as well as discussions of potential risks, uncertainties
and other important factors in our subsequent Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC. In
addition to the risks described above, other unknown or unpredictable factors also could affect GBT’s results. As a
result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this communication will prove to
be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In
light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as
a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified
time frame, or at all.
The forward-looking statements in this communication represent our views as of the date of this communication. We
anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to
update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we undertake no obligation to publicly update
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as
required by law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of
any date subsequent to the date of this communication. You should read this communication and the documents that
we reference in this communication completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be
materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary

Only GBT stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special
Meeting. A list of GBT stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal executive
offices located at 181 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080, during regular business hours for a
period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting, as well as on the Special Meeting website. If GBT’s
headquarters are closed during such period for health and safety reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the list
of GBT stockholders will be made available for inspection upon request to our Secretary at 181 Oyster Point
Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080, subject to the satisfactory verification of GBT stockholder status. The list
will also be available electronically during the Special Meeting on the Special Meeting website. As of the Record
Date, there were 67,476,179 shares of GBT common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.
The presence, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of GBT common stock
entitled to vote on the Record Date will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not
present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

Each GBT stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of GBT common stock owned at the close of
business on the Record Date.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of GBT common stock entitled to vote
thereon is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. As of the Record Date, 33,738,090 votes constitute a
majority of the outstanding shares of GBT common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by GBT stockholders
is a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of GBT common stock properly cast for the
Compensation Proposal is required to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
The affirmative vote of either (a) a majority of the shares of GBT common stock properly cast for and against the
Adjournment Proposal, when a quorum is present, or (b) the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of GBT
common stock representing a majority of the voting power present at the Special Meeting, when a quorum is not
present, is required, as applicable, for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, for GBT stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are
represented by proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the GBT stockholder
voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the
Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a
quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. A

so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a
matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular
proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific
voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. GBT does not expect any broker non-votes at the
Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with
discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine”, whereas each of the proposals to be
presented at the Special Meeting is considered “non-routine”. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your
shares of GBT common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on
how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by returning the proxy
card in advance by mail, over the Internet or by telephone. Although GBT offers four different voting methods, GBT
encourages you to vote over the Internet or by phone as GBT believes they are the most cost-effective methods. We
also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the Special Meeting, so that
the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective and
reliable alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares over the Internet or by
telephone, there is no need for you to submit your proxy card by mail.
To Vote Over the Internet:
Vote at www.proxyvote.com in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours per
day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 29, 2022. Once you enter the Internet voting system, you can record
and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
To Vote by Telephone:
Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours per day in
the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 29, 2022. Once you enter the telephone voting system, a
series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
To Vote by Proxy Card:
If you received a proxy card, mark your voting instructions on the card and sign, date and return it in the postage-
paid envelope provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on September 29, 2022.
All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received by the deadline indicated above will be voted
at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the GBT stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies
that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the
Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. If you indicate on your proxy card that you wish
to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the
21TABLE OF CONTENTS
Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal on a nonbinding advisory basis, your shares of GBT common
stock will be voted “FOR” each such proposal. Proxy cards that are returned without a signature will not be counted
as present at the Special Meeting and cannot be voted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank,
broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee
or attending the Special Meeting and voting using your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control number,
contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number so that you may vote. If such a service is
provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the
instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s,
broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other
nominee, if possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, it will have the same effect as if you
voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will not have any effect on
the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

•
if a proxy was submitted by telephone or over the Internet, by submitting another proxy by telephone or
over the Internet, in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Special Meeting-Voting at the Special Meeting” at any time before the closing of the voting facilities
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 29, 2022;
•
by submitting a properly signed and dated proxy card with a date later than the date of the previously

later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 29, 2022;
•
by delivering a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to GBT’s

provided such written notice is received no later than the close of business on September 29, 2022; or
•
by attending the virtual Special Meeting and voting thereat (your attendance at the virtual Special Meeting
will not, by itself, revoke your proxy).

Appraisal Rights",33,33

If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares of GBT common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are
strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of GBT common stock exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware
Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” of
your shares of GBT common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the
Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger Agreement. These rights are
known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be
the “fair value” of their shares of GBT common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court.
Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of GBT common stock
determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth
in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result
in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of
Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors
before attempting to exercise such rights.
A holder of record of shares of GBT common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares
through the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise
withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not
thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a
person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the
demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement
that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at
which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery
List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-
Appraisal Rights”), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of GBT common stock exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware
Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

The Company’s management and the Board regularly review the Company’s performance and prospects in light of its
business and developments in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. These reviews have included
consideration, from time to time, of potential partnerships, collaborations and other strategic transactions to enhance
stockholder value, including potential sale transactions. Such reviews have been accompanied by periodic
conversations between senior executives of the Company and their counterparts at other companies in such
industries regarding such potential transactions and opportunities.
On May 26, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted Dr. Ted W. Love, the Company’s President and Chief
Executive Officer, to schedule time to speak. The representative of Company A and Dr. Love spoke on June 2, 2022
and proposed a meeting between Dr. Love and representatives of Company A. On June 6, 2022, Dr. Love and Ms.
Jung E. Choi, the Company’s Chief Business and Strategy Officer, met with representatives of Company A. During
this meeting, the representatives of Company A provided a letter containing a non-binding proposal to acquire 100%
of the Company’s equity for $55.00 per share of GBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the “June 6
Company A Proposal”), which proposal represented a 111% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common
stock of $26.11 on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the June 6 Company A Proposal. The offer letter stated
that its submission had the support of Company A’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
On June 7, 2022, management of the Company apprised the Board of the June 6 Company A Proposal and a Board
meeting was scheduled for June 8, 2022 to discuss the June 6 Company A Proposal.
On June 8, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, a financial
advisor to the Company, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (which we refer to as “Cravath”) and Goodwin Procter
LLP (which we refer to as “Goodwin”), outside counsel to the Company, met virtually to discuss, among other topics,
the June 6 Company A Proposal. Dr. Love described to the Board his interactions with representatives of Company A
prior to and following the receipt of the June 6 Company A Proposal. Members of management briefed the Board on
the Company’s ongoing assessment of its long-range plans, which would be further discussed at the September 2022
strategic retreat, and the Company’s next steps in light of its receipt of the June 6 Company A Proposal.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan provided a market overview and their preliminary view of the June 6 Company A
Proposal, and representatives of Cravath reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties and other
legal matters. The Board determined to continue to consider the June 6 Company A Proposal, following a preliminary
financial analysis to be performed prior to the next Board meeting.
On June 8, 2022, the Company selected Centerview as an additional financial advisor to the Company (we refer to J.P.
Morgan and Centerview, collectively, as “the Company’s financial advisors”).
On June 14, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of Cravath and Goodwin, met
virtually for a regularly scheduled meeting during which, among other topics, the June 6 Company A Proposal was
discussed. At the meeting, a representative of Cravath reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties
and other legal matters. The Board and representatives of the Company’s financial advisors discussed, along with
members of management and representatives of Cravath and Goodwin, among other topics, the June 6 Company A
Proposal and certain strategic considerations in connection with a potential sale transaction, as well as an overview
of other potential acquirors of the Company. Representatives of the Company’s financial advisors presented their
preliminary financial review of the June 6 Company A Proposal based on preliminary financial projections provided
by management. Following discussion, the Board authorized the Company’s management, with the assistance of its
financial and legal advisors, to inform Company A that the June 6 Company A Proposal was insufficient from a
financial perspective. However, the Board authorized the Company’s management, with the assistance of the
Company’s financial advisors, to provide Company A with limited high-level information, upon execution of the
confidentiality agreement, in order to enable Company A to improve its offer price. The Board also authorized the
Company’s management, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, to solicit interest from additional
potential acquirors to gauge their interest in a potential transaction with the Company and, if a potential acquiror of
the Company indicated an interest in a potential transaction with the Company, to send such potential acquiror a
draft confidentiality agreement and,
27TABLE OF CONTENTS
TABLE OF CONTENTS
once entered into, commence discussions with such potential acquiror. In order to facilitate the Board providing
guidance to the Company’s management during the negotiations of the potential sale transaction, the Board adopted
resolutions forming a transaction committee (which we refer to as the “Transaction Committee”), consisting of Scott
Morrison, Mark Perry and Dawn Svoronos. The Board decided that, while the Transaction Committee would be
comprised of three members of the Board, all Board members would be invited to, and strongly encouraged to
participate in, any and all meetings of the Transaction Committee. Over the next several weeks, in addition to formal
Board meetings, Dr. Love and other members of the Company’s senior management periodically briefed and received
input from several Board members as to the discussions with representatives of certain of the potential acquirors.
On June 15, 2022, Dr. Love and Ms. Choi met virtually with representatives of Company A. Dr. Love informed the
representatives of Company A that the Board had determined that the June 6 Company A Proposal was insufficient
from a financial perspective, but that, following the execution by Company A of a confidentiality agreement, Dr. Love
and a limited number of other senior management of the Company would make themselves available for a
conversation to help Company A learn about the Company in order to facilitate an increase in Company A’s offer
price. The representatives of Company A informed the Company that Company A would send a diligence request list
that would help Company A better understand the value of the Company.
Later on June 15, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors provided a
confidentiality agreement to Company A, which was negotiated over the next several days among representatives of
the Company, Company A, Cravath and Company A’s outside counsel. The confidentiality agreement between the
Company and Company A was executed on June 18, 2022.
On June 16, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors spoke
telephonically with representatives of Pfizer to ask whether they would be interested in exploring a potential
acquisition of the Company. The following day, representatives of Pfizer contacted representatives of the Company’s
financial advisors to ask whether they could receive a management presentation. Following this conversation, at the
direction of the Board, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors provided a confidentiality agreement to
Pfizer, which was negotiated over the next several days among representatives of the Company, Pfizer and Cravath.
The confidentiality agreement between the Company and Pfizer was executed on June 27, 2022.
On June 17, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors spoke
telephonically with representatives of Company B to ask whether they would be interested in exploring a potential
acquisition of the Company. The following day, representatives of Company B contacted representatives of the
Company’s financial advisors to ask whether they could receive a management presentation. Following this
conversation, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors provided a
confidentiality agreement to representatives of Company B, which was negotiated over the next several days among
representatives of the Company, Company B and Cravath. The confidentiality agreement between the Company and
Company B was executed on June 26, 2022. All of the executed confidentiality agreements contained standstill
provisions, which automatically terminated upon the execution of the Merger Agreement.
Between June 15 and June 17, 2022, management spoke telephonically with one potential acquiror, and
representatives of the Company’s financial advisors, at the direction of the Board, contacted two other potential
acquirors, in each case that had been reviewed with the Board at the June 14 Board Meeting, all of whom declined to
pursue a potential acquisition of the Company.
Between June 24 and June 28, 2022, representatives of Pfizer, Company A and Company B separately met virtually
with the Company’s management for a presentation on, among other things, clinical, regulatory and commercial
information in respect of Oxbryta and the Company’s product candidates, GBT601 and inclacumab, as well as an
overview of the Company’s research programs.
On June 28, 2022, Dr. Love met virtually with a representative of Company A to discuss, among other things, the
mechanisms of action of the Company’s products and product candidates.
On June 29, 2022, representatives of Company A called Dr. Love and Ms. Choi to request that Company A be
permitted to conduct full due diligence, including being granted access to a virtual data room. In connection with
such request, Company A delivered a revised non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
equity of the Company for $60.00 per share of GBT common stock, which offer was subsequently delivered to the
Company in writing (which we refer to as the “June 29 Company A Proposal”), which proposal represented a 101%
premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $29.84 on June 28, 2022, the last trading day prior to
the June 29 Company A Proposal.
On July 5, 2022, the Transaction Committee, along with other members of the Board and management as well as
representatives of the Company’s financial advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to consider and discuss,
among other things, the June 29 Company A Proposal and the status of discussions with other potential acquirors.
Dr. Love provided the Transaction Committee with an overview of the discussions with Company A and the outreach
to other potential acquirors, including Pfizer and Company B, that had occurred since the prior Board meeting on
June 14, 2022. Representatives of the Company’s financial advisors also briefed the Transaction Committee on the
outreach efforts since the prior Board meeting and indicated that the other potential acquirors had declined to engage
in further discussions regarding a potential acquisition of the Company. Representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors presented certain preliminary financial analyses of the June 29 Company A Proposal. Following discussion,
the Transaction Committee determined that the Company would permit Company A to commence further due
diligence to enable it to further improve its offer price. The Transaction Committee and other participating Board
members directed the Company’s financial advisors to inform Company A that the June 29 Company A Proposal was
still insufficient from a financial perspective, but that the Company would grant Company A full diligence access to
the Company’s virtual data room in order to enable Company A to improve its offer price. Additionally, the
Transaction Committee directed the Company’s financial advisors to continue to seek offers from Pfizer and Company
B as a condition to such parties conducting further due diligence.
On July 6, 2022, Dr. Love and Ms. Choi met virtually with representatives of Company A. Dr. Love informed the
representatives of Company A that the June 29 Company A Proposal was insufficient from a financial perspective,
but that the Company would allow Company A to conduct further due diligence, with the expectation that Company
A would increase its offer price following its due diligence review. The next day, Company A was granted access to a
virtual data room established by the Company.
On July 6, 2022, representatives of Pfizer spoke telephonically with representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors to share a preliminary list of high-priority diligence questions in order to further assess Pfizer’s potential
interest in an acquisition of the Company. The next day, Dr. Love met virtually with several representatives of Pfizer to
discuss, among other things, certain of such diligence questions.
On July 11, 2022, representatives of Pfizer provided a letter to Dr. Love containing a non-binding proposal to acquire
100% of the Company’s equity for $53.00 per share of GBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the “July 11
Pfizer Proposal”), which proposal represented a 52% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of
$34.85 on July 8, 2022, the last trading day prior to the July 11 Pfizer Proposal. The offer letter stated that Pfizer’s
executive leadership strongly supported the proposal and proposed three weeks of due diligence to be conducted
concurrently with negotiation of a definitive merger agreement. The same day, the Company’s management provided
the Board with a copy of the offer letter from Pfizer, and Pfizer was granted access to the virtual data room in order to
enable Pfizer to improve its offer price.
On July 12, 2022, representatives of Company B provided a letter to representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors containing a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the Company’s equity for $50.50 per share of GBT
common stock in cash (which we refer to as the “July 12 Company B Proposal”), which proposal represented a 50%
premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.71 on July 11, 2022, the last trading day prior to
the July 12 Company B Proposal. The offer letter proposed six to eight weeks of due diligence upon access to the
Company’s management and the virtual data room, but, unlike Pfizer and Company A, did not indicate engagement by
Company B of financial or legal advisors.
On July 13, 2022, after consultation with management of the Company, representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors informed representatives of Company B that the July 12 Company B Proposal was insufficient both from a
financial perspective and regarding the time to completion of diligence and that Company B would need to submit a
revised offer with improved terms in order for the Company to grant Company B access to the virtual data room.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
During the following weeks, Pfizer and Company A conducted their respective due diligence investigations of the
Company. Representatives of the Company continued to meet virtually with representatives of Pfizer and Company A
to discuss certain diligence items.
On July 18, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Company A’s outside
counsel and to representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Pfizer’s legal counsel (which we refer to as
“Wachtell Lipton”). The initial draft included, among other things, a proposed termination fee, which would be
payable by the Company upon the occurrence of certain events, including the Company’s termination of the merger
agreement to accept a superior proposal (which we refer to as a “company termination fee”), of 1.50% of transaction
equity value.
On July 20, 2022, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors spoke telephonically with representatives of
Pfizer to discuss, among other things, Pfizer’s desire to execute a definitive agreement by early August and the status
of Pfizer’s due diligence process. During the conversation, the representative of Pfizer informed representatives of
the Company’s financial advisors that Pfizer would send a revised offer in the coming days.
On July 22, 2022, representatives of Company B provided a letter to representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors containing a revised non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the Company’s equity for $58.00 per share of
GBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the “July 22 Company B Proposal”), which proposal represented a
67% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $34.82 on July 21, 2022, the last trading day
prior to the July 22 Company B Proposal. The revised offer letter proposed three weeks of due diligence upon access
to the Company’s management and the virtual data room, and, consistent with its prior offer letter, did not indicate
engagement by Company B of financial or legal advisors.
Over the next two days, Company B was granted access to the virtual data room in order to enable Company B to
improve its offer price and representatives of Cravath sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Company B.
The terms of such draft merger agreement were identical to the terms of the draft merger agreements previously sent
to representatives of Company A’s outside counsel and to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. During the following
weeks, Company B conducted its due diligence investigation of the Company, although no external advisors were
involved in any of the interactions. Representatives of the Company continued to meet virtually with representatives
of Company B to discuss certain diligence items, however, its level of engagement was not comparable to that of
Pfizer or Company A.
On July 26, 2022, representatives of Pfizer provided a letter to Dr. Love containing a revised non-binding proposal to
acquire 100% of the Company’s equity for $60.00 in cash (which we refer to as the “July 26 Pfizer Proposal”), which
proposal represented a 79% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.52 on July 25, 2022,
the last trading day prior to the July 26 Pfizer Proposal. The revised letter provided that Pfizer’s due diligence review
was substantially complete, and noted that Pfizer was prepared to move expeditiously to sign a definitive merger
agreement and announce the transaction within a week.
Shortly after the submission of the letter, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent a revised draft merger agreement to
representatives of Cravath. The draft included, among other things, a proposed company termination fee of 4.00% of
transaction equity value.
On July 27, 2022, the Transaction Committee, along with each other member of the Board, members of management
and representatives of the Company’s financial advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to discuss, among other
topics, the progress of the proposed transaction to date, including the revised offer and revised draft merger
agreement from Pfizer and the status of the bids from Company A and Company B. Management of the Company and
representatives of the Company’s financial advisors reviewed with the Transaction Committee the Company’s
interactions with Pfizer, Company A and Company B since the prior Transaction Committee meeting on July 5, 2022.
The Transaction Committee then discussed with the Company’s management and representatives of the Company’s
financial advisors and Cravath the potential for the Company to obtain increased offers from each of the potential
acquirors, relative timelines and relative certainty of execution and closing with each of the potential acquirors, taking
into account each potential acquiror’s progress in the diligence and negotiation processes to date and timeline to
execution of a definitive agreement as well as regulatory considerations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on July 27, 2022, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors informed
representatives of Company A’s financial advisor that the Company was engaged in discussions with other potential
acquirors.
On July 28, 2022, representatives of Company A’s outside counsel sent a revised draft merger agreement to
representatives of Cravath. The draft included, among other things, a proposed company termination fee of 4.00% of
transaction equity value.
On July 30, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent revised draft merger agreements to representatives of Company A’s
outside counsel and to representatives of Wachtell Lipton. The drafts sent to both parties contained substantially
similar terms, and each draft included, among other things, a proposed company termination fee of 2.00% of
transaction equity value.
On July 31, 2022, after consultation with management of the Company, representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors sent a letter to representatives of each of Pfizer, Company A and Company B instructing each party to
submit a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Cravath by noon, Eastern Time, on August 2,
2022, following which representatives of Cravath would provide feedback to such party. The letter further instructed
each party to submit a final proposal, including a best and final offer price per share of GBT common stock and a
revised draft of the merger agreement in a form that such potential acquiror would be willing to execute, by noon,
Eastern Time, on August 5, 2022.
On August 2, 2022, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives of
Cravath. The draft included, among other things, a proposed company termination fee of 3.75% of transaction equity
value and a proposed reverse termination fee, which would be payable by Pfizer if certain specified antitrust-related
closing conditions were not met (which we refer to as a “reverse termination fee”), of 3.75% of transaction equity
value. Later that day, representatives of Wachtell Lipton also discussed with representatives of Cravath the proposed
terms, including commitments around regulatory approval and transaction structure. Also on August 2, 2022,
representatives of Company A’s outside counsel sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives of Cravath.
The draft included, among other things, a proposed company termination fee of 3.00% of transaction equity value.
Representatives of Company B did not submit a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Cravath
on August 2, 2022.
On August 3, 2022, Bloomberg News published an article online after market hours indicating that the Company was
attracting takeover interest from unidentified large pharmaceutical companies. On August 3, 2022, the last trading day
that closed prior to the publication of the Bloomberg News article, the closing price for shares of GBT common stock
was $33.93.
On August 3, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to discuss, among other topics, updated projections refined by the
Company’s management reflecting certain updates since June 14, 2022, as well as the status and terms of the draft
merger agreements. At the meeting, members of the Company’s management presented updated projections to the
Board (as described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “- Certain Financial Forecasts”). Following
discussion, the Board authorized such projections for use by the Board in evaluating the potential transaction with
Pfizer and by the Company’s financial advisors in their financial analyses in connection with the potential delivery of
their respective fairness opinions. Representatives of Cravath then provided an overview of relationships each of
Cravath and the Company’s financial advisors has with the potential acquirors. Representatives of Cravath next
reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with its consideration of the proposed transactions and the key
legal terms of the draft merger agreements proposed by each of Pfizer and Company A. Representatives of Cravath
reviewed with the Board the potential regulatory review process and timeline for a transaction with each of the
potential acquirors. Representatives of Cravath and members of the Board then discussed how certain terms of the
merger agreement, including certain regulatory provisions and the closing conditions, affect the likelihood of closing
of a potential transaction. Representatives of the Company’s financial advisors then discussed the status of
negotiations with representatives of Pfizer, Company A and Company B. In addition, disclosure regarding
relationships with the Company, Pfizer, Company A and Company B of the Company’s financial advisors was
reviewed with the Board and the Board approved the formal engagement terms for each of J.P. Morgan and
Centerview as the Company’s financial advisors in connection with its review of a potential transaction.

stock of $33.93 on August 3, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior to public market speculation regarding a
potential sale of the Company. The offer letter stated that Company A had completed due diligence and secured all
approvals (including approval from its board of directors) necessary to execute the merger agreement. The offer letter
indicated that the August 5 Company A Proposal was not subject to any financing requirements and that Company A
was prepared to execute a definitive merger agreement on or before August 7, 2022. The offer letter requested that, if
the Company elected to move forward with the August 5 Company A Proposal, the Company enter into a customary
exclusivity agreement providing for exclusive negotiations until 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on August 8, 2022. Following
Dr. Love’s discussion with representatives of Company A, representatives of Company A submitted a revised draft
merger agreement to representatives of the Company’s financial advisors, which draft included, among other things, a
proposed company termination fee of 2.75% of transaction equity value.
Later that morning, Dr. Albert Bourla, Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer, called Dr. Love to discuss Pfizer’s commitment
to SCD and to the community and indicated that Pfizer would shortly be delivering a revised proposal to the
Company. In the proposal which was subsequently delivered by representatives of Pfizer to the Company in writing,
Pfizer offered to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of the Company for $67.50 per share of GBT common stock
in cash (which we refer to as the “August 5 Pfizer Proposal”), which proposal represented a 99% premium to the
closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.93 on August 3, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior to
public market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company. The offer letter stated that Pfizer had completed
due diligence and secured all approvals (including approval from its board of directors) necessary to execute the
merger agreement. The offer letter indicated that the August 5 Pfizer Proposal was not subject to any financing
requirements and that Pfizer was prepared to execute a definitive merger agreement immediately. Subsequently,
representatives of Wachtell Lipton submitted a draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Cravath, which
draft included, among other things, the Company Termination Fee of $217 million (3.75% of transaction equity value)
and the Reverse Termination Fee of $326 million (5.625% of transaction equity value). Company B did not submit a
final offer or a draft merger agreement on August 5, 2022.
Later that morning, The Wall Street Journal published an article online indicating that Pfizer was in advanced
negotiations to acquire the Company for about $5 billion and that the Company was also negotiating with other
potential acquirors.
Later that same morning, in advance of the scheduled Board meeting at noon, Pacific Time, management and the
Company’s financial advisors provided feedback to representatives of both Pfizer and Company A. Dr. Love
contacted representatives of Company A and expressed that the August 5 Company A Proposal was insufficient from
a financial perspective. Representatives of Company A subsequently indicated to Dr. Love that Company A would be
willing to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of the Company for $65.00 per share of GBT common stock in cash
(which we refer to as the “Revised August 5 Company A Proposal”), which proposal represented a 92% premium to
the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.93 on August 3, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior
to public market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company. Following that subsequent discussion,
representatives of the Company’s financial advisors contacted representatives of Pfizer to inform them that the
Company had received a competing proposal from another party that was not that far apart in terms of value, and that
Pfizer should also consider improving the terms of its draft merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At noon, Pacific Time, on August 5, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of the
Company’s financial advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to discuss, among other topics, the August 5
Pfizer Proposal and the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal. First, Dr. Love provided the Board with an update on
his conversations with representatives of Pfizer and Company A earlier that day, and representatives of the
Company’s financial advisors updated the Board on their conversation with representatives of Pfizer. Next,
representatives of Cravath reviewed the merger agreements submitted by Pfizer and Company A with their respective
proposals. Representatives of Cravath compared the terms of the draft merger agreements submitted by Pfizer and
Company A, including the closing conditions and certain regulatory matters. The Board and representatives of
Cravath discussed the August 5 Pfizer Proposal and the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal, including that the
August 5 Pfizer Proposal included a higher price per share of GBT common stock than the Revised August 5
Company A Proposal, while the merger agreement submitted by Company A was generally more favorable to the
Company than the merger agreement submitted by Pfizer with respect to regulatory matters and the closing
conditions. Representatives of Cravath then reviewed with the Board certain employee retention, compensation and
benefits-related matters in the draft merger agreements submitted by Pfizer and Company A, including that the
Revised August 5 Company A Proposal contemplated that all Company PSUs would be cashed out at the maximum
level, while the August 5 Pfizer Proposal contemplated that Company PSUs based on patient share and total
stockholder return would be cashed out at the greater of target and actual performance (as of the closing of the
proposed transaction) and Company PSUs based on the price of GBT common stock would be canceled upon
consummation of the proposed transaction. Further, the Board was advised that Company B had not engaged in any
interactions with the Company’s management or advisors regarding price or contract terms since the last update to
the Board. Following such discussion, the Board directed the Company’s management, with the assistance of its
financial and legal advisors, to seek a revised offer from each of Pfizer and Company A.
After the noon Board meeting, Dr. Love contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to seek an increase in
Company A’s offer price. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A indicated that the $65.00 price per share of GBT
common stock contained in the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal was likely the highest price that Company A
was willing to pay to acquire the Company. In addition, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the
Company’s financial advisors separately contacted representatives of Pfizer and Company A to discuss each of their
proposals. During these discussions, representatives of Company A indicated to representatives of the Company’s
financial advisors that they were uncertain of their ability to increase their offer above the $65.00 price per share of
GBT common stock contained in the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal. Separately, representatives of Pfizer
indicated to representatives of the Company’s financial advisors that they were reiterating the $67.50 price per share
of GBT common stock in the August 5 Pfizer Proposal. Representatives of Cravath also contacted representatives of
Wachtell Lipton in order to discuss certain terms of the draft merger agreement that impacted closing certainty,
including the closing conditions.
At 4:00 p.m., Pacific Time, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of the Company’s
financial advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to discuss, among other topics, the outreach to
representatives of Pfizer and Company A since the Board meeting earlier that day. Dr. Love described to the Board his
discussion with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A. Additionally, representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors described to the Board their separate discussions with representatives of Pfizer and Company A.
Representatives of Cravath updated the Board on their discussions with representatives of Wachtell Lipton since the
prior meeting. The Board directed representatives of the Company’s financial advisors to solicit “best and final”
offers from each of Pfizer and Company A.
After the Board meeting, as directed by the Board, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors contacted
representatives of Pfizer and representatives of Company A in order to solicit “best and final” offers. Representatives
of Company A confirmed that the Revised August 5 Company A Proposal represented Company A’s “best and final”
offer. Representatives of Cravath also contacted representatives of Wachtell Lipton to seek improved merger
agreement terms, including with respect to the closing conditions.
At 8:00 p.m., Pacific Time, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of the Company’s
financial advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to discuss, among other topics, the outreach to
representatives of Pfizer and Company A since the prior Board meeting. Representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors reviewed with the Board their discussions with representatives of Pfizer and Company A since the Board
meeting earlier that day. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board the key terms of the
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
merger agreement submitted by Pfizer, including certain changes to the closing conditions that were favorable to the
Company to which Pfizer had agreed. The meeting was then temporarily adjourned in order for representatives of
Cravath to contact representatives of Wachtell Lipton to seek further clarification regarding Pfizer’s latest proposal
on the terms of the merger agreement for the Board to consider.
During the adjournment, and subsequent to discussions between representatives of Cravath and representatives of
Wachtell Lipton, at the direction of the Board, representatives of the Company’s financial advisors contacted
representatives of Pfizer to solicit its “best and final” offer price, based upon the contract terms Pfizer would be
willing to execute in a potential definitive merger agreement. Subsequent to this conversation, representatives of
Pfizer indicated to representatives of the Company’s financial advisors that, provided the Company was willing to
sign a definitive merger agreement substantially on the terms Pfizer had last presented, Pfizer would increase its offer
to $68.50 per share of GBT common stock in cash (which we refer to as the “Revised August 5 Pfizer Proposal”),
which represented a 102% premium to the closing price for shares of GBT common stock of $33.93 on August 3, 2022,
the last trading day that closed prior to public market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company.
Additionally, representatives of Pfizer indicated that Pfizer was prepared to execute the definitive merger agreement
by August 6, 2022.
Following those discussions, the Board meeting was reconvened. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the
Board the terms of the merger agreement proposed by representatives of Wachtell Lipton, including with respect to
the closing conditions. Representatives of the Company’s financial advisors then provided an update to the Board
on the Revised August 5 Pfizer Proposal. The Board then discussed the financial and contractual terms of the
Revised August 5 Company A Proposal and the Revised August 5 Pfizer Proposal. Following such discussion, the
Board directed the Company’s management, with the assistance of its legal advisors, to finalize the definitive merger
agreement with Pfizer at a price per share of GBT common stock of $68.50 and on the contractual terms included in the
Revised August 5 Pfizer Proposal (as updated based on conversations between representatives of Cravath and
Wachtell Lipton on August 5th) and authorized the Company’s management to discuss certain employee retention,
compensation and benefits-related matters with Pfizer.
After the Board meetings on August 5th and through August 7, 2022, representatives of the Company, Pfizer, Cravath
and Wachtell Lipton discussed and exchanged comments to the draft merger agreement. At the conclusion of these
discussions, the parties had agreed on the final form of merger agreement. On August 6, 2022, Dr. Love had
conversations with representatives of Pfizer regarding certain employee retention, compensation and benefits-related
matters; these conversations did not result in revisions to the Revised August 5 Pfizer Proposal.
On August 7, 2022, the Board, along with members of management and representatives of the Company’s financial
advisors, Cravath and Goodwin, met virtually to review the proposed transaction with Pfizer. Dr. Love described to
the Board his discussions with representatives of Pfizer since the last Board meeting. Representatives of J.P. Morgan
reviewed its financial analysis of the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock, and rendered
to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 7,
2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the
Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock to be paid to GBT stockholders (other than as
specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Representatives of Centerview reviewed its financial analysis of the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT
common stock, and rendered to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated August 7, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by
Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock to be paid to
GBT stockholders (other than Excluded Shares (as defined therein)) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from
a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of J.P. Morgan’s opinion and Centerview’s
opinion, please see the sections of this proxy statement below entitled “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan” and “-Opinion of
Centerview”, respectively. The written opinions delivered by J.P. Morgan and Centerview are attached to this Proxy
Statement as Annex B and Annex C, respectively. Representatives of Cravath reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties in
connection with its consideration of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board
the terms of the proposed merger agreement, including the terms of the “no shop” provisions and interim operating
34
TABLE OF CONTENTS
covenants. Following additional discussion and consideration of the proposed merger agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the proposed merger agreement, the Board recessed and the Compensation
Committee of the Board convened and unanimously approved certain employment compensation and other employee
benefit arrangements with respect to the employees of the Company in connection with the proposed merger
agreement, including the treatment of Company equity awards. Following such approval by the Compensation
Committee of the Board, the Board reconvened and unanimously (i) approved the Merger Agreement and declared
that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) authorized and approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of
the Company’s stockholders at a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders and (iv) resolved to recommend that
the Company’s stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger.
Following the conclusion of the Board meeting, the parties executed and delivered the Merger Agreement on August
7, 2022.
On August 8, 2022, prior to the opening of trading on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, the parties
issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.

Recommendation of the Board
The Board has unanimously: (a) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, GBT and its stockholders; (b) approved
the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, including the execution,
delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger; (c) resolved to recommend that GBT stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement; and
(d) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by GBT stockholders at the
Special Meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR”
the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
As described above in the section entitled “-Background of the Merger”, prior to and in reaching its unanimous
determination to authorize and approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger advisable and in the best interests of the Company and stockholders
of the Company and recommend that the Company’s stockholders approve the Merger, the Board consulted with and
received the advice of its financial advisors and outside counsel, discussed certain issues with the Company’s
management and considered a variety of factors weighing positively in favor of the Merger, the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, among other things, the following non-exhaustive list of
material factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
•
Merger Consideration; Premium to the Trading Price of GBT Common Stock. The Board considered the
current and historical market prices of GBT common stock, including the market performance of GBT
common stock relative to those of other participants in the Company’s industry and general market indices,
and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock represented a:
•
102% premium to the unaffected trading price at which GBT common stock closed on August 3, 2022,
the last trading day that closed prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the
Company;
•
110% premium to the volume weighted average price for GBT common stock over the 30-trading day
period ended August 3, 2022, the last trading day that closed prior to published market speculation
regarding a potential sale of the Company; and
35TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
70% premium to the highest closing price in the 52-week period ended August 3, 2022, the last trading
day that closed prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company.
•
Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration is
all cash, which will provide GBT stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of
GBT common stock, enables GBT stockholders to realize value that has been created by GBT and does not
expose them to any future risks related to the business or macroeconomic conditions (including the
COVID-19 pandemic), as compared to GBT remaining independent (especially when viewed against the
potential risks and uncertainties inherent in GBT’s business, including risks related to obtaining marketing
approvals for products and the timing of regulatory approval and launch, success of clinical testing,
labeling, pricing and market acceptance of product candidates).
•
No Financing Condition. The Board considered the fact that Pfizer and Merger Sub would have sufficient
cash resources to pay the amounts required to be paid under the Merger Agreement and that the Merger is
not subject to a financing condition.
•
Sale Process. The Board considered the fact that it had engaged in extensive discussions regarding
strategic options and potential acquirors with the Company’s management and representatives of the
Company’s financial advisors. In particular, the process conducted by the Board, with the assistance of the
Company’s financial advisors, involved contacting, or responding to, six potential acquirors, entering into
non-disclosure agreements with and providing management presentations and granting due diligence
access to three potential acquirors, receiving non-binding offers from three potential acquirors and
receiving two final proposals, one of which was from Pfizer. The Board also considered the fact that the
media coverage regarding GBT’s discussions with potentially interested parties did not result in any
outreach or proposals from any new potential acquirors. For a detailed discussion of the sale process,
please see above under the heading entitled “-Background of the Merger”.
•
The Company’s Operating and Financial Condition and Prospects. The Board considered the
Company’s operating and financial performance and its prospects, including certain prospective forecasts
for the Company prepared by the Company’s senior management, which reflect an application of various
assumptions of senior management. The Board considered the inherent uncertainty of achieving senior
management’s prospective forecasts, as set forth under the heading entitled “-Certain Financial
Forecasts”, and that as a result the Company’s actual financial results in future periods could differ
materially from senior management’s forecasts.
•
Best Strategic Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. After a thorough review of strategic
alternatives and discussions with management and the Company’s financial and legal advisors, the Board
determined that the Merger Consideration is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the
potential value that might result from other strategic options available, including, but not limited to,
remaining a standalone public company. The Board also carefully evaluated, with the assistance of legal
and financial advisors and members of management, the risks and potential benefits associated with other
strategic or financial alternatives and the potential for shareholder value creation associated with those
alternatives. As part of these evaluations, the Board considered:
•
an assessment of the Company’s business, assets (including commercial-stage and pipeline assets),
prospects, competitive position, regulatory landscape, historical and projected financial performance,
short- and long-term capital needs and the nature of the industries in which the Company competes;
and
•
the risks associated with the Company’s business and remaining a standalone public company,
including (i) the results of the Company’s commercialization of Oxbryta, (ii) obtaining marketing
approvals for Oxbryta in additional indications or in additional jurisdictions and (iii) the timing of
regulatory approval and launch, success of clinical testing, labeling, pricing and market acceptance of
the Company’s product candidates.
•
J.P. Morgan’s and Centerview’s Respective Fairness Opinions and Related Financial Analyses. The
Board considered (i) the oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the Board on August 7, 2022, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 7, 2022, that, as of such
36
TABLE OF CONTENTS
date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in connection with its opinion, the
Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock to be paid to GBT stockholders (other
than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders and (ii) the oral opinion of Centerview rendered to the Board on August 7, 2022,
which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 7, 2022, that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its
opinion, the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share of GBT common stock to be paid to GBT
stockholders (other than Excluded Shares (as defined in such opinion)) pursuant to the Merger Agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of J.P. Morgan’s opinion
and Centerview’s opinion, please see below in “-Opinion of J.P. Morgan” and “-Opinion of Centerview”.
The written opinions delivered by J.P. Morgan and Centerview are attached to this proxy statement as
Annex B and Annex C, respectively.
•
Negotiation Process. The Board considered its belief that, after extensive negotiations, the Company
obtained the highest price that Pfizer is willing to pay for the Company, as evidenced by the Company’s
ability to increase the Merger Consideration relative to Pfizer’s initial offer of $53.00 per share of GBT
common stock. The Board considered the fact that the terms of the Merger were the result of robust arm’s-
length negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge of and at the direction of the Board,
with the assistance of experienced financial and legal advisors and in the context of a competitive process.
For a detailed discussion of the negotiation process, please see above under the heading entitled “-
Background of the Merger”.
•
Timing of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Merger
and concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The
Board also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the
period during which GBT’s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related
disruption.
•
Product Development, Commercialization and Regulatory Risks. The Board considered the risks
inherent in the research, development, regulatory review and potential future commercialization of the
Company’s product candidates, and the risks related to market acceptance of such product candidates, if
approved, and other factors potentially impacting the revenues and profitability of biotechnology and
pharmaceutical products generally. The Board also considered the uncertainty associated with market
demand, pricing, governmental reimbursement and other factors beyond the control of the Company with
respect to Oxbryta and the Company’s product candidates in the Company’s pipeline.
•
Business Reputation of Pfizer. The Board considered the business reputation and capabilities of Pfizer and
its management and the substantial financial resources of Pfizer, which the Board believed supported the
conclusion that a transaction with Pfizer could be completed relatively quickly and in an orderly manner.
The Board also considered Pfizer’s expertise in rare hematology and Pfizer’s logistical and financial abilities
to build on the parties’ shared commitment to and engagement with the SCD community.
•
Existing Resources. The Board considered the fact that the Company may require additional capital in
order to complete the remaining clinical development for its product candidates and to potentially
commercialize these product candidates, as well as fund its other ongoing operations. The Board also took
into consideration that, while the Company may seek additional funding through future debt and equity
financing or additional collaborations or strategic partnerships, any such fundraising could be dilutive to
the Company’s existing stockholders, might be available only on unfavorable terms or might not be
available at all.
•
No Vote of Pfizer Stockholders. The Board considered the fact that the Merger is not subject to the
conditionality and execution risk of any required approval by Pfizer’s stockholders.
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, including:
•
that the Company may, subject to certain conditions, furnish, pursuant to entry into an acceptable
confidentiality agreement, confidential information with respect to the Company to third parties
making an unsolicited proposal and participate in discussions or negotiations with such third parties
regarding unsolicited proposals that are made prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger;
•
the provision allowing the Board to change its recommendation that the Company’s stockholders
approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger
in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Company Proposal or Intervening Event, subject to
Pfizer’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment of the termination fee of $217
million;
•
the provision allowing the Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Company
Proposal, subject to certain conditions (including payment of the termination fee of $217 million and
certain rights of Pfizer to match the Superior Company Proposal);
•
the Board’s belief, after discussion with GBT’s advisors, that the $217 million Company Termination
Fee, which constitutes approximately 3.75% of GBT’s equity value in the Merger, would not preclude a
Superior Company Proposal from being made; and
•
the Reverse Termination Fee of $326 million that may be owed by Pfizer to the Company in connection
with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified antitrust related circumstances.
For a detailed discussion of the Merger Agreement, please see below under the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement”.
•
Appraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Company
stockholders who comply with all of the required procedures for perfecting appraisal rights under the DGCL
in connection with the Merger, including the fact that such stockholders will have the right to demand
appraisal and payment of the fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
For a detailed discussion of appraisal rights, please see below under the section entitled “-Appraisal
Rights”.
•
Specific Performance. GBT’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek
specific performance of Pfizer’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent
other breaches of the Merger Agreement.
•
Opportunity for GBT Stockholders to Vote. The Board considered the fact that the Merger would be
subject to the approval of GBT stockholders, and GBT stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger
and vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related
to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the following material factors:
•
No Participation in GBT’s Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered that if the Merger is
consummated, stockholders of the Company will receive the Merger Consideration in cash and will no
longer have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the Company or the
combined company or benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of GBT common stock,
including any value that could be achieved if the Company engages in future strategic or other
transactions and/or is successful in commercializing any of its product candidates.
•
Closing Conditions. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to
the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is
adopted by GBT stockholders.
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Disruption of the Company’s Business. The Board considered the effect of a public announcement of the
Merger on the Company’s operations, stock price and employees and its ability to attract and retain
management, sales and other personnel while the Merger is pending and the potential adverse effects on
the financial and other results of the Company as a result of that disruption.
•
Non-Solicitation Covenant. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the
Company’s solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties and requires the Company to provide
Pfizer with an opportunity to propose adjustments to the Merger Agreement prior to the Company being
able to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Company Proposal, although the Board
believes this would not preclude another potential acquiror from submitting a proposal to acquire the
Company.
•
Company Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that the Company must pay Pfizer the Company
Termination Fee of $217 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances,
including to accept a Superior Company Proposal, and that the amount of the Company Termination Fee is
comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, is reasonable, would not likely deter
competing bids and would not likely be required to be paid unless the Company entered into a more
favorable transaction. The Board also recognized that the provisions in the Merger Agreement relating to
these fees were insisted upon by Pfizer as a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement.
•
Interim Operating Covenants. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on
the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, requiring the Company
to conduct its and its subsidiaries’ business in the ordinary course of business, which may delay or
prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the
Merger (as more fully described under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Conduct of Business
Pending the Merger”).
•
Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the
Merger might not be consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:
•
GBT’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort
and will have experienced significant distraction from their work during the pendency of the Merger;
•
GBT will have incurred significant transaction costs;
•
GBT’s continuing business relationships with personnel, third-party payors, customers, suppliers and
other business parties may be adversely affected;
•
the trading price of shares of GBT common stock could be materially and adversely affected;
•
the market’s perceptions of GBT’s prospects could be adversely affected; and
•
GBT could lose management or other personnel of GBT during the pendency of the Merger.
•
Regulatory Matters. The Board considered the regulatory approvals that would be required to
consummate the Merger and the prospects for receiving such approvals. The Board considered the fact
that (i) the parties would be required to use their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy the closing
conditions relating to certain regulatory matters, including the expiration or termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, as well as the receipt of certain non-U.S. antitrust approvals, and (ii) Pfizer
would not be required to agree to, among other things, (A) sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold
separate any assets or businesses of the Company, Pfizer or any of their respective subsidiaries or (B)
accept any operational restrictions on with respect to any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights,
operations or businesses of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. For a detailed discussion of regulatory
matters, please see below under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement-Other Covenants-Efforts to
Consummate the Merger”.
•
Potential Future Share Price. The possibility that, although the Merger provides the Company’s
stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium to the price at which GBT common stock traded prior to
the public announcement of the Merger, the price of GBT common stock might have increased in the future
to a price greater than the Merger Consideration.
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Timing Risks. The Board considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including
that completion of the Merger depends on factors outside of GBT’s or Pfizer’s control (including the
approval of the Merger by GBT stockholders and certain governmental authorities), and the risk that the
pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the execution of the
Merger Agreement could divert GBT management’s attention and have an adverse impact on GBT,
including its client and other business relationships.
•
Litigation Risk. The Board considered the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.
•
Tax Treatment. The Board considered that the receipt of the Merger Consideration payable in the Merger
will generally be taxable to stockholders of the Company for United States federal income tax purposes. The
Board believed that this was mitigated by the fact that the entire consideration payable in the Merger
would be cash, providing adequate cash for the payment of any taxes due.
•
Other Risks. The Board considered various other risks associated with the Merger and the business of the
Company, as more fully described below in the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements”.
The Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger were
outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.
In addition to considering the factors described above, the Board also considered that some of GBT’s directors and
executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of GBT stockholders
generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them at the time it approved the Merger Agreement
and made its recommendation to GBT stockholders. For more information, please see the section of this proxy
statement entitled “-Interests of GBT’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”. The foregoing discussion of
the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material
positive and negative factors considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did
not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and
recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board
did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular
aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its unanimous
recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. This explanation
of the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and
should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.

"Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc._20220829_DEFM14A_20311227_4510555.Pdf",Opinion of J.P. Morgan,"Opinion of J.P. Morgan
Pursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as one of its financial advisors in connection
with the proposed Merger.
At the meeting of the Board on August 7, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Board that, as of such
date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Merger Consideration to
be paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. J.P.
Morgan has confirmed its August 7, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Board, dated August 7,
2022, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated August 7, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. GBT stockholders are urged to read
the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in
connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the Merger
Consideration to be paid in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no
opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other
40TABLE OF CONTENTS
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the
Company to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness
committee of J.P. Morgan. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
GBT stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the
industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such
companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of the GBT common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management
of the Company relating to its business, which are referred to in this summary of J.P. Morgan’s opinion as
the “Management Forecasts”, and are described further in the section of this proxy statement below
entitled “-Certain Financial Forecasts” beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition
and future prospects and operations of the Company and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or
appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for
J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness (and
did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification). J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was
not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of
the Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying
on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they
were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by
management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such
analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on
which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the
representations and warranties made by the Company and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related
agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal,
regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues.
J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for
the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated
benefits of the Merger.
The Management Projections were prepared by the Company’s management. The Company does not publicly
disclose internal management projections of the type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan’s
analysis of the proposed Merger, and such projections were not prepared with a view toward public
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
disclosure. These projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and
may be beyond the control of the Company’s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general
economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary
significantly from those set forth in such projections. For more information regarding the use of projections and other
forward-looking statements, please refer to the section of this proxy statement below entitled “-Certain Financial
Forecasts”.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that
subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed
no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company or the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P.
Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or
employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the Merger Consideration in
the proposed Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were determined through arm’s length
negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that
of the Board. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the
Board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Board
or management with respect to the proposed Merger or the Merger Consideration.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodology in rendering its opinion to the Board on August 7, 2022 and contained in the presentation delivered to
the Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The summary below does not purport to be
a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to
more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text
of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the
Company with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged
to be analogous to the Company. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:
Selected Companies
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Crispr Therapeutics AG
Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.
INSMED Inc.
Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc.
ChemoCentryx, Inc.
Editas Medicine, Inc.
Reata Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Median FV/2026E Revenue Multiple = 3.5x
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations
and business that, for the purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, J.P. Morgan considered to be similar to those of the
Company. However, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
from those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect
the selected companies differently than they would affect the Company.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated the multiple of the firm value (“FV”) for the Company and
the selected companies (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable net debt or net cash) to the analyst
consensus estimates for calendar year 2026 revenues for the applicable company (the “FV/2026E Revenue Multiple”).
Based on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/2026E Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of
1.1x to 5.2x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company’s projected revenue for the calendar year
2026 provided in the Management Forecasts. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the
GBT common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of approximately $21.25 to $88.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to
the implied per share equity value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders of $68.50.
Selected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions with
respect to businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be similar to the Company’s business (or aspects thereof) based
on J.P. Morgan’s experience and familiarity with the industries in which the Company operates. The following
transactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as relevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger:
Announcement Date
Target
Acquiror
January 19, 2022
Zogenix, Inc.
UCB S.A.
September 8. 2021
Kadmon Holdings, Inc.
Sanofi
February 1, 2021
Viela Bio, Inc.
Horizon Therapeutics plc
August 31, 2020
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.
Nestlé S.A.
May 5, 2020
Portola Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
September 30, 2019
Dova Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB
September 12, 2016
Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp.
Horizon Therapeutics plc
July 21, 2016
Relypsa Inc.
Galenica Pharmaceuticals Inc.
March 30, 2015
Hyperion Therapeutics Inc.
Horizon Therapeutics plc
Median FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple = 3.5x
None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. However, the selected transactions
were chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered
similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect
the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of the target
company’s FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company’s estimated forward revenue for the fourth
year following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the “FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple”).
Based on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/4-Year Forward Revenue Multiple reference range for the
Company of 2.6x to 5.4x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company’s projected revenue for the
twelve-month period ending September 30, 2026, $1.2 billion, which amount was provided by the management of the
Company. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for the GBT common stock (rounded to
the nearest $0.25) of approximately $44.25 to $83.75, which J.P. Morgan compared to the implied per share equity value
of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of
determining the fully diluted equity value per share for the GBT common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered
free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate from October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2042, including
the impact of certain net operating losses based upon the Management Forecasts. J.P. Morgan also calculated a
range of terminal values of the Company at the end of this period by applying perpetual growth rates ranging from
(50.0%) to (30.0%) for Oxbryta, GBT601 and inclacumab, 5.0% for research assets and 2.0%
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
for corporate overhead and other unallocated expenses based on guidance provided by the Company’s management,
to estimates of the unlevered free cash flow of the Company during calendar year 2042 as set forth in the
Management Forecasts. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to
present values as of September 30, 2022 using a range of discount rates from 10.5% to 13.5%, which were chosen by
J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the
unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by adding net cash as of
September 30, 2022, $351 million, which estimate was provided by the management of the Company. This analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values for the Company, which J.P. Morgan divided by the number of outstanding
shares of GBT common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis and adjusted for the Company’s assumed future
equity raise of $200 million in gross proceeds in 2023, to derive a range of implied per share equity value for the GBT
common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of approximately $52.25 and $65.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to the
implied per share equity value of the Merger Consideration to be paid to GBT stockholders of $68.50.
Certain Other Information. J.P. Morgan also reviewed the Company’s 52 week historical trading and analyst price
targets, in each case as of August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the date on which the trading price of GBT
common stock was perceived by J.P. Morgan to be affected by a potential transaction) which ranged from $22.30 to
$40.26 and $31.00 to $102.00, respectively. J.P. Morgan noted that historical stock trading and analyst price targets
analyses are not valuation methodologies but were presented merely for informational purposes.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the
foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of
the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for
analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the
Company. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those
analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses
or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or
negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the
totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or
events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P.
Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or
otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected
companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the selected
transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are
publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be
considered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their
participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger.
The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to
the Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company with respect to the
Merger and deliver an opinion to the Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such
experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company
and the industries in which it operates.
44
TABLE OF CONTENTS
For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger (including the delivery of its opinion), the
Company will pay J.P. Morgan an aggregate fee of, approximately, $53,200,000, of which $2,000,000 became payable
upon public announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement with respect to a Merger and the remainder of
which is payable upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P.
Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s engagement. During the two
years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other material
financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company. During the
two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or
investment banking relationships with Parent, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary
compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on
Parent’s credit facility in November 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on Parent’s offering of debt securities in August
2021. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit
facilities of Parent, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. During the two-year
period preceding delivery of its opinion on August 7, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Parent
were approximately $14 million. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of
the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and Parent. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P.
Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or Parent for their own accounts or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial
instruments.

45TABLE OF CONTENTS
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Centerview
reviewed, among other things:
•
an execution version of the Merger Agreement, dated August 7, 2022, referred to in this summary of
Centerview’s opinion as the “Draft Merger Agreement”;
•
Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020
and December 31, 2019;
•
certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company;
•
certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company;
•
certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; and
•
certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and
prospects of the Company, including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to the
Company prepared by management of the Company and furnished to Centerview by the Company for
purposes of Centerview’s analysis, which are referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the
“Management Forecasts”, and are described further below under the section of this proxy statement
entitled “-Certain Financial Forecasts”, and which are collectively referred to in this summary of
Centerview’s opinion as the “Internal Data”. For more information regarding the use of projections and
other forward-looking statements, please refer to the section of this proxy statement below entitled “-
Certain Financial Forecasts”.
Centerview also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of the
Company regarding their assessment of the Internal Data. In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available
financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for the Company and compared that data with similar
data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that Centerview
deemed relevant. Centerview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Centerview deemed relevant, and
conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as Centerview
deemed appropriate.
Centerview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness
of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with or reviewed by
Centerview for purposes of its opinion and, with the Company’s consent, Centerview relied upon such information as
being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview assumed, at the Company’s direction, that the Internal Data
(including, without limitation, the Management Forecasts) were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby
and Centerview relied, at the Company’s direction, on the Internal Data for purposes of Centerview’s analysis and
opinion. Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to the Internal Data or the assumptions on which it was based.
In addition, at the Company’s direction, Centerview did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of
the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company, nor was Centerview
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and was not asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical
inspection of the properties or assets of the Company. Centerview assumed, at the Company’s direction, that the final
executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any respect material to Centerview’s analysis or opinion from the
Draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Centerview. Centerview also assumed, at the Company’s direction, that the
Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with all
applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or
amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or
Centerview’s opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other
approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction, condition or other
change will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion.
Centerview did not evaluate and did not express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of the Company, or the
ability of the Company to

business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage.
Centerview’s opinion was limited to and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of
Centerview’s written opinion, to the holders of shares of GBT common stock (other than Excluded Shares) of the

of the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into
in connection with or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of the
Transaction or any other term or aspect of the Transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection
therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other

fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable
to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any party, or class of such persons in connection

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Board in connection
with Centerview’s opinion, dated August 7, 2022. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete
description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of, Centerview,
nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those
financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized
below should not be taken to be Centerview’s view of the actual value of the Company. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses set forth below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the
tables below without considering all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses
or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses or factors, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview’s financial analyses and its opinion. In
performing its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company or any
other parties to the Transaction. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or Centerview or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in
these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of the Company
do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the Company
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
may actually be sold. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial
analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative
information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 5,
2022 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Transaction) and is not necessarily indicative of
current market conditions.
Selected Public Company Analysis.
Centerview reviewed certain financial information of the Company and compared it to corresponding financial
information of certain publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies that Centerview selected based on its experience
and professional judgment (which companies are referred to as the “selected companies” in this summary of
Centerview’s opinion). Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, the
companies listed below were chosen by Centerview because, among other reasons, they are publicly traded
biopharmaceutical companies with certain business, operational and/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of
Centerview’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company.
However, because each of the selected companies has business, operational and/or financial characteristics that
differ significantly from those of the Company, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did
not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also
made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the
business, operational and/or financial characteristics of the Company and the selected companies that could affect
the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative
analysis.
Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of August 5, 2022,
Centerview calculated, for each selected company, such company’s enterprise value (calculated as the equity value
(determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-money options, warrants,
restricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities) plus the book value of debt less cash
and cash equivalents as a multiple of Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated revenue for calendar year
2026 (“EV/2026E Revenue Trading Multiple”).
The selected companies are summarized below:
Selected Company
Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.
BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Insmed Incorporated
Median EV/2026E Revenue Trading Multiple = 3.6x
Based on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment and
experience, Centerview selected a reference range of EV/2026E Revenue Trading Multiples of 2.00x to 4.25x to apply
to the Company’s estimated calendar year risk-adjusted 2026 net revenue as set forth in the Management Forecasts
and to Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated net revenue for the Company for calendar year 2026. In
selecting these ranges of EV/2026E Revenue Trading Multiples, Centerview made qualitative judgments based on its
experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, operational and/or financial
characteristics of the Company and the selected companies that could affect their public trading values in order to
provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis. Applying this range of EV/2026E
Revenue Trading Multiples to the Company’s estimated calendar year risk-adjusted 2026 net revenue as set forth in
the Management Forecasts of $1.293 billion under the Management Forecasts, and to Wall Street research analyst
consensus estimated net revenue for the Company for calendar year 2026 of $912 million, and adding to such
amounts the Company’s estimated net cash as of September 30, 2022 provided by the Company management as set
forth in the Internal Data, and dividing the results of the foregoing calculations by the number of fully diluted
outstanding shares of GBT common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account
outstanding in-the-money options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and shares issuable upon
conversion of the Convertible Notes (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Capped Call Transactions”), if
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
applicable), based on information provided by the Company management as of August 4, 2022 as set forth in the
Internal Data. For the purposes of Centerview’s analysis, net cash and fully diluted outstanding shares of GBT
common stock varied depending on whether the Convertible Notes were deemed to be in-the-money (at implied
equity values per share above $31.75) or out-of-the-money (at implied equity values per share at or below $31.75).
This analysis resulted in an implied per share equity value range for shares of GBT common stock of approximately
$35.85 to $71.65 and $25.45 to $52.90, respectively, rounded to the nearest $0.05. Centerview then compared these
ranges to the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share to be paid to the holders of shares of GBT common stock
(other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis.
Centerview reviewed and analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions involving
biopharmaceutical companies (which transactions are referred to as the “selected transactions” in this summary of
Centerview’s opinion) that Centerview, based on its experience and professional judgment, deemed relevant to
consider in relation to the Company and the Transaction. Although none of the selected transactions is directly
comparable to the Transaction, these transactions were selected, among other reasons, because they have certain
business, operational and/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, may be considered
similar to the Transaction. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent
transactions analyzed were diverse and there are inherent differences in the business, operational and/or financial
conditions and prospects of the Company and the companies included in the selected precedent transactions
analysis. This analysis involved complex considerations and qualitative judgments concerning differences in
business, operational and/or financial characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading,
acquisition or other values of the target companies in the selected transactions and the Company.
Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of the time of the
announcement of the selected transactions, Centerview calculated, for each selected transaction, the transaction
value (calculated as the offer value (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding
in-the-money options, warrants, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other convertible securities), plus
the book value of debt and certain liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and excluding any contingent
consideration) implied for each target company based on the consideration payable in the applicable selected
transaction) as a multiple of the target company’s Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated four-year forward
net revenue at the time of the transaction announcement (“Four-Year Forward Revenue Multiple”).
The selected transactions considered in this analysis are summarized below:

Based on this analysis and other considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its experience and professional
judgment, related to, among other things, differences in the business, operational and/or financial conditions and
prospects of the Company and the companies included in the selected precedent transactions analysis, Centerview
selected a reference range of Four-Year Forward Revenue Multiples of 3.00x to 4.50x derived from the selected
precedent transactions. Centerview applied this reference range of Four-Year Forward Revenue Multiples to Wall
Street research analyst consensus estimated four-year forward net revenue of $874 million, and added to it the
Company’s estimated net cash as of September 30, 2022, adjusted for an estimated $77 million in change of control
payments and prepayment penalties under the Company’s outstanding

TABLE OF CONTENTS
term loan payable in connection with the Transaction, provided by the Company management as set forth in the
Internal Data, and divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the Company’s fully diluted outstanding shares
of GBT common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into account outstanding in-the-
money options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and shares issuable upon conversion of the
Convertible Notes, including additional shares of GBT common stock issued as a result of the make-whole with
respect to the Convertible Notes, if applicable) based on information provided by the Company management as of
August 4, 2022 as set forth in the Internal Data. For the purposes of Centerview’s analysis, net cash and fully diluted
shares varied depending on whether the Convertible Notes were deemed to be in-the-money (at implied equity values
per share above $31.75) or out-of-the-money (at implied equity values per share at or below $31.75). This analysis
resulted in an implied per share equity value range for shares of GBT common stock of approximately $34.55 to $50.35,
rounded to the nearest $0.05. Centerview then compared this range to the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share
to be paid to the holders of shares of GBT common stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based on the Internal Data. A discounted
cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset or set of assets by
calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of the asset or set of assets. “Present value” refers to
the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts
by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of
capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.
In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of equity values for shares of GBT common stock by (a)
discounting to present value as of September 30, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.5% (reflecting
Centerview’s analysis of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital) and using a mid-year convention: (i) the
forecasted risk-adjusted, after-tax unlevered free cash flows of the Company over the period beginning on October 1,
2022 and ending on December 31, 2042, utilized by Centerview based on the Management Forecasts, (ii) an implied
terminal value of the Company, calculated by Centerview by assuming that unlevered free cash flows would decline
in perpetuity after December 31, 2042 (with the exception of cash flows associated with research assets and corporate
overhead and other unallocated expenses), based on guidance provided by the Company management, and (iii) tax
savings from usage of the Company’s federal net operating losses of $1.081 billion as of September 30, 2022 and the
Company’s future losses and (b) adding to the foregoing results the Company’s estimated net cash as of September
30, 2022, $351 million (adjusted for the conversion of the Convertible Notes, if applicable), which amount was
provided by the Company management as set forth in the Internal Data, and an assumed equity raise of $200 million
in 2023 as set forth in the Internal Data. Centerview divided the result of the foregoing calculations by the Company’s
fully diluted outstanding shares of GBT common stock (determined using the treasury stock method and taking into
account outstanding in-the-money options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and shares issuable upon
conversion of the Convertible Notes, if applicable), based on information provided by the Company management as
of August 4, 2022 as set forth in the Internal Data. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values per share
of GBT common stock of $56.35 to $65.25, rounded to the nearest $0.05. Centerview then compared this range to the
Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share to be paid to the holders of shares of GBT common stock (other than
Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Other Factors
Centerview noted for the Board certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including, among other
things, the following:
•
Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis. Centerview reviewed historical closing trading prices of shares of
GBT common stock during the 52-week period ended August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the date
on which the trading price of GBT common stock was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential
transaction), which reflected low and high stock closing prices for the Company during such period of
$22.30 to $40.26 per share of GBT common stock, and the closing trading price of shares of GBT common
stock on August 5, 2022 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Transaction) of $63.84
per share of GBT common stock.
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Analyst Price Targets Analysis. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for shares of GBT common stock
in publicly available Wall Street research analyst reports as of August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to
the date on which the trading price of GBT common stock was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a
potential transaction) which indicated low and high stock price targets for the Company ranging from
$31.00 to $102.00, and a median of $65.00, per share of GBT common stock.
•
Precedent Premiums Paid Analysis. Centerview performed an analysis of premiums paid in the selected
transactions involving publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies, as set forth above in “Selected
Precedent Transaction Analysis”. The premiums in this analysis were calculated by comparing the per
share acquisition price in each transaction to the closing price of the target company’s common stock for
the date one day prior to the date on which the trading price of the target’s common stock was perceived
by Centerview to be affected by a potential transaction. Based on the analysis above and other
considerations that Centerview deemed relevant in its professional judgment, Centerview applied a range of
50% to 100% to the Company’s closing stock price on August 3, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the date
on which the trading price of GBT common stock was perceived by Centerview to be affected by a potential
transaction) of $33.93, which resulted in an implied price range of approximately $50.90 to $67.85 per share
of GBT common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05.
General
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Centerview did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it
considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.
Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in
its evaluation of the Transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative
of the views of the Board or management of the Company with respect to the Merger Consideration or as to whether
the Board would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the
Transaction was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was approved
by the Board. Centerview provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Centerview did not, however
recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific amount of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Transaction.
Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment
banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion,
except for Centerview’s current engagement, Centerview has not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other
services to the Company, and Centerview has not received any compensation from the Company during such period.
In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion, Centerview was engaged to provide financial advisory
services unrelated to the Merger to Parent, including in connection with Parent’s acquisition of Arena
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2022 and certain other strategic matters. Centerview received between $20 million and $30
million in aggregate compensation from Parent for work performed during such period. Centerview may provide
financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company or Parent or their respective affiliates in the
future, for which Centerview may receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview’s and its affiliates’ directors,
officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview’s affiliates or related
investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial
interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.
The Board selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction based on Centerview’s
knowledge of the biopharmaceutical industry. Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Transaction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In connection with Centerview’s services as a financial advisor to the Board, the Company has agreed to pay
Centerview an aggregate fee of approximately $42 million, $2 million of which was payable upon the rendering of
Centerview’s opinion and $40 million of which is payable contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. In
addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview’s expenses arising, and to indemnify
Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview’s engagement.
Capped Call Transactions",55,62
"Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc._20220829_DEFM14A_20311227_4510555.Pdf",Capped Call Transactions,"Capped Call Transactions
On December 14, 2021, in connection with the pricing of GBT’s 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (which we
refer to as the “Convertible Notes”), GBT entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (which we refer
to as the “Base Capped Call Transactions”) with each of Jefferies International Limited, Mizuho Securities USA, LLC,
as agent for Mizuho Markets Americas LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as agent for Royal Bank of Canada, and
Wells Fargo Bank National Association (which we refer to as the “Capped Call Counterparties”). On December 15,
2021, in connection with the initial purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, GBT
entered into additional capped call transactions with each of the Capped Call Counterparties (which we refer to as the
“Additional Capped Call Transactions” and, together with the Base Capped Call Transactions, the “Capped Call
Transactions”).
The Capped Call Transactions initially covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares
of GBT common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is
$31.7475 per share of GBT common stock, and the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is $49.80 per share of
GBT common stock, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The
Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to GBT common stock upon conversion
of the Convertible Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that GBT could be required to make in excess of
the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject
to a cap based on the cap price.
If the Merger is consummated, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes, and the
consummation of the Merger is expected to result in the full termination of the Capped Call Transactions. The value
received by the Company in connection with the termination or unwinding of the Capped Call Transactions would be
determined by the Capped Call Counterparties based on the fair value of the Capped Call Transactions, which is
contingent on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, volatility, spot price and liquidity of GBT common
stock.
In addition, following the announcement of the Merger, the Capped Call Counterparties may adjust the terms of the
applicable Capped Call Transactions on more than one occasion to reflect the economic effect of such
announcement, including if such economic effect is material, and regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.
Each Capped Call Counterparty shall, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, in its capacity as
calculation agent with respect to its Capped Call Transaction, determine whether such announcement has had a
material economic effect on such Capped Call Transaction and may take into account a number of factors, including
the date of the announcement (and the remaining term of its Capped Call Transaction at that time), the stock price of
GBT common stock and changes in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected dividends of GBT common stock,
in determining whether an adjustment to the cap price of its Capped Call Transaction is appropriate. Each Capped Call
Counterparty may make additional adjustments to the cap price of its Capped Call Transaction following the
announcement of a change to the Merger, including a withdrawal from, or the abandonment or discontinuation of, the
Merger.
The indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the forms of confirmations containing the terms of the Capped
Call Transactions were included as exhibits, in each case, to GBT’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by GBT with the
SEC on December 17, 2021. All references in this section of this proxy statement to share counts, conversion prices
and strike prices may change from time to time in accordance with the terms of the relevant confirmations.
Certain Financial Forecasts",62,62
"Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc._20220829_DEFM14A_20311227_4510555.Pdf",Certain Financial Forecasts,"Certain Financial Forecasts
The Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to future
performance, or results of operations, earnings or other results, due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of
predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates
may not be realized. In June 2022, in connection with the evaluation of a proposed transaction, at the
52TABLE OF CONTENTS
direction of the Board, senior management of the Company with the assistance of the Company’s financial advisors
prepared certain preliminary non-public, unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through
2042. In July and August 2022, in the context of evaluating the proposals from Pfizer and other potential acquirors,
GBT senior management with the assistance of the Company’s financial advisors updated such preliminary non-
public, unaudited prospective financial information to take into account certain downward adjustments relating to,
among other things, developments and business momentum, trends and forecasts, including developments relating
to coverage, reimbursement and payor rules and policies applicable to, and pricing of, Oxbryta (which we refer to as
the “Management Forecasts”).
GBT is including a summary of the Management Forecasts to provide GBT stockholders with access to information
that was made available to the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Consideration.
The Management Forecasts were not provided to Pfizer or any of the other potential acquirors.
The Board reviewed the Management Forecasts and, following discussions with GBT management, the Board
authorized GBT’s financial advisors to use the Management Forecasts, or a subset thereof, for purposes of their
respective financial analyses and fairness opinions summarized in the sections of this proxy statement entitled “-
Opinion of J.P. Morgan” and “-Opinion of Centerview”. Management of the Company modeled the Management
Forecasts based on its reasonable best estimates and assumptions with respect to the future financial performance of
the Company on a standalone basis. The Management Forecasts were based upon certain financial, operating and
commercial assumptions developed solely using the information available to management of the Company at the time
the Management Forecasts were created.
The following table summarizes the Management Forecasts, as described above:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Important Information Concerning the Management Forecasts
The Management Forecasts were prepared for internal use only and not for public disclosure and were provided to
the Board for the purposes of GBT’s strategic review process. The Management Forecasts were also provided to and
used by J.P. Morgan and Centerview, GBT’s financial advisors, for the purpose of performing financial analyses in
connection with the strategic review process and for the purpose of evaluating the fairness of the Merger
Consideration from a financial point of view.
The summary of the Management Forecasts is included in this proxy statement solely to give GBT stockholders
access to certain financial forecasts that were made available to the Board, J.P. Morgan and Centerview and is not
being included in this proxy statement to influence a GBT stockholder’s decision whether to vote for the Merger
Agreement Proposal or for any other purpose.
The Management Forecasts were generated solely for internal use and not developed with a view toward public
disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the SEC
regarding forward-looking statements or GAAP, but, in the view of GBT management, were reasonably prepared in
good faith on a basis reflecting the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented
as of the time of preparation. No independent registered public accounting firm provided any assistance in preparing
the Management Forecasts. Accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled
or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the Management Forecasts or expressed any opinion or given
any other form of assurance with respect thereto, and they assume no responsibility for the information contained in
the Management Forecasts. The KPMG LLP report included in GBT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021 relates solely to the historical financial information of GBT and to an assessment of GBT’s
internal controls over financial reporting. Such reports do not extend to the Management Forecasts and should not
be read to do so.
The inclusion of the Management Forecasts should not be regarded as an indication that GBT, Pfizer, their affiliates
or financial advisors or any of their respective representatives or any other recipient of this information considered,
or now considers, the Management Forecasts to be necessarily predictive of future results. There can be no
assurance that the projected results will be realized or that actual results will not be materially lower or higher than
estimated, whether or not the Merger is completed. None of GBT, Parent or their respective affiliates, officers,
directors, advisors or other representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the
Management Forecasts, and, except as required by applicable law, none of GBT, Parent or their respective affiliates
undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or reconcile, the Management Forecasts to reflect
circumstances existing after the date the Management Forecasts were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future
events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Management Forecasts are shown to be
inappropriate. None of GBT or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes
any representation to any GBT stockholder or other person regarding the information included in the Management
Forecasts or GBT’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Management Forecasts or that
forecasted results will be achieved. GBT has made no representation to Parent, in the Merger Agreement or
otherwise, concerning the Management Forecasts. The Management Forecasts are forward-looking statements. The
assumptions and estimates underlying the Management Forecasts, all of which are difficult to predict and many of
which are beyond the control of GBT, may not be realized. Neither GBT nor any of its affiliates assumes any
responsibility to holders of shares of GBT common stock for the accuracy of this information. In particular, the
Management Forecasts, while presented with numerical specificity necessarily, were based on numerous variables
and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic,
competitive and regulatory risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the Management Forecasts. Because the Management Forecasts cover multiple years, by their nature,
they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each
circumstance that will have an effect on the commercial value of Oxbryta and the Company’s product candidates. As
a result, there can be no assurance that the Management Forecasts accurately reflect future trends or accurately
estimate the future market for Oxbryta and the Company’s product candidates. There can be no assurance of the
approval, or timing of such approval, of any of the Company’s clinical-stage product candidates, and it is possible
that other therapeutic scenarios will be preferable. Important factors that may affect actual results and results in the
Management Forecasts not being achieved include, but are not limited to: risks and uncertainties relating to the
COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent and duration of the impact on the Company’s business, the results of
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Company’s commercialization of Oxbryta, obtaining marketing approvals for Oxbryta in additional indications or
in additional jurisdictions, the potential safety, efficacy or other therapeutic benefits of Oxbryta and the Company’s
product candidates, maintaining the scope and extent of GBT’s intellectual property and regulatory protections, the
timing of regulatory approval and launch, success of clinical testing, labeling, market uptake of the Company’s
product candidates, the effects of healthcare reform, the effect of regulatory actions, availability of third-party
reimbursement, impact of competitive products and pricing, the effect of regulatory actions, the effect of global
economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the cost and effect of changes in tax and other
legislation and other risk factors described in GBT’s SEC filings, including GBT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on
Form 8-K, and described under the section below entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements”. The Management Forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to
change.
Modeling and forecasting the future commercialization of products and clinical, pre-clinical and research stage
product candidates is a highly speculative endeavor. In addition to the various limitations, risks and uncertainties
described above, we also cannot assure you that the Company will obtain and maintain any of the regulatory
approvals necessary for the commercialization of Oxbryta or its product candidates, or that the Company’s
competitors will not commercialize products that are safer, more effective or more successfully marketed and sold than
Oxbryta or any products that the Company may commercialize in the future. Some or all of the estimates and
assumptions underlying the Management Forecasts may have changed since the date the Management Forecasts
were prepared. The information set forth in the Management Forecasts is not fact and should not be relied upon as
being necessarily indicative of future results. The Management Forecasts were developed on a standalone basis
without giving effect to the Merger, and therefore the Management Forecasts do not give effect to the Merger or any
changes to GBT’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including
cost synergies realized as a result of the Merger, or to any costs incurred in connection with the Merger. Furthermore,
the Management Forecasts do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be completed and
should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.
The Management Forecasts contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that GBT management believes are helpful
in understanding GBT’s past financial performance and future results. GBT management regularly uses a variety of
financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP for forecasting, budgeting and measuring financial
performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
comparable GAAP measures. While GBT believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful
information to help investors understand the operating results and to analyze GBT’s financial and business trends on
a period-to-period basis, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These
non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of GBT’s
competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of GBT’s competitors due to potential
differences in the exact method of calculation. The SEC rules that would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-
GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a
board of directors or a financial advisor in connection with a proposed business combination such as the Merger if
the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP
financial measures were not relied upon by the Board or GBT’s financial advisors in connection with their respective
evaluations of the Merger. Accordingly, GBT has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures
included in the Management Forecasts to the relevant GAAP financial measures.
The Management Forecasts summarized in this section were prepared prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement
and have not been updated to reflect any changes after the date they were prepared. THE COMPANY DOES NOT
INTEND, AND UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION, TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE PROJECTIONS
TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING SINCE THEIR PREPARATION OR TO REFLECT THE
OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS
UNDERLYING THE PROJECTIONS ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE. In light of the foregoing factors and the
uncertainties inherent in the Management Forecasts, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on the Management Forecasts.

GBT’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of GBT stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these
interests in reaching the determination to approve the Merger Agreement and recommend that GBT stockholders
vote their GBT common shares to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards
At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, equity awards granted on or prior to the date of the
Merger Agreement that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as follows:
•
each outstanding Company Option, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled in exchange for the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option;
•
each outstanding Company RSU will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to
the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration;
•
each outstanding Company PSU, other than Stock Price PSUs, will be canceled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such
Company PSU immediately prior to the completion of the Merger (assuming that all applicable performance
measures are satisfied at the greater of (x) the target level of performance and (y) the actual level of
performance (measured as of the Effective Time)) and (ii) the Merger Consideration; and
•
each outstanding Stock Price PSU will be forfeited.
At the Effective Time, equity awards that may be granted to employees of the Company (including the executive
officers) after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Effective Time and that remain outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into cash awards (based on the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to the applicable award immediately prior to the
completion of the Merger) subject to the same vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding award. Upon an
executive officer’s qualifying termination within one year following the completion of the Merger, subject to the
execution of a release of claims in favor of Pfizer and the Company, any such awards would be subject to pro rata
accelerated vesting based on the number of days elapsed from the grant date to the termination date relative to the
total number of days in the vesting period.
56TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following table sets forth the number of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by each of
the Company’s directors and executive officers as of August 15, 2022, the latest practicable date to determine such
amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and the cash amounts payable (on a pre-tax basis) in respect
thereof. The amounts reflected in the table below exclude any grants that may be made following August 15, 2022 and
any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in accordance
with their terms prior to December 31, 2022 (the assumed date of the completion of the Merger solely for purposes of
this transaction-related compensation disclosure). Company Options are valued based on the difference between the
per share exercise price of such Company Option and the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share. As a result, any
Company Option included in the table below that has an exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Merger
Consideration does not have any value for purposes of the table below. Company RSUs and Company PSUs (other
than Stock Price PSUs) are valued based on the Merger Consideration of $68.50 per share. Stock Price PSUs will be
forfeited upon the consummation of the Merger and, therefore, are excluded from the amounts listed in the below
table. Payments in respect of all Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by the Company’s
directors and executive officers that were outstanding on the date of the Merger Agreement are “single-trigger” in
that they will be paid upon the consummation of the Merger.

Under the Merger Agreement, upon the Effective Time, Company PSUs (other than Stock Price PSUs) will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive cash (assuming all applicable performance measures are satisfied at the greater of (x) the
target level of performance and (y) the actual level of performance (measured as of the Effective Time)). The number of
Company PSUs shown assumes that Company PSUs subject to total shareholder return performance metrics have been earned at
the maximum level and Company PSUs subject to patient share performance metrics have been earned at the target level. Such
assumptions were made based on the Company’s latest performance estimates for the applicable performance measures, as of
August 15, 2022.
Severance Entitlements
Each of the executive officers participates in the Company’s Amended and Restated Severance and Change in
Control Policy, which we refer to as the “Severance Plan”. The Severance Plan provides for severance payments and
other benefits in the event of a “qualifying termination”, which means a termination of employment by the Company
without cause or by the executive officer for “good reason” (as described below) on or within the 12-month period
following a change in control of GBT. The Merger will constitute a change in control of GBT for purposes of the
Severance Plan. For purposes of the Severance Plan, “good reason” generally means (a) a material diminution in the
executive’s job responsibilities (provided that a change in the executive’s
57
1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
job title or reporting relationship will not be deemed a material diminution in the executive’s job responsibilities); (b) a
material diminution in the executive’s then-current base salary; or (c) the Company requiring the executive to be
based at an office location which is at least 25 miles from the executive’s then-current office location.
In the event of a qualifying termination, each executive officer would be entitled to receive: (a) a lump-sum cash
payment equal to the product of (1) the executive’s applicable multiple (which is 1.5 in the case of Dr. Love and 1.0 in
the case of all other executive officers) and (2) the sum of (x) the executive’s annual base salary and (y) the
executive’s target annual cash bonus; (b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the portion of the year in which the Effective
Time occurs (with the proration based on the executive’s date of termination); (c) subsidized health and welfare
benefits premiums for 12 months (or 18 months, in the case of Dr. Love); and (d) outplacement services. Receipt of
the above-described payments and benefits is conditioned upon the applicable executive officer executing a release
of claims in favor of the Company. The estimated aggregate value of the severance payments and benefits that the
Company’s executive officers would receive in the event of a qualifying termination on or following the completion of
the Merger is $7,016,851. The foregoing estimate is based on compensation and benefit levels in effect as of August
15, 2022. The executive officers’ outstanding unvested equity awards would be treated as described above in the
section entitled “Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Treatment of Equity and
Equity-Based Awards”.
The Severance Plan provides that in the event that any payment or benefit (regardless of whether payable under the
Severance Plan or otherwise and including the acceleration of equity awards) payable to an executive officer in
connection with his or her separation from the Company would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code, then such payment or benefit is only reduced below the limit under Section 280G of the
Code if the executive officer would end up in a better financial position than receiving the full amount and paying the
20% excise tax. The Severance Plan does not provide for a gross-up in the event the executive officer is subject to the
“golden parachute” excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.
Continuing Employee Benefits
The Merger Agreement provides that for a period of not less than one year following the Effective Time, Pfizer will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each individual who was an employee of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, which we refer to as a “continuing employee”, subject to such
individual’s continued employment, with (a) a base salary or base wage and target cash incentive opportunities that
are, in each case, no less favorable than such continuing employee’s base salary or base wage and target cash
incentive opportunities as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) long-term incentive opportunities that
are no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Pfizer, (c) severance benefits that are no
less favorable than those provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (d) other
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such continuing employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent has agreed to, or to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) recognize a continuing employee’s service with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the completion of the Merger for all purposes, including determining such
continuing employee’s eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, under benefit plans in which continuing
employees will participate after the completion of the Merger (subject to certain exceptions), (ii) cause all preexisting
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods applicable to continuing
employees under the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s welfare plans to be waived, to the extent such
limitations were waived or satisfied prior to the Effective Time and (iii) provide continuing employees with credit
under any such welfare plan for any co-payments or deductibles incurred prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to annual bonuses payable under the Company’s annual bonus plan with respect to fiscal year 2022, if
Closing occurs prior to the payment of such bonuses, Pfizer has agreed to pay such bonuses in accordance with the
terms of the annual bonus plan and fund the payment pool at no less than the level at which such pool would have
been funded assuming achievement of the target level of performance.
Director and Officer Indemnification
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Board and executive officers of the Company will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
insurance policies following the Merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the Merger Agreement
relating to director and officer indemnification, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement-Indemnification and Insurance”.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company’s named
executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the Merger and
that will or may become payable to the named executive officer either immediately at the Effective Time (i.e., on a
“single-trigger” basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment on or following the completion of the
Merger (i.e., on a “double-trigger” basis). The holders of shares of GBT common stock are being asked to approve,
on a non-binding, advisory basis, such compensation for these named executive officers. Because the vote to
approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company, the Board or Pfizer.
Accordingly, if the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement is approved by the holders of shares of GBT common
stock and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to
approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes
to the tables below and above under “-Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The
estimated values are based on (a) an assumption that the Merger is completed on December 31, 2022, (b) a per share
Merger Consideration of $68.50, (c) the named executive officers’ salary and total eligible bonus levels as in effect as
of the date of this proxy statement, (d) the number of unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
PSUs held by the named executive officers as of August 15, 2022, the latest practicable date to determine such
amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and excluding any additional grants that may occur following such
date and any Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs that are vested or are expected to vest in
accordance with their terms prior to December 31, 2022, and (e) an assumption that each named executive officer’s
employment is terminated by the Company without “cause” or by the named executive officer for “good reason”
(each, as defined in the Severance Plan) immediately following the completion of the Merger. In addition, the amounts
indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including
assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur
before the completion of the Merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive
officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
The amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any reduction that may be required as a result of a Section
280G best-net cutback; therefore, actual payments to the named executive officers may be less than the amounts
indicated below.

The estimated amounts shown in this column represent (a) a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the executive’s

(b) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, assuming a termination date of December 31, 2022. The value of the
pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, assuming a termination date of December 31, 2022, for Drs. Love and Smith-
Whitley, Messrs. Farrow and Johnson and Ms. Choi is $522,900, $255,000, $247,000, $247,000 and $239,500, respectively.

unvested Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs as shown in the following table will be paid to the named
executive officers as soon as practicable and in no event later than five business days following the Effective Time. (i.e., “single

With respect to Drs. Love and Smith-Whitley and Messrs. Farrow and Johnson, the estimated amounts shown in this column
represent the value of cash payments for a period of 12 months (or 18 months in the case of Dr. Love) following a qualifying
termination equal to the cost of continued health and dental coverage under COBRA and outplacement benefits. Since Ms. Choi
does not participate in the Company’s health insurance plan, she will not receive continued health and dental coverage under
COBRA and, therefore, the estimated amounts shown in this column only reflect the value of her outplacement benefits. The
estimated value of outplacement benefits for each named executive officer is $15,000. These are “double-trigger” benefits in that
they will be paid to the named executive officer only if the named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of
employment under the Severance Plan on or following the Effective Time.
New Management Arrangements
As of the date of this proxy statement, there are no employment, equity or other agreements, arrangements or
understandings between any of the Company’s directors or executive officers, on the one hand, and Pfizer or the
Surviving Corporation, on the other hand, and the Merger is not conditioned upon any of the Company’s directors or
executive officers entering into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration are entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares of GBT common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures described in Section 262 are
strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of GBT
60TABLE OF CONTENTS
common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as
determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. The “fair value” of your shares of GBT common stock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or
less than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the Merger
Agreement. These rights are known as “appraisal rights”. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262.
Persons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the Merger Consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. They will receive an amount determined to be
the “fair value” of their shares of GBT common stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court.
Persons considering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of GBT common stock
determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth
in Section 262 is required. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result
in the withdrawal, loss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions of
Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors
before attempting to exercise such rights.
A copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a complete statement of
the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 and any amendments
thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights
should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his, her or its legal advisor before electing or attempting
to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a
recommendation that persons seek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. A person who loses his, her or
its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.
A holder of record of shares of GBT common stock and a beneficial owner who (i) continuously holds such shares
through the Effective Time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger or otherwise
withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under Section 262, (iv) does not
thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in the case of a beneficial owner, a
person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares for which the
demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement
that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at
which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery
List (as defined below), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of GBT common stock
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the
Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
Section 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20) days before the meeting to
vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to
a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This
proxy statement constitutes the Company’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in
connection with the Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising
connection with the Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising
your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262, which may be accessed without
subscription or cost at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to comply timely and properly with the
requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.
If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of GBT common stock, you must satisfy each of the following
conditions: you must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of GBT common stock
within twenty (20) days after the giving of this notice, which must reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder
of record of shares of GBT common stock who intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of GBT common
stock and, for beneficial owners only, such demand is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial

A record holder who holds shares of GBT common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker, fiduciary,
depositary or other nominee, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all or less than all
beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the record owner. In such case, the demand must set forth the
number of shares of GBT common stock covered by such demand. Where the number of shares of GBT common
stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of GBT common stock outstanding in
the name of such record owner.
Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give written notice that the Merger has
become effective to each of (a) each GBT stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who
did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and (b) any beneficial owner who has
demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any person who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and
accept the Merger Consideration specified by the Merger Agreement for that person’s shares of GBT common stock
by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such
attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval
of the Surviving Corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the person within sixty (60) days after the
effective date, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court will be dismissed as to any person without the approval
of the Delaware Court, with such approval conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just. If the
Surviving Corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is
required, or if the Delaware Court does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the person will be
entitled to receive only the fair value of such person’s shares of GBT common stock determined by the Delaware
Court in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the Merger
Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation and any
person who has properly and timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section 262 may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in
the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the fair value of
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the shares of GBT common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal. There is no present intent on the
part of the Company or the Surviving Corporation to file an appraisal petition and persons seeking to exercise
appraisal rights should assume that the Company and the Surviving Corporation will not file such a petition or initiate
any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of GBT common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to
have their shares of GBT common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their
appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Effective Time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease and
any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the Merger Consideration under the
Merger Agreement.
In addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any person who has theretofore complied
with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving
Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of GBT common stock not consented in writing
or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were received by the
Surviving Corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within
ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days
after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.
Upon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the Surviving
Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the
office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of GBT common stock and with whom the
Surviving Corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (which we refer to as the
“Chancery List”). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court, shall give notice of the time and
place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the Surviving Corporation and to all such
person set forth on the Chancery List.
If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will
determine which persons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights provided
thereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of GBT
common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of GBT common
stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
person fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the
Delaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List and may participate fully in all
proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the
Delaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of GBT common stock taking into account all relevant factors,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its
discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound
quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time
and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving
Corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after
such payment only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the
shares of GBT common stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid
by the Surviving Corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
When the fair value of the shares of GBT common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of
such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.
Although the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of
the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an appraisal
could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover,
the Surviving Corporation does not anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any person exercising
appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the
“fair value” of the relevant shares of GBT common stock is less than the Merger Consideration.
In determining “fair value”, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an
appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme
Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be
ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.
Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such
exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only
to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware
Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered.” In addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual
circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting person’s exclusive remedy.
The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the
Delaware Court deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys’ and expert witness
fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys’ and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a
person whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in
connection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of GBT
common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such and
award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware
Court are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.
Any person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any
purpose any shares of GBT common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to GBT stockholders of record at a date
prior to the Effective Time.
At any time within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, any person who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such person’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written
withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any
person without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Delaware Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court
made under Section 262(j) of the DGCL; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the
Effective Time. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the Effective Time, or if the persons’ otherwise fail to perfect, successfully withdraw or lose such persons’ right to
appraisal, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled
only to the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement.

14a-9 promulgated thereunder.
Among other remedies, the complaints seek an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger,

The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may
be relevant to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders (each, as defined below) of shares of GBT common stock whose
shares of GBT common stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is
limited to U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders who hold their shares of GBT common stock as “capital assets” within
the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”)
(generally, property held for investment). This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated
under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the
“IRS”) and judicial decisions, each as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to
change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing
interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance
can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax
considerations described in this discussion. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of
counsel has or will be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the Merger.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the
U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and
circumstances, or to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example:
•
banks and other financial institutions;
•
mutual funds;
•
insurance companies;
•
brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
•
dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of
GBT common stock;
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
•
retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
•
tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations
and pension funds;
65TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
holders that hold shares of GBT common stock as part of a “straddle”, hedge, constructive sale, or other
integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
•
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
partnerships, other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
“S corporations”, or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in
such entities);
•
holders that own or have owned at any time (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of GBT
common stock (by vote or value);
•
holders that received their shares of GBT common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-
qualified retirement plan, pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants or otherwise as compensation;
•
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code;
•
holders subject to any alternative minimum tax;
•
grantor trusts;
•
controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies;
•
holders that hold their GBT common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch
thereof, located, organized or resident outside of the United States;
•
holders that exercise their appraisal rights in connection with the Merger;
•
holders that own, directly, indirectly or constructively, an equity interest in Parent following the Merger;
and
•
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to GBT common
stock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.
This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations
other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as the federal estate or gift tax, any alternative minimum tax, or the
application of the Medicare tax on net investment income under Section 1411 of the Code) or any state, local or non-
U.S. income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations in
respect of any withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection
therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). This discussion
does not address the tax consequences of any transaction other than the Merger.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a
beneficial owner of shares of GBT common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and
certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of GBT
common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY
PARTICULAR GBT STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE GBT STOCKHOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX
CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,
INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S.
INCOME, ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND OF CHANGES IN THOSE TAX LAWS.
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of GBT common stock that is for
U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless
of its source; or
•
a trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration
of such trust and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United
States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of GBT common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of GBT common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.
Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received
pursuant to the Merger and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of GBT common stock surrendered
pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of GBT common stock will generally equal the
amount that such U.S. Holder paid for such shares. A U.S. Holder’s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of GBT
common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss, and any such capital gain or loss generally will
be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time
of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, currently are generally
subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a
U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of GBT common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder
must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of GBT common stock
that it holds.
Non-U.S. Holders
In general, subject to the discussion below regarding potential backup withholding, the receipt of cash by a non-U.S.
Holder in exchange for shares of GBT common stock pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax unless:
•
the gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with a trade or business
conducted by the non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty,
is attributable to the non-U.S. Holder’s permanent establishment in the United States);
•
the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met; or
•
shares of GBT common stock constitute a United States real property interest by reason of GBT’s status as
a “United States real property holding corporation” within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code
(which we refer to as a “USRPHC”) at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date
of the Effective Time or the period that the non-U.S. Holder held the applicable shares of GBT common
stock (which we refer to as the “Relevant Period”).
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis
in substantially the same manner as if the non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty
provides otherwise), and if the non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be
subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable
income tax treaty) on its “effectively connected earnings and profits” for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain
items.
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
A non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a
rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain recognized, which
generally may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. Holder recognized in the same taxable year (if
any), provided the non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
With respect to the third bullet point above, GBT believes it has not been, is not and will not be a USRPHC during the
five-year period ending on the date of the Effective Time. Even if GBT is or was a USRPHC during the Relevant
Period, gain arising from a non-U.S. Holder’s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of GBT common stock pursuant
to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the GBT common stock is “regularly traded”, as defined
in applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. Holder owned, actually
and constructively, 5% or less of the GBT common stock throughout the Relevant Period.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders and non-
U.S. Holders in connection with the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder
pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed
and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that
such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise
complies with the backup withholding rules.
A non-U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax (currently, at a rate of 24%)
unless the non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS
Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such non-U.S. Holder’s status
as a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder
or a non-U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s or non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such U.S. Holder or non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY

General
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement) to cooperate in good faith and use its reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers
and consents from, the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with any governmental entity
with respect to the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) the defending or contesting
of any proceedings challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, in each case as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement-Other
Covenants-Efforts to Consummate the Merger”. The approvals required under the Merger Agreement include expiry
or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, as well as the receipt of certain non-U.S. antitrust approvals.
68TABLE OF CONTENTS
We currently expect to complete the Merger as early as the fourth quarter of 2022. However, we cannot predict the
exact timing of completion of the Merger because we cannot guarantee when all required antitrust and other required
regulatory approvals will be obtained, or if they will be obtained at all.
U.S. Regulatory Clearances
Under the HSR Act, the Merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the Merger has expired or
been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day
waiting period following the parties’ filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade
Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer
to as the “DOJ”) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a
“Second Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day
waiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request,
unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period. GBT made
the filing required under the HSR Act on August 26, 2022, and we currently expect Parent to make the filing required
under the HSR Act by August 29, 2022, in which case the initial 30-day waiting period will be scheduled to expire at
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 28, 2022, unless otherwise extended.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary
or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take
such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could
include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.
Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be
certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Other Regulatory Clearances
The Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approval (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed
between the parties) in Germany (pursuant to the Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz gegen
Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen)). The parties made the required filings with the German Federal Cartel Office
(Bundeskartellamt) on August 26, 2022. If, prior to the Effective Time, a merger control inquiry is initiated by a
governmental entity in certain specified jurisdictions, the Merger will also be subject to (a) regulatory approval in
such jurisdiction or (b) confirmation that the inquiry has ended (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between
the parties). In each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory
laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or
requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. We
cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

The following summarizes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger
Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger
Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all of the
information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are
governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information
contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement
(a) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (b) were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (c) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by GBT, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in
connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties
have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between GBT, Parent
and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable
to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. GBT stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries
under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or
any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of GBT, Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely
on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of GBT, Parent and
Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential
disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent
may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex
A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual
information regarding GBT, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should
read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding GBT and our
business. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find More

The Merger Agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into GBT, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease and GBT will continue its corporate existence as the Surviving Corporation,
becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. From and after the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement and the DGCL, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and
authority of GBT and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of each of GBT and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.
The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the directors of Merger Sub as of the Effective Time, each to
hold office until his or her respective successor is duly elected and qualified, or such director’s earlier death,
resignation or removal. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the officers of GBT as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office until his or her respective successor is duly elected and qualified, or
such officer’s earlier death, resignation or removal.
At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated to be
in the form of the certificate of incorporation attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement and, as so amended and
restated, will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that the name of
the Surviving Corporation will be “Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.”), in each case until as thereafter changed or
amended in accordance with applicable law.

benefits thereof of those conditions), or at such other place, time and date agreed to in writing by the parties.
At the Closing, the parties will file a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Secretary of State for the
State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL.
Merger Consideration
GBT Common Stock
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of GBT, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of GBT or Merger Sub, each share of GBT common stock (other than Excluded GBT Shares)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted automatically into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration of $68.50 in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding.
Treatment of GBT Equity Awards
At the Effective Time, subject to all required withholding taxes, equity awards granted on or prior to the date of the
Merger Agreement that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as follows:
•
each outstanding Company Option, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled in exchange for the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option;
•
each outstanding Company RSU will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to
the completion of the Merger multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration;
•
each outstanding Company PSU, other than Stock Price PSUs, will be canceled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of GBT common stock subject to such
Company PSU immediately prior to the completion of the Merger (assuming that all applicable performance
measures are satisfied at the greater of (x) the target level of performance and (y) the actual level of
performance (measured as of the Effective Time)) and (ii) the Merger Consideration; and
•
each outstanding Stock Price PSU will be forfeited.
At the Effective Time, equity awards that may be granted to employees of the Company after the date of the Merger
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time and that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted into cash awards (based on the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of GBT
common stock subject to the applicable award immediately prior to the completion of the Merger) subject to the same
vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding award.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to effectuate the actions required by Section
5.04 of the Merger Agreement. All amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.04 of the Merger Agreement shall be
subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest.
As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days following the
Effective Time), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay (through its payroll systems in the case
of employees) all amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.04(a) of the Merger Agreement to the former holders of
Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs, as applicable; provided, however,
71
TABLE OF CONTENTS
that, to the extent any such amounts relate to a Company Option, Company RSU or Company PSU that constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such amounts shall be paid at the earliest
time following the Effective Time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement or Company Stock Plan
relating to such Company Option, Company RSU or Company PSU that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section
409A of the Code.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary (including obtaining any
resolutions of the Board or, if appropriate, any committee designated thereby) to provide that (i) no new offering or
new purchase period will commence following the date hereof unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated;
(ii) from and after the date hereof, no new participants will be permitted to participate in the Company ESPP and
participants will not be permitted to increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on
the date of the Merger Agreement; and (iii) the Company ESPP shall terminate effective no later than ten (10)
business days prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall determine the rights of participants in the Company
ESPP with respect to the offering period underway under the Company ESPP as of the date hereof by treating a
business day to be determined by the Company as the last day of such offering period (the “Final Investment Date”),
which business day shall be no later than either (x) the date on which such offering period would expire by its terms
or (y) the date on which the Company ESPP is terminated, and by treating such shortened offering period as a fully
effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP. The Company shall treat any
shares of GBT common stock acquired prior to or on the Final Investment Date as outstanding shares of GBT
common stock for purposes of Section 2.07(c) of the Merger Agreement.
“Company Stock Plans” means the Company Amended and Restated 2017 Inducement Equity Plan, the Company
Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the Company 2012 Stock Option and Grant Plan and

"Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc._20220829_DEFM14A_20311227_4510555.Pdf",Exchange and Payment Procedures,"Exchange and Payment Procedures
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as paying agent (which we refer to as the “Paying Agent”) to make payments of the Merger Consideration to former
GBT stockholders and act as agent for former GBT stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their
certificates representing shares of GBT common stock (which we refer to as “certificates”) and non-certificated
shares of GBT common stock represented by book-entry (which we refer to as “book-entry shares”). On or prior to
the Closing Date, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash necessary to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all shares of GBT common stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Excluded GBT Shares) (which we refer to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent
will invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, subject to certain limitations set forth in the
Merger Agreement and provided that any loss of any of the funds included in the Exchange Fund will not alter
Parent’s obligations to pay the Merger Consideration. In the event the Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration for all shares of GBT common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Excluded GBT Shares), Parent will promptly deposit (or cause to be deposited) additional funds with
the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the shortfall required to make such payment.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event not later than the third business day
following the Effective Time), (a) the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
(other than holders of Excluded GBT Shares) whose shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant
to the Merger Agreement (i) a letter of transmittal in such form as is customary and as Parent and GBT may mutually
agree and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (b)
the Paying Agent will mail a check, or make a wire transfer, to each holder of book-entry shares whose shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The amount of any Merger
Consideration paid to GBT stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.
Upon surrender of certificates or book-entry shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal (if
required), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such certificates or book-entry shares
(other than holders of Excluded GBT Shares) will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
72TABLE OF CONTENTS
an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of GBT common stock formerly represented by
such holder’s properly surrendered certificates or book-entry shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration,
subject to all required tax withholding. If payment is to be made in respect of any book-entry shares to a Person other
than the Person in whose name such book-entry shares are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such book-entry shares or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent and the Paying Agent that such book-entry shares were properly transferred and that such tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. In the case of certificates, in the event of a transfer of ownership of GBT common stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the certificate so surrendered is registered, if such certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
In the case of any certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate
an amount in cash (after giving effect to any tax withholding as provided in the Merger Agreement and excluding any
amounts for interest) equal to (x) the number of shares of GBT common stock formerly represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to
GBT stockholders for one year after the Closing Date will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former GBT
stockholder who has not surrendered its shares of GBT common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement will
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest, upon due
surrender of their shares of GBT common stock.

Each of the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, the Company, Surviving Corporation and Parent (and any other applicable
withholding agent) is entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration and any other payments otherwise
payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any Person such amount as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.
Amounts so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority will be treated as having been

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of GBT, Parent and Merger Sub.
Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by GBT are qualified as to “materiality” or
“Company Material Adverse Effect”. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect”
means any change, event, condition, development, circumstance, effect or occurrence that, individually or in the
aggregate, (a) has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) would or
would reasonably be expected to prevent or impair the consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date, provided
that, for purposes of clause (a), none of the following, or any change, event, effect, condition, development,
circumstance or occurrence to the extent resulting from or arising in connection with the following, will constitute or
be taken into account in determining whether a “Company Material Adverse Effect” has occurred:
•
changes in general conditions in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate;
•
changes in general economic or regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities, credit, financial
or other capital markets conditions (including changes generally in prevailing interest rates, currency
exchange rates, credit markets and price levels or trading volumes), in each case in the United States or
elsewhere in the world;
73TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
changes after August 7, 2022 in applicable Law or GAAP (or the authoritative interpretation thereof);

or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics before, on or after
August 7, 2022, or changes or prospective changes in the market price or trading volume of the GBT
common stock or the credit rating of the Company (it being understood that the underlying facts giving rise
or contributing to such failure or change may be taken into account in determining whether there has been
a Company Material Adverse Effect if such facts are not otherwise excluded under this definition);
•
the announcement or performance of any of the Transactions, including any stockholder (direct or
derivative) Proceeding in respect of the Merger Agreement or any of the Transactions, actions specifically
required by the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement (excluding the Company operating in the
ordinary course of business) and any loss of or change in relationship, contractual or otherwise, with any
customer, Governmental Entity, supplier, vendor, investor, licensor, licensee, distributor or other business
partner, or departure of any employee or officer, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case, to
the extent resulting from or arising in connection with such announcement or performance; provided,
however, that the exception contained in this bullet does not apply to certain specified representations and
warranties to the extent the purpose of such representation or warranty is to address the consequences
resulting from the announcement, performance, execution or delivery of the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions;
•
any action taken by the Company or any of its subsidiaries at Parent’s written request or with Parent’s
written consent or that is expressly required by the Merger Agreement;
•
the identity of Parent or Merger Sub as the acquirer of the Company; and

provided that to the extent that any of the changes, events, conditions, developments, circumstances, effects or
occurrences in the first through sixth bullets disproportionately affect the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared with other participants in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate, the
incremental disproportionate impact or impacts may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Company Material Adverse Effect.
In the Merger Agreement, GBT has made customary representations and warranties to Parent and Merger Sub that
are subject, in some cases, to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement. These
representations and warranties relate to, among other things:

Restrictions on Solicitation of Company Takeover Proposals; The Board’s Recommendation; Change of
Recommendation
The Company shall not, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective Representatives acting on its or their behalf not to:
•
directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate the making of any inquiry, offer or
proposal which constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal; or
•
directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to assist, facilitate or encourage any effort by any
Person, in each case in connection with or in response to any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal.
The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, immediately after
the execution of the Merger Agreement, (i) cease all solicitations, discussions and negotiations regarding any
inquiry, proposal or offer pending on August 7, 2022 that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Company Takeover Proposal, and (ii) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible
Company Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the above or any other provision of the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval:
•
the Company may contact the Person making any Company Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms
and conditions thereof; and
•
in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section
4.02(a) of the Merger Agreement and that the Board reasonably determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Company Proposal and in respect of which the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a “Qualifying Company Takeover
Proposal”), the Company may:
○
furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such Qualifying Company
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement so
long as the Company also provides Parent, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such
information is provided or made available to such Person, in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, any non-public information furnished to such other Person which was not
previously furnished to Parent, except to the extent providing Parent with such information would
violate applicable Law; and
○
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal.
The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) advise
Parent of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) any inquiry or request for discussions, negotiations or non-
public information with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal.
The Company will provide Parent promptly (and in any event within such forty-eight (48)-hour period) with the
identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request and a correct and complete
copy of such Company Takeover Proposal inquiry or request (or, where such Company Takeover Proposal is not in
writing, a description of the material terms and conditions of such Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request,
including any modifications thereto). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status (and in any
event no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or
negotiations) of any such Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request (including the material terms and
conditions thereof and of any modification thereto), and any material developments, discussions and negotiations,
including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation. The Company will not,
and will cause each Company Subsidiary not to, enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to August 7,
2022 that would restrict the
78
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company’s ability to provide such information to Parent. The Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided or made available in accordance
with Section 4.02(d) of the Merger Agreement which was not previously provided or made available to Parent.
Neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall:
•
(A) withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Board Recommendation, (B)
fail to make the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (C) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover
Proposal or resolve or agree to take any such action (any action described in this bullet being referred to
herein as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”); or
•
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
in accordance with Section 4.02 of the Merger Agreement), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take
any such action.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Merger Agreement to the contrary, prior to the date on which the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Board determines in good faith, (i) after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor, that a Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal after
giving effect to all of the adjustments of the Merger Agreement that are offered in writing by Parent during the Notice
Period, and (ii) after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board may:
•
make an Adverse Recommendation Change; or
•
terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) of the Merger Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.04(b) of the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Company Proposal;
provided further that the Board may not effect a change of its recommendation in accordance with clause (A) above
in connection with a Superior Company Proposal or terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with clause (B)
above unless:
•
the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent, at least three (3) business days in advance (the
“Notice Period”), of its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Company Proposal,
which notice will specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Company Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Company Proposal), and has contemporaneously
provided a correct and complete copy of the proposed agreement with respect to such Superior Company
Proposal;
•
prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating the Merger Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Company Proposal, the Company has, and has
caused its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement so that such Company Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Company Proposal;
and
•
following any negotiation described in the immediately preceding bullet, the Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor, that such Company Takeover Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Company Proposal after the start of the Notice Period, the
Company is required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of Section 4.02(e)
of the Merger Agreement with respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period will be deemed to have
recommenced on the date of such new notice, except that the references to three (3) business days will be deemed
two (2) business days.
Notwithstanding any provision in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, the Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Board has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change on account of the
Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided, however, that the
Board will not make an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company has (i) provided to Parent at least
three (3) business days’ prior written notice advising Parent that the Board intends to take such action and
specifying the Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail and (ii) during such three (3)-business day period, if
requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend the Merger Agreement in such a
manner that obviates the need or reason for the Adverse Recommendation Change.
Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement prohibits the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (including any “stop, look and listen”
letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law.
“Company Takeover Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group relating to, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions (i) any direct or indirect acquisition, purchase, sale, license, lease or
other disposition of (A) 20% or more (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the
Board) of the assets (including capital stock of the Company Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company
or any resulting parent company of the Company, (ii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the
Company that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person) owning,
directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company or of the
surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity, other than, in each
case, the Transactions, or (iii) any combination of the foregoing.
“Intervening Event” means a material event, fact, circumstance, development, occurrence or change not known to or
reasonably foreseeable by the Board at the time the Board initially resolved to make the Board Recommendation (or if
known or reasonably foreseeable, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which
event, fact, circumstance, development, occurrence or change becomes known to the Board prior to the date on
which the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, other than (i) changes in the GBT common stock price, in and
of itself (however, the underlying reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event), or (ii) any
Company Takeover Proposal.
“Superior Company Proposal” means any bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal that, if
consummated, would result in a Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person) owning, directly or indirectly, (a)
50% or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or (b) 50% or more (based on the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board) of the assets (including capital stock of the Company
Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms which the Board determines,
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, would result in greater value to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms
and conditions (including all financial, regulatory, financing, conditionality, legal and other terms and conditions) of
such proposal and the Merger Agreement (taking into account amendments and modifications to the Merger
Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to Section 4.02(e) of the Merger Agreement) and (ii) that, relative to the
Transactions, is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, financing, timing, conditionality, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide to each individual who is employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Company Employee”) for so long as such individual
remains so employed, (i) annual base salary or base wage and target cash incentive opportunities that are each no
less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Company Employee by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) long-term incentive opportunities that are no less favorable
than those provided by Parent or its affiliates to similarly situated employees, (iii) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those provided to such Continuing Company Employee by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Company Employee by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Continuation Period, the Continuing Company Employees shall
be entitled to participate in the plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates (the “Surviving
Corporation Plans”) to the same extent as other similarly situated employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective affiliates. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section
5.05(d) of the Merger Agreement, each Continuing Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Surviving Corporation Plans to the extent coverage under any such plan
replaces coverage under a comparable benefit plan in which such Continuing Company Employee participates
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in Section 5.05 of the Merger Agreement or elsewhere in the Merger
Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Continuing Company Employee to employment with Parent or
the Surviving Corporation.
With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any “employee benefit plan”, as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time off and severance plans),
for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, each Continuing
Company Employee’s service with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor
employer is recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or any
of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service or for any purpose under any pension or
retirement plan, postretirement welfare plan or any plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its
affiliates do not receive credit for prior service or that is grandfathered or frozen. In addition, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit each Continuing Company Employee with paid time off equal to the paid
time off such Continuing Company Employee had accrued with the Company or any Company Subsidiary that was
unused immediately prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which any Continuing Company
Employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied or did not apply to such
employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which
such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide Continuing Company Employees
and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan.

Prior the Closing Date, the Company shall, or shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices of
prepayment with respect to the loans outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement (contingent upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time) and use reasonable best efforts to take all other actions reasonably requested
81TABLE OF CONTENTS
by Parent required to facilitate at or prior to the Effective Time the termination of all commitments outstanding under
the Company Credit Agreement, the repayment in full of all obligations outstanding thereunder, the release of all
Liens securing such obligations, and the release of all guarantees in connection therewith (the “Company Credit
Agreement Termination”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent at least three (3) business days prior to the
Closing Date a draft payoff letter and release documentation and (ii) deliver to Parent at least one (1) business day
prior to the Closing Date an executed payoff letter and related release documentation, in each case, with respect to
the obligations under the Company Credit Agreement (the “Payoff Letter”), in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type, from the agent under the Company Credit Agreement, which Payoff Letter and executed
related release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount and provide that Liens (and
guarantees), if any, granted in connection with the Company Credit Agreement relating to the assets, rights and
properties of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness shall, upon the payment of
the amount set forth in the Payoff Letter at or prior to the Effective Time, be released and terminated. Notwithstanding
anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Section 5.06(a) of the Merger Agreement require
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to cause the Company Credit Agreement Termination to be
effective unless and until the Effective Time has occurred and Parent has provided or caused to be provided to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries funds (or Parent has directed the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to use funds on their balance sheet) to pay in full the then-outstanding principal amount of and accrued
and unpaid interest and fees under the Company Credit Agreement.
Within the time periods required by the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture, the Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to, take all actions reasonably requested by Parent required by the Convertible Notes
Indenture and applicable Law to be performed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary at or prior to the
Effective Time as a result of the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including the giving of any notices that may be required and delivery to the trustee, holders or other
applicable Person, as applicable, of any documents or instruments required to be delivered at or prior to the Effective
Time to such trustee, holders or other applicable Person, in each case in connection with the execution and delivery
of the Merger Agreement, the Transactions or as otherwise required by the Convertible Notes Indenture; provided
that the Company (or the applicable Company Subsidiary) shall deliver a copy of any such notice or other document
to Parent at least three (3) business days prior to delivering or entering into such notice or other document in
accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture and shall consider Parent’s comments thereto in good
faith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees to cooperate
with Parent, at Parent’s written request, by (i) executing and delivering (or causing to be executed and delivered, as
applicable) at the Effective Time, as applicable, one or more supplemental indentures, officer’s certificates and
opinions of counsel, in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, pursuant to the Convertible
Notes Indenture and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under the Convertible Notes Indenture
to execute at the Effective Time any such supplemental indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to execute and deliver any document, certificate or
instrument pursuant to Section 5.06(b) of the Merger Agreement (or cause any such document, certificate or
instrument to be executed or delivered) that is not conditioned on or delivered prior to or substantially concurrently
with the occurrence of the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to its efforts to settle the Capped
Call Transactions (which settlement shall occur no earlier than the Effective Time) and the negotiation of any
termination or settlement payment or valuation related thereto; provided that nothing in Section 5.06(c) of the Merger
Agreement shall require the Company to (A) pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any
payment in connection with any Capped Call Transaction prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time, (B) enter into
or effect any settlement, termination, instrument or agreement, or agree to any settlement, termination or any other
change or modification to any instrument or agreement, that is effective prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time
or (C) refrain from delivering, or delay the delivery of, any notice required by the terms of the Capped Call
Transactions.
As promptly as practical, subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.05(c) of the Convertible Notes Indenture
and solely to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and in any event no later than the 380th day after the original
issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company shall remove the Restrictive Legend (as defined in

Notes, and cause such Convertible Notes to be assigned an unrestricted CUSIP number as a result thereof, in each

All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (and rights to advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective
Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to August 7, 2022, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors (each, an “Indemnified Party”) as provided in the Company Charter, the Company By-laws,
the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect as of August 7,
2022, (i) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without further action, at the Effective Time, (ii) shall survive
the Merger, (iii) shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against
any such Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions for the period beginning as of the Effective Time
and ending six years from the Effective Time and (iv) shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for the period beginning as of
the Effective Time and ending six years from the Effective Time. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation
complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.
In addition, without limiting Section 5.07(a) of the Merger Agreement or any rights of any Indemnified Party pursuant
to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors or (ii) the Merger Agreement or any of the Transactions, and in each case pertaining to
matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether in any case asserted or arising before
or after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall,
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law upon receipt of appropriate undertakings in favor of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation to repay
such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under Section 5.07(b) of the
Merger Agreement), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Proceeding. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall at their own expense cooperate with an Indemnified
Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder. Parent’s
and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under Section 5.07(b) of the Merger Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect for the period beginning as of the Effective Time and ending six years from the Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.
The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or “tail”) directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions) for the period beginning as of the Effective Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, covering
each Indemnified Party and containing terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions
(including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are in the aggregate no less favorable to any Indemnified
Party than those of the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in effect on August 7, 2022 (the
“Existing D&O Policies”); provided, however, that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such “tail” insurance
policies for any such year shall not exceed the maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by the second
succeeding sentence. If such “tail” insurance policies have been obtained by the Company, Parent shall cause such
“tail” insurance policies to be maintained in full force and effect, for their full term (but in any event shall not be
required to cause such policies to be maintained for any period
83TABLE OF CONTENTS
more than six years from the Effective Time), and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation. In the event the Company does not obtain such “tail” insurance policies, then, Parent shall either

the Effective Time, cause the Existing D&O Policies to be maintained in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of the Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time); provided, however,
that, in any case, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium
for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium payable by the Company for coverage for its
current fiscal year under the Existing D&O Policies; provided further that if the aggregate annual premium of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most
advantageous policy (as determined in Parent’s good faith discretion) available for an aggregate annual premium not
exceeding such amount; and provided further that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing terms (including with respect to
coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party.
In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (A)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets
to any Person or (ii) Parent or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or
transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in Section 5.07 of the Merger Agreement. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under Section 5.07 of the Merger Agreement shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom Section 5.07 of the Merger
Agreement applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of Section 5.07 of the
Merger Agreement are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which
each Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.
Parent shall pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in
Section 5.07 of the Merger Agreement.

to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions or make materially more difficult the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(a) or 6.01(b) of the Merger Agreement.
Nothing in Section 5.03 of the Merger Agreement will apply to or restrict communications or other actions by Parent,

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, GBT is required to submit a
proposal to GBT stockholders to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to GBT’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Compensation Proposal). This compensation is
summarized in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement-Interests of GBT’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger”. The Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer
Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, GBT is asking you to
approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of GBT approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will
or may become payable to GBT’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement-Interests of GBT’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”.
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement
Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve the
Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not
be binding on GBT. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the
vote on this Compensation Proposal.
Approval, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the
outstanding shares of GBT common stock properly cast for the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting,
provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special
Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the
outcome of the Compensation Proposal and (c) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the
Compensation Proposal. shares of GBT common stock of GBT common stock represented by properly executed,
timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a GBT
stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of GBT
common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a
quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting (the Adjournment Proposal). If GBT stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could
adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit
additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from GBT stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against the Merger Agreement Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment
Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the
Merger Agreement Proposal such that the Merger Agreement Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the
Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares
to change their votes to votes in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the
Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal (a) when a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares of GBT common stock properly cast for and against the Adjournment Proposal, and (b) when a quorum is not
present, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of GBT common stock representing a majority of the
voting power present at the Special Meeting.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect
on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment
Proposal and (c) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. If a
quorum is not present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
Shares of GBT common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted
in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a GBT stockholder returns a signed proxy card without
indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of GBT common stock represented by that proxy will be
counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such
shares will be voted as recommended by the Board.
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

The following table sets forth information regarding ownership of GBT common stock by:
•
each person or group of affiliated persons known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of
outstanding GBT common stock;
•
each of our current directors;
•
each of our named executive officers; and
•
all current executive officers and directors as a group.
We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership of 67,475,564 shares of common stock
outstanding on August 15, 2022.
Each individual or entity shown in the table has furnished information with respect to beneficial ownership. The
information with respect to each individual or entity is as of August 15, 2022, unless otherwise noted. The
information with respect to certain significant stockholders is based on filings by the beneficial owners with the SEC
pursuant to Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance
with the SEC’s rules. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole
or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition, the rules include shares of
common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options that are either immediately exercisable or exercisable
on or before October 14, 2022, which is 60 days after August 15, 2022. These shares are deemed to be outstanding
and beneficially owned by the person holding those stock options for the purpose of computing the percentage
ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage
ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities identified in this table have sole
voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable
community property laws.

Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the “Company”), of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the
Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 7, 2022 (the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror
and its subsidiary, Ribeye Acquisition Corp. (“Acquisition Sub”), the Company will merge with and into Acquisition
Sub and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common
Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, the
Acquiror, Acquisition Sub or any other subsidiary of the Acquiror and other than Appraisal Shares (as defined in the
Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $68.50 per share in cash (the “Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available
business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared
the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions
involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the financial
and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies
we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and certain
publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts
prepared by or at the direction of the management of the Company relating to its business; and (vi) performed such
other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the
purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was
publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We
have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement. We have
also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and
the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal,
regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such
issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or
on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available

B-1TABLE OF CONTENTS
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion
and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock
in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection
with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company
or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion
with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the
Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company
Common Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee
from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed
Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. Please be advised that during the two years preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor our
affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking
relationships with the Company. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had
commercial or investment banking relationships with the Acquiror, for which we and such affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and joint
bookrunner on the Acquiror’s credit facility in November 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on the Acquiror’s offering
of debt securities in August 2021. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under
outstanding credit facilities of the Acquiror, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits.
In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each
of the Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade
the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the
Company or the Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time
hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid
to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This
letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the
purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This
opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose
whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information
statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without
our prior written approval.
Very truly yours,

The Board of Directors

The Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of
Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), of the $68.50 per Share in cash, without
interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger proposed to be entered
into (the “Agreement”) by and among Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), Ribeye Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company. The Agreement
provides that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the “Transaction”), as a result of which the Company will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger (other than (i) Appraisal Shares (as defined in the Agreement) and (ii) Shares owned directly by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (the shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii),
together with any Shares held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent, “Excluded Shares”)) will be converted into
the right to receive $68.50 per Share in cash (the $68.50 per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the
“Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We
will receive a fee for our services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the
rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger for
completing our evaluation, which is not contingent upon our rendering a favorable opinion. In addition, the Company
has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out
of our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment
banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the past two years, except for our current
engagement, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to the Company, and we have
not received any compensation from the Company during such period. In the past two years, we have been engaged
to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to Parent, for which we have received compensation,
including in connection with Parent’s acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2022 and certain other strategic
matters. We may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company or Parent or their
respective affiliates in the future, for which we may receive compensation. Certain (i) of our and our affiliates’
directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of our affiliates or related
investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial
interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the
Company, Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.

Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.

The Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of
Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), of the $68.50 per Share in cash, without
interest, proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger proposed to be entered
into (the “Agreement”) by and among Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), Ribeye Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company. The Agreement
provides that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the “Transaction”), as a result of which the Company will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each issued and outstanding Share immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger (other than (i) Appraisal Shares (as defined in the Agreement) and (ii) Shares owned directly by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (the shares referred to in clauses (i) and (ii),
together with any Shares held by any affiliate of the Company or Parent, “Excluded Shares”)) will be converted into
the right to receive $68.50 per Share in cash (the $68.50 per Share consideration to be paid in the Merger, the
“Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction. We
will receive a fee for our services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which is payable upon the
rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger for
completing our evaluation, which is not contingent upon our rendering a favorable opinion. In addition, the Company
has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out
of our engagement.
We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment
banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the past two years, except for our current
engagement, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to the Company, and we have
not received any compensation from the Company during such period. In the past two years, we have been engaged
to provide financial advisory services unrelated to the Company to Parent, for which we have received compensation,
including in connection with Parent’s acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2022 and certain other strategic
matters. We may provide financial advisory and other services to or with respect to the Company or Parent or their
respective affiliates in the future, for which we may receive compensation. Certain (i) of our and our affiliates’
directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of our affiliates or related
investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial
interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the
Company, Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.

part of the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Company
Common Stock”) or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:
(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Company Common Stock Held by Company
Subsidiaries. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
directly by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock directly held by any wholly owned Company Subsidiary or by
any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any,
shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such entity owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time as such entity owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time.
(c) Conversion of Other Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 1.07(b) and Section 1.07(d), each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive $68.50 in cash,
without interest (the “Merger Consideration” ). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.08, without interest.
(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company
Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”) (such shares, “Appraisal Shares”) shall not be converted
into the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.07(c), but instead shall be canceled, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled only to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to
such Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to
be paid such consideration as is determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.07(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and
any withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations

bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the
payment of the Merger Consideration to former holders of Company Common Stock and, in connection therewith,
prior to the Effective Time, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. Parent shall take all steps necessary to provide or cause to be provided to the Paying Agent, on or prior to
the Closing Date, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive cash pursuant to Section 1.07(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).
A-2TABLE OF CONTENTS
(b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”) which were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are customary
and reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for
cancelation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented
by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.07, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for any such
transfer or other Taxes. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.08, each Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 1.07. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.
(c) Treatment of Book-Entry Shares. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than three business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail a check, or make a wire transfer, to each holder, as of the Effective Time of the Merger,
of Book-Entry Shares in an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration,
without interest, to which such holder is entitled hereunder. If payment is to be made in respect of any Book-
Entry Shares to a Person other than the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Book-Entry Shares or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Book-Entry Shares were
properly transferred and that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for any such transfer or other Taxes.
(d) Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
Company Common Stock) shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares of
Company Common Stock or other similar transaction, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, stock dividend or other similar transaction. Nothing in
this Section 1.08(d) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or
restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.
(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this Article I as a result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
A-3
TABLE OF CONTENTS
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.
(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger
Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of its claim for such Merger Consideration.
(g) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such date, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.
(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent. In no event, however, shall such investment or any such payment of interest or income delay the
receipt by former holders of Company Common Stock of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such
holders’ rights hereunder. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the
Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent
to promptly pay the Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such
payments.
(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration, without interest.
(j) Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or under any other federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation. The Company will not, and will cause each
Company Subsidiary not to, enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Company’s ability to provide such information to Parent. The Company will
promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary
provided or made available in accordance with this Section 4.02(d) which was not previously provided or made
available to Parent. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) fail to make the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (C) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to
take any such action (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to herein as an “Adverse
Recommendation Change”) or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement relating to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 4.02), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any
such action.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the date on which the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company Board determines in good faith, (i) after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor, that a Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Company Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments of this Agreement that are offered in
writing by Parent during the Notice Period, and (ii) after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company Board may (A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.01(f) in accordance with Section 7.04(b) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Company Proposal; provided further that the Company Board may
A-26
TABLE OF CONTENTS
not effect a change of its recommendation in accordance with clause (A) above in connection with a Superior
Company Proposal or terminate this Agreement in accordance with clause (B) above unless (I) the Company has
provided prior written notice to Parent, at least three (3) business days in advance (the “Notice Period”), of its
intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Company Proposal, which notice will specify the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Company Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Company Proposal), and has contemporaneously provided a correct and complete copy
of the proposed agreement with respect to such Superior Company Proposal, (II) prior to effecting such
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Company Proposal, the Company has, and has caused its Representatives to, during
the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Takeover Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Company Proposal and (III) following any negotiation described in clause (II) above, the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor,
that such Company Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal. In the event of
any material revisions to the Superior Company Proposal after the start of the Notice Period, the Company is
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 4.02(e)
with respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period will be deemed to have recommenced on the date
of such new notice, except that the references to three (3) business days will be deemed two (2) business days.
Any Adverse Recommendation Change will not change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of
causing any state takeover statute or other Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.
(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board has concluded in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
on account of the Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
provided, however, that the Company Board will not make an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company has (i) provided to Parent at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail
and (ii) during such three (3)-business day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations
with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need or reason for the Adverse
Recommendation Change.
(g) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act (including any “stop, look and listen” letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law; provided that this Section 4.02(g) will not be deemed to
permit the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, except to the extent permitted by
Section 4.02(e) and Section 4.02(f) (it being understood that any disclosure of information to the Company’s
stockholders that describes the Company’s receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto and contains a statement reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation shall
not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change).
(h) For purposes of this Agreement:
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a customary confidentiality agreement that contains
confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a “standstill” or
similar obligation to the extent that Parent is, in writing delivered to Parent no later than concurrently with the
entry by the Company or any Company Subsidiary into such confidentiality agreement, released from any
“standstill” or other similar obligation in the Confidentiality Agreement.
“Company Takeover Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group relating to, in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions (i) any direct or indirect acquisition, purchase, sale, license,
lease or other disposition of (A) 20% or more (based on the fair market value thereof, as
A-27
TABLE OF CONTENTS
determined in good faith by the Company Board) of the assets (including capital stock of the Company
Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the aggregate
voting power of the capital stock of the Company or any resulting parent company of the Company, (ii) any
tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company that, if consummated, would
result in any Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person) owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of
the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity or the resulting direct
or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity, other than, in each case, the Transactions, or (iii) any
combination of the foregoing.
“Intervening Event” means a material event, fact, circumstance, development, occurrence or change not known
to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board at the time the Company Board initially resolved to make
the Company Board Recommendation (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the consequences of which were
not known or reasonably foreseeable), which event, fact, circumstance, development, occurrence or change
becomes known to the Company Board prior to the date on which the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, other than (i) changes in the Company Common Stock price, in and of itself (however, the underlying
reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event), or (ii) any Company Takeover Proposal.
“Superior Company Proposal” means any bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal that, if
consummated, would result in a Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person) owning, directly or
indirectly, (a) 50% or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company or of the surviving
entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or (b) 50% or more
(based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Company Board) of the assets
(including capital stock of the Company Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (i) on terms which the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisor, would result in greater value to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point
of view than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and conditions (including all financial,
regulatory, financing, conditionality, legal and other terms and conditions) of such proposal and this Agreement
(taking into account amendments and modifications to this Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to Section
4.02(e)) and (ii) that, relative to the Transactions, is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, financing, timing, conditionality, legal and other aspects
of such proposal.
Wherever the term “group” is used in this Section 4.02(h), it is used as defined in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange
Act.

limitation is necessary in light of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures, including if providing such access would
reasonably be expected to pose a material risk to the general health and safety of employees of the Company or the
applicable Company Subsidiary and which cannot be mitigated with commercially reasonable measures. All

similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all action necessary to

offer or similar transaction) or the acquisition of any assets, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses

of the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub shall be required to commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to any amendments or modifications to any

(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties’ obligations under Section 5.03(a), and in furtherance thereof,
Parent and the Company shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other, (i) file, within fifteen (15) business

filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act or any Foreign Merger Control Law, (ii) give the
other party reasonable prior notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent reasonably practicable,

Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to comply with any inquiry
or request from the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity as promptly as reasonably practicable and
(v) consult with one another in connection with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation by, or

Transactions, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with any Governmental
Entity relating thereto. Any such additional information shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements
of the HSR Act or the applicable Foreign Merger Control Law, as the case may be. Each party will bear its own
costs of preparing its own pre-merger notifications and similar filings and notices in other jurisdictions and
related expenses incurred to obtain all required regulatory approvals under the HSR Act or any applicable
Foreign Merger Control Law, provided that Parent shall bear all filing fees for the filings required under the HSR
Act or any applicable Foreign Merger Control Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent will determine and control strategy for dealing with any Governmental Entity

under this Section 5.03 to provide information to another party (a “Receiving Party”) that the Disclosing Party
deems to be competitively sensitive information or otherwise reasonably determines in respect thereof that
disclosure should be restricted, the Disclosing Party may restrict the provision of such competitively sensitive
and other restricted information only to antitrust counsel of the Receiving Party; provided that the Disclosing
Party also provides to the Receiving Party upon request of the Receiving Party a redacted version of such
information which does not contain any such competitively sensitive or other restricted information.
(d) If, prior to the Effective Time, a merger control inquiry is initiated by a Governmental Entity in the
jurisdictions set forth in Section 5.03(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, approval in that jurisdiction, or
confirmation that the inquiry has ended, will be deemed a condition precedent to the completion of the Merger
under Section 6.01(a).

systems in the case of employees) all amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.04(a) to the former holders of
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance Stock Units, as
applicable; provided, however, that, to the extent any such amounts relate to a Company Stock Option,
Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance Stock Unit that constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such amounts shall be paid at the earliest time following the
Effective Time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement or Company Stock Plan relating to such

(including obtaining any resolutions of the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee designated
thereby) to provide that (i) no new offering or new purchase period will commence following the date hereof
unless and until this Agreement is terminated; (ii) from and after the date hereof, no new participants will be
permitted to participate in the Company ESPP and participants will not be permitted to increase their payroll
deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (iii) the Company ESPP
shall terminate effective no later than ten (10) business days prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
determine the rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to the offering period underway under the
Company ESPP as of the date hereof by treating a business day to be determined by the Company as the last
day of such offering period (the “Final Investment Date”), which business day shall be no later than either (i)
the date on which such offering period would expire by its terms or (ii) the date on which the Company ESPP is
terminated, and by treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for

Period”), Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each individual who is employed by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Company
Employee”) for so long as such individual remains so employed, (i) annual base salary or base wage and target cash
incentive opportunities that are each no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Company Employee
by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) long-term incentive
opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided by Parent or its affiliates to similarly situated employees,
(iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Company Employee by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) other employee benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Company Employee by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Continuation Period,
the Continuing Company Employees shall be
A-32TABLE OF CONTENTS
entitled to participate in the plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates (the “Surviving
Corporation Plans”) to the same extent as other similarly situated employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective affiliates. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section
5.05(d), each Continuing Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all Surviving Corporation Plans to the extent coverage under any such plan replaces coverage under a
comparable benefit plan in which such Continuing Company Employee participates immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Nothing in this Section 5.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
Continuing Company Employee to employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
(b) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Transactions constitutes a “change in control”
or a “change of control” (or a term of similar import) for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan that contains a
definition of “change in control” or “change of control” (or a term of similar import), as applicable.
(c) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any “employee benefit plan”, as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time off and
severance plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting,
each Continuing Company Employee’s service with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service
with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to

any purpose under any pension or retirement plan, postretirement welfare plan or any plan under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its affiliates do not receive credit for prior service or that is grandfathered or
frozen. In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit each Continuing Company
Employee with paid time off equal to the paid time off such Continuing Company Employee had accrued with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that was unused immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which any Continuing
Company Employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions and waiting periods and
actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied
or did not apply to such employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare
Company Benefit Plan in which such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
provide Continuing Company Employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-
pocket maximum requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.
(e) Annual incentives for fiscal year 2022 shall be treated in accordance with Section 5.05 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.
(f) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no
Continuing Company Employee or any other Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section
9.07), and no provision of this Section 5.04 shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect of any
benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan or any employee program
or any plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or understanding of

respect to the obligations under the Company Credit Agreement (the “Payoff Letter”), in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the agent under the Company Credit Agreement, which Payoff
Letter and executed related release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount and
provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection with the Company Credit Agreement relating
to the assets, rights and properties of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness
shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the Payoff Letter at or prior to the Effective Time, be released
and terminated. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall this Section 5.06(a) require
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to cause the Company Credit Agreement Termination to be
effective unless and until the Effective Time has occurred and Parent has provided or caused to be provided to
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries funds (or Parent has directed the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to use funds on their balance sheet) to pay in full the then-outstanding principal amount
of and accrued and unpaid interest and fees under the Company Credit Agreement.
(b) Within the time periods required by the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, take all actions reasonably requested by Parent required by the
Convertible Notes Indenture and applicable Law to be performed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
at or prior to the Effective Time as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions, including the giving of any notices that may be required and delivery to the trustee, holders
or other applicable Person, as applicable, of any documents or instruments required to be delivered at or prior to
the Effective Time to such trustee, holders or other applicable Person, in each case in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Transactions or as otherwise required by the Convertible Notes
Indenture; provided that the Company (or the applicable Company Subsidiary) shall deliver a copy of any such
notice or other document to Parent at least three (3) business days prior to delivering or entering into such
notice or other document in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture and shall consider
Parent’s comments thereto in good faith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company agrees to cooperate with Parent, at Parent’s written request, by (i) executing and delivering
(or causing to be executed and delivered, as applicable) at the Effective Time, as applicable, one or more
supplemental indentures, officer’s certificates and opinions of counsel, in each case in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture and (ii) using its reasonable best
efforts to cause the trustee under the Convertible Notes Indenture to execute at the Effective Time any such
supplemental indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall be required to execute and deliver any document, certificate or instrument pursuant to this Section 5.06(b)
(or cause any such document, certificate or instrument to be executed or delivered) that is not conditioned on or
delivered prior to or substantially concurrently with the occurrence of the Effective Time.
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to its efforts to settle the
Capped Call Transactions (which settlement shall occur no earlier than the Effective Time) and the negotiation of
any termination or settlement payment or valuation related thereto; provided that nothing in this Section 5.06(c)
shall require the Company to (A) pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any payment
in connection with any Capped Call Transaction prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time, (B) enter into or
effect any settlement, termination, instrument or agreement, or agree to any settlement, termination or any other
change or modification to any instrument or agreement, that is effective prior to the occurrence of the Effective
Time or (C) refrain from delivering, or delay the delivery of, any notice required by the terms of the Capped Call

thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for the period beginning as of the Effective Time and ending six years from
the Effective Time. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing
obligations.
(b) Without limiting Section 5.07(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
agreement, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i)

respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the Transactions, and in each case pertaining to matters
pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether in any case asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall,
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified
Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of appropriate undertakings in favor of Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Section 5.07(b)), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection
with any such threatened or actual Proceeding. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall at their own expense
cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek
indemnification hereunder. Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under this Section 5.07(b) shall
continue in full force and effect for the period beginning as of the Effective Time and ending six years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions) for the period beginning as of the Effective Time and ending six years from the Effective Time,
covering each Indemnified Party and containing terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts) and
conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are in the aggregate no less favorable to
any Indemnified Party than those of the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in effect
on the date of this Agreement (the “Existing D&O Policies”); provided, however, that the maximum aggregate
annual premium for such “tail” insurance policies for any such year shall not exceed the maximum aggregate
annual premium contemplated by the second succeeding sentence. If such “tail” insurance policies have been
obtained by the Company, Parent shall cause such “tail” insurance policies to be maintained in full force and
effect, for their full term (but in any event shall not be required to cause such policies to be maintained for any
period more than six years from the Effective

Time), and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. In the event the
Company does not obtain such “tail” insurance policies, then, Parent shall either purchase such “tail” insurance
policies or, for the period beginning as of the Effective Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, cause
the Existing D&O Policies to be maintained in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time); provided, however, that, in any
case, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for
such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium payable by the Company for coverage for its
current fiscal year under the Existing D&O Policies; provided further that if the aggregate annual premium of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most
advantageous policy (as determined in Parent’s good faith discretion) available for an aggregate annual premium
not exceeding such amount; and provided further that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing terms (including with
respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that
are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party.
(d) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(A) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties
and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving

successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.07.
(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.07 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.07 applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 5.07 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her

Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.
(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys’
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other

Proposal are consummated or (2) the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate the

Takeover Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 4.02(h), except that all
references to 20% in such definition shall be deemed references to 50%. Any fee due under this Section

Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or
at different times and the occurrence of different events.

validity of any termination of this Agreement under Section 7.01(f). Except in the case of actual and intentional
fraud or the willful and material breach by the Company of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in
this Agreement, (x) payment of the Company Termination Fee described in this Section 5.08 shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and

further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. If the Company
fails to promptly make any payment required in accordance with this Section 5.08(c) and Parent commences a

respect of, pursuant to or arises under any Antitrust Law or such Law is an Antitrust Law)) and the conditions
set forth in Section 6.02 have been satisfied (or, in the case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of such termination), then
Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $326,000,000 (the “Reverse Termination Fee”), provided, however, that
no Reverse Termination Fee shall be payable by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.08(d) if the applicable Legal
Restraint that gives rise to the termination right pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii) or the failure of any of the

would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other
appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 8.10(b), without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy (and each party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific enforcement shall include the right of the Company
to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
such right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings
any Proceeding, in each case in accordance with Section 8.10(b), to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time
during which such Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) business days or (ii) such other time period established
by the court presiding over such Proceeding, as the case may be.

of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable, any state or federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware) for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other Transactions, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such
Proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in such court. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall
be unavailable, any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) in the event any Proceeding arises out
of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by U.S. registered mail to such party’s
respective address set forth in Section 8.02 (provided that nothing in this Section 8.10(b) shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law) and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any
Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable, any state or federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware). The parties hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party’s rights to seek any
post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.
