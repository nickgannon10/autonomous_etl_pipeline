Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Vonage will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of

10Table of Contents
pay Vonage a termination fee of $200,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances in connection with a failure to

VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Appraisal Rights (see page 99),"Appraisal Rights (see page 99)
Under Delaware law, holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger, provided that
such holders comply with the applicable requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock who
properly seeks appraisal and complies with the applicable requirements under Delaware law (“Dissenting Stockholders”) will forego the Merger
Consideration and instead receive a cash payment equal to the fair value of his, her or its shares of Vonage Common Stock in connection with the
Merger. Fair value will be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery following an appraisal proceeding. Dissenting Stockholders will not know
the appraised fair value at the time such holders must elect whether to seek appraisal. The ultimate amount Dissenting Stockholders receive in an
appraisal proceeding may be more or less than, or the same as, the amount such holders would have received under the Merger Agreement if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares of Vonage Common Stock.
To seek appraisal, a Vonage stockholder of record must (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal to Vonage before the vote on the adoption of
the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, (ii) not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (iii) continuously hold the
shares of Vonage Common Stock through the Effective Time, and (iv) otherwise comply with the applicable requirements and procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to strictly follow the requirements and procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of
appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of shares of Vonage Common Stock
unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by Vonage’s stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal
rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the
DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of
common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or
other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other
nominee. For more information, please see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 99.

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Vonage Common Stock pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 64) who receives cash in exchange for shares of Vonage Common Stock in the Merger will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Vonage
Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Vonage
Common Stock (that is, shares of Vonage Common Stock acquired for the same cost in a single transaction). In addition, under certain circumstances,
we may be required to withhold a portion of your Merger Consideration under applicable tax laws. You should refer to the discussion in the section
entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 64, and consult your tax advisor with
respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the Merger.

Q:

deduction for any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Vonage Common Stock you own as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger. For further information, see the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Merger Consideration and Effect of the Merger
on Certain Securities,” beginning on page 69.
 
Q:
When and where will the Special Meeting of stockholders be held?

Q:
What proposals will be considered at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:
 
 
•
 The Merger Agreement Proposal. A proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
 
 
•
 The Non-Binding Advisory Compensation Proposal. A proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may
be paid or become payable to Vonage’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and other Transactions,
as discussed in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 54; and
 
 
•
 The Adjournment Proposal. A proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to
approve the Merger.
 
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
Only holders of record of Vonage Common Stock as of the close of business on January 5, 2022, the Record Date, are entitled to notice of and to

13Table of Contents
Q:
What shares of Vonage Common Stock can I vote?
 
A:
Each share of Vonage Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to vote on all items being
voted on at the Special Meeting. You may vote all shares of Vonage Common Stock owned by you as of the Record Date, including (1) shares of
Vonage Common Stock held directly in your name as the stockholder of record and (2) shares of Vonage Common Stock held for you as the
beneficial owner in street name through a broker, trustee or other nominee, such as a bank. On the Record Date, we had 254,037,958 shares of
Vonage Common Stock issued and outstanding.
 
Q.
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on the Company?
 
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement Proposal is
approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company, with the Company becoming an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, the Company will
cease to be a public company and you will cease to hold Vonage Common Stock or have any interest in the Company’s future earnings or growth.
In addition, following the Merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no
longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
 
Q:
What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger?
 
A:
The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Vonage Common Stock pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder (as defined below in the section entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 64) who receives cash in exchange for shares of Vonage Common Stock in the Merger will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the cash received and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Vonage
Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Vonage
Common Stock (that is, shares of Vonage Common Stock acquired for the same cost in a single transaction).
Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally
will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of Vonage Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such
Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and
foreign tax consequences of the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances (including with respect to any tax consequences to holders or
beneficial owners of options or other equity awards participating in the Merger or Transactions with respect to such options or equity awards) and
any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided below under the section entitled “The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 64.
 
Q:

A:
For information regarding the treatment of outstanding Vonage Equity Awards, see the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—
Treatment of Equity Awards,” beginning on page 70.
 
14
Table of Contents
Q:
What vote is required to approve each of the proposals?
 
A:
The Merger Agreement Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock
entitled to vote on such matter. Abstentions, failures to vote and “broker non-votes” will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger
Agreement Proposal.
The approval of the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Vonage Common Stock
present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter. Although the Board intends to consider the vote resulting
from this proposal, the vote is advisory only and, therefore, is not binding on Vonage or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the
Merger Agreement is adopted by Vonage stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger will be payable to our named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved. Failures to vote and broker non-votes will have no
effect on approval of the proposal; however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock present or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the
affirmative vote of shares of Vonage Common Stock representing a majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock present or represented by proxy
at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time. In each case, failures to vote and
broker non-votes will have no effect on approval of the proposal; however, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal.
 
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
 
A:
Upon careful consideration, the Board has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are in
the best interests of Vonage and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the
Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal, and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
For a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement, please see the
section entitled “The Merger—Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 40. In addition, in
considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and executive
officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Vonage stockholders generally. See the section entitled “The
Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 54.
 
Q:
Do I need to attend the virtual Special Meeting?
 
A:
No. It is not necessary for you to attend the Special Meeting in order to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock. If you are a stockholder of
record as of the Record Date, you may vote by mail, by telephone or through the Internet, as described in more detail below. If you are a “street
name” holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock, you must follow the voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other
nominee for your shares of Vonage Common Stock to be voted at the Special Meeting, as described in more detail below.
 
Q:
How many shares of Vonage Common Stock need to be represented at the Special Meeting?
 
A:
The presence at the Special Meeting, by attendance via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Vonage
Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering the proposals. As of the Record
Date, there were 254,037,958
 
15
Table of Contents
 
shares of Vonage Common Stock outstanding. If you are a Vonage stockholder as of the close of business on the Record Date and you vote by
mail, by telephone, through the Internet or at the Special Meeting via the virtual meeting website, you will be considered part of the quorum. If you
are a “street name” holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock and you provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions,
then your shares of Vonage Common Stock will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of
Vonage Common Stock and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares of Vonage
Common Stock will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.
All shares of Vonage Common Stock held by stockholders that attend the Special Meeting via the virtual meeting website, or represented by proxy,
and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, regardless of how such shares of Vonage Common Stock are voted or whether such stockholders have
indicated on their proxy that they are abstaining from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum,
the Special Meeting may be adjourned.
 
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Vonage’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?
 
A:
In July 2010, the SEC adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid
or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the Merger. In
accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Vonage is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a
non-binding advisory vote on compensation that may be paid or become payable to Vonage’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. For additional information, see the section entitled “Proposal 2: Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal,” beginning on page 30.
 
Q:
What will happen if Vonage stockholders do not approve the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal?
 
A:
The vote to approve the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Approval of the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and it is advisory in nature only,
meaning that it will not be binding on Vonage or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by
Vonage’s stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our
named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.
 
Q:
What do I need to do now?
 
A:
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the Annexes attached to this proxy statement, please
vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible. You will be entitled to one vote for each share
of Vonage Common Stock that you owned on the Record Date.
 
Q:
How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?
 
A:
You may vote by:
 
 
•
 submitting your proxy by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it by mail in the enclosed prepaid
envelope;
 
 
•
 submitting your proxy by using the telephone number printed on each proxy card you receive;
 
16
Table of Contents
 
•
 submitting your proxy through the Internet voting instructions printed on each proxy card you receive; or
 
 
•
 casting your vote at the Special Meeting via the virtual meeting website. Any stockholder can attend the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/VG2022SM, where stockholders will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote online. The Special
Meeting starts at 10:00 A.M., Eastern Time. Please have your control number to join the Special Meeting. Instructions on how to attend and
participate online are also posted online at www.proxyvote.com.
If you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on the
day before the Special Meeting.
Submitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet will not prevent you from voting at the Special Meeting. You are encouraged
to submit a proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting to ensure that your shares of Vonage
Common Stock are represented at the Special Meeting.
If you return your signed proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares of Vonage Common Stock will be
voted “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal, and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
 
Q:
If my shares of Vonage Common Stock are held for me by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, will my bank, broker, trust or other nominee
vote those shares of Vonage Common Stock for me with respect to the proposals?
 
A:
Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock at the Special Meeting unless you
provide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on
how to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock with respect to the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or
other nominee. You may be able to vote by telephone or through the Internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.
 
Q:
What if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?
 
A:
Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock unless you have properly instructed your
bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the Merger Agreement Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote on such matter, the failure to provide your nominee with voting instructions
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal. Furthermore, your shares of Vonage Common Stock will not be
included in the calculation of the number of shares of Vonage Common Stock present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a
quorum is present.
 
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have submitted my proxy by telephone or through the Internet?
 
A:
Yes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting. You may revoke your proxy by delivering
a signed written notice of revocation stating that the proxy is revoked and bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to Vonage’s Corporate
Secretary at 23 Main Street, Holmdel, NJ 07733. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by submitting another proxy by telephone or
through the Internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. You may also submit a later-dated proxy card relating to the
same shares of Vonage Common Stock. If you voted by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should retain a
copy of the voter control number found on the proxy card in the event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or
 
17
Table of Contents
 
change your vote by telephone or through the Internet. Alternatively, your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the Special Meeting and
voting via the virtual meeting website. However, simply attending the Special Meeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy. “Street
name” holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to
revoke or change their proxies.
If you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock, you must follow the instructions
received from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your vote.
All properly submitted proxies received by us before the Special Meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being exercised at the Special
Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions were provided,
“FOR” each of the proposals.
 
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
 
A:
If you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of Vonage Common Stock that are registered in more than one account. For
example, if you own your shares of Vonage Common Stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as
custodian for a minor, you will receive, and you will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Vonage Common Stock
because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of Vonage Common Stock are voted, you
will need to submit your proxies by mailing in each proxy card you receive or by telephone or through the Internet by using the different voter
control number(s) on each proxy card.
 
Q:
What is “householding” and how does it affect me?
 
A:
The SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two or more stockholders reside,
unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the Company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases,
each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. This householding process reduces the volume of duplicate
information and reduces printing and mailing expenses. We have not instituted householding for stockholders of record; however, certain
brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of Vonage Common Stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has
multiple accounts holding Vonage Common Stock, you may have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your
broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate
copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and
thereby receive multiple copies.
 
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Vonage Common Stock before the Special Meeting?
 
A:
The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the expected date of the Merger. If you own shares of Vonage Common Stock as of the close
of business on the Record Date but transfer your shares of Vonage Common Stock prior to the Special Meeting, you will retain your right to vote at
the Special Meeting, but the right to receive $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock, in cash, net of any applicable withholding taxes and
without interest will pass to the person who holds your shares of Vonage Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 
Q:
May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?
 
A:
Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements and procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under
Delaware law, holders of record of Vonage Common Stock who do not
 
18
Table of Contents
 
vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Vonage Common Stock as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed. Appraisal rights only will be available to these holders if they deliver a
written demand for an appraisal to Vonage prior to the vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting and they comply with the
procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be
more than, the same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. A copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement. For additional information, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights,”
beginning on page 99.
 
Q:
If I hold my shares of Vonage Common Stock in certificated form, should I send in my Certificates now?
 
A:
No. Shortly after the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal that includes detailed written instructions on how to return your
Certificates. You must return your Certificates in accordance with such instructions in order to receive the Merger Consideration. PLEASE DO
NOT SEND IN YOUR CERTIFICATE(S) NOW.
 
Q:
Should I send in my Company Options, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Restricted Stock Units now?
 
A:
No. Shortly after the Merger is completed, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, your Company Options, Restricted Stock Units, and
Performance Restricted Stock Units will either be automatically exchanged for the applicable consideration, or you will receive further instructions
for such exchange. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Treatment of Equity Awards,”
beginning on page 70.
 
Q:
When is the Merger expected to be completed?
 
A:
We and Parent are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed during
the first half of 2022, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived. The
Merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived), including the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by Vonage stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. For additional information, see the section entitled “The
Agreement and Plan of Merger—Conditions to the Merger,” beginning on page 92.
 
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 
A:
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote
on the matter or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for your
shares of Vonage Common Stock. Instead, Vonage will remain a public company, and Vonage Common Stock will continue to be registered under the
Exchange Act and listed and traded on NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our business in a manner similar to that in which it is
being operated today and that holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which
they are currently subject with respect to their ownership of Vonage Common Stock. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed,
we may be obligated to pay Parent a termination fee.
For additional information, see the section entitled “The Merger—Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed,” beginning on page 64.

Each holder of record of shares of Vonage Common Stock as of the close of business on January 5, 2022, which is the Record Date, is entitled to
receive notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting. You will be entitled to one vote for each share of Vonage Common Stock that you owned on the
Record Date. As of the Record Date, there were 254,037,958 shares of Vonage Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, in person virtually via the virtual meeting website or by proxy, of the holders of 127,018,980 shares of
Vonage Common Stock (a majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote) constitutes a quorum for the
Special Meeting.
 
24Table of Contents
If you are a Vonage stockholder of record and you vote by mail, by telephone or through the Internet at the Special Meeting, then your shares of
Vonage Common Stock will be counted as part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock and you provide your
bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares of Vonage Common Stock will be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with
voting instructions, then your shares of Vonage Common Stock will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.
All shares of Vonage Common Stock held by stockholders of record that are present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting, regardless of how such shares of Vonage Common Stock are voted or whether such stockholders abstain from voting, will be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the Special Meeting may be adjourned.

Merger Agreement Proposal. The Merger Agreement Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote on such matter.
Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal. The approval of the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of shares of Vonage Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter. The vote is
advisory only and, therefore, is not binding on Vonage or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by
Vonage stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our named
executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.

The approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Vonage
Common Stock entitled to vote on such matter. Therefore, the failure to vote, the abstention from voting or “broker non-votes” will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.
The approval of the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal requires the affirmative vote of shares of Vonage Common Stock representing a
majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter. Consequently,
failures to vote and broker non-votes will have no effect on approval of the proposal. However, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal.

The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock present or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such matter, even if a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting. Consequently,
failures to vote and broker non-votes will have no effect on approval of the proposal. However, the abstention from voting will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. A bank, broker, trust or other nominee
may exercise discretion in voting on routine matters, but may not exercise discretion, and therefore will not vote on non-routine matters, if instructions are
not given. Accordingly, if your shares of Vonage Common Stock are held in “street name,” a bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote
your shares of Vonage Common Stock (referred to as a “broker non-vote”), and your shares of Vonage Common Stock will not be counted in determining
the presence of a quorum unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Because the Merger Agreement
Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote on such proposal, the failure to
provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement
Proposal. Because the approval of each of (i) the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal and (ii) the Adjournment Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on such
matter, and because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to provide your
bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of that proposal.",33,34

Stockholders have a choice of voting by proxy by completing a proxy card and mailing it in the prepaid envelope provided, or by calling a toll-free
telephone number or through the Internet. Please refer to your proxy card or the information forwarded by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to see
which options are available to you. The telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on the day
before the Special Meeting.
If you submit your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet voting procedures, but do not include “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN”
on a proposal to be voted, your shares of Vonage Common Stock will be voted in favor of that proposal. If you indicate “ABSTAIN” on a proposal to be
voted, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” that proposal. If you wish to vote by proxy and your shares of Vonage Common Stock are held by
a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you must follow the voting instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. Unless
you give your bank, broker, trust or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock, your bank, broker, trust or other
nominee will not be able to vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock on the proposals.
If you do not submit a proxy or otherwise vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock in any of the ways described above, it will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, but will have no effect on the approval of the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory
Proposal or the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our stockholders the opportunity to cast a vote to approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Vonage’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates
to the Merger, as disclosed in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation,” beginning on page 61, including the table entitled “Golden Parachute Payment” and accompanying footnotes. Accordingly, Vonage
stockholders are being provided with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on such payments.
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon Vonage or the Board, and approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the
Merger. Because the Merger-related executive compensation to be paid in connection with the Merger is based on the terms of the Merger Agreement as
well as the contractual arrangements between Vonage and the named executive officers, such compensation will be payable, regardless of the outcome of
this advisory vote, if the Merger Agreement is adopted (subject only to the contractual conditions applicable thereto). However, Vonage seeks your
support and believes that your support is appropriate because Vonage has a comprehensive executive compensation program designed to link the
compensation of its executives with Vonage’s performance and the interests of Vonage’s stockholders. Accordingly, you are asked to vote on the
following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Vonage Holdings Corp. approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the named executive officers of Vonage Holdings Corp. that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation,” beginning on page 61 (which disclosure includes the Golden Parachute Compensation Table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K).” 
The Board unanimously recommends that Vonage stockholders vote “FOR” the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal.
If you return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate instructions on your proxy card, your shares of Vonage Common Stock
represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal.
The approval of the Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal requires the affirmative vote of shares of Vonage Common Stock representing a
majority of the shares of Vonage Common Stock present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting that are entitled to vote on such matter.
The vote is advisory only and, therefore, not binding on Vonage or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the Merger Agreement is
adopted by Vonage’s stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to
our named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.

Vonage is seeking the adoption by Vonage stockholders of the Merger Agreement Vonage entered into on November 22, 2021 with Parent and
Merger Sub. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into

Upon completion of the Merger, each share of Vonage Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other

Background of the Merger",40,40
VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Board, together with the Company’s management and the assistance of the Company’s advisors, regularly reviews and assesses the
Company’s strategic direction, financial performance and business plans with a view towards strengthening the Company’s business and identifying
opportunities to increase stockholder value, taking into account financial, industry, competitive and other considerations. As part of this periodic review
and assessment, from time to time during the two-year period prior to the contacts and process resulting in the Company’s entry into the Merger
Agreement described below, the Board and the Company’s management considered potential strategic alternatives, including strategic acquisitions and
divestitures, and engaged in business development and strategic discussions with other participants in the industry in order to complement and expand
the Company’s existing business and operations. None of these prior discussions progressed beyond preliminary phases, including with respect to the
Company’s previously announced plans in February 2020 to explore the sale of its Consumer business segment (which plans were subsequently
terminated in February 2021), other than as described below.
In connection with the foregoing, on February 11, 2021, the Board approved the formation of a transactions committee (the “Transactions
Committee”), to be comprised of three independent members of the Board (Jeffrey Citron, the Chairman of the Board, Hamid Akhavan and Michael
McConnell), to assist the Board in its oversight of the Company’s transaction strategies and to review, assess and recommend transactions proposed by
the Company’s management in connection with the Company’s growth plan.
On May 6, 2021, a consortium comprised of two financial sponsors (together, “Party A”) delivered to Mr. Citron and Rory Read, the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company, an unsolicited proposal for the acquisition of the Company at a price of $16.25 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash (the
“Party A Proposal”), which proposal was based solely on publicly available information about the Company and was subject to Party A’s further due
diligence. Representatives of the Company previously had engaged in discussions with representatives of one member of Party A in connection with the
Company’s prior exploration of a sale of its Consumer business segment, and subsequently regarding business development and strategic opportunities
that were unrelated to the acquisition of the Company. None of these prior discussions progressed beyond preliminary phases.
On May 7, 2021, a representative of the Company contacted a representative of Qatalyst Partners LP (“Qatalyst Partners”) to discuss the Company
engaging Qatalyst Partners as its financial advisor in connection with the Party A Proposal.
On May 15, 2021, the Board held a meeting, attended by the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil, Gotshal &
Manges LLP (“Weil”), legal counsel to the Company, to review and
 
32Table of Contents
discuss the Party A Proposal. Representatives of Weil reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties as directors generally and in
connection with their review of the Party A Proposal. Following discussion, the Board determined that the Company should conduct further analyses,
with the assistance of its advisors, to assist the Board in reviewing and determining a course of action in connection with the Party A Proposal. The
Board, based on Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation, and its knowledge of the Company’s business and the industry in which the
Company operates, directed the Company’s management to retain Qatalyst Partners as the Company’s financial advisor (subject to negotiating an
acceptable engagement letter) and instructed Qatalyst Partners to prepare preliminary financial analyses of the Party A Proposal and of the Company’s
standalone value, for review with the Board at a meeting to be scheduled at a later date.
On May 16, 2021, a representative of the Company contacted Party A to convey that the Board was working to retain a financial advisor and that it
was evaluating the Party A Proposal.
On May 17, 2021, JANA Partners, LLC (“JANA”) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 13F reflecting an ownership in the
Company of 5,803,478 shares of Vonage Common Stock as of March 31, 2021, constituting approximately 2.3% of the then-outstanding shares of Vonage
Common Stock. On the same day, the media reported that JANA had acquired such ownership, that it believed the Company to be undervalued and
intended to advocate for changes at the Company.
On May 27, 2021, the Company entered into an engagement letter with Qatalyst Partners formalizing the engagement of Qatalyst Partners to act as
the Company’s financial advisor to, among other things, assist the Company in evaluating strategic alternatives for the Company, including a possible
sale of the Company.
In May 2021 and June 2021, the Transactions Committee and the Board held numerous meetings to discuss the Party A Proposal, at certain of
which members of the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil participated.
On June 7, 2021, the Board held a meeting, attended by the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil, at which,
among other things, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board certain preliminary financial considerations with respect to the Party A
Proposal. The Board discussed various strategic alternatives that might be available to the Company, including continuing as a standalone public
company and pursuing a growth acquisition strategy, a divestiture or spin-off of certain businesses of the Company, a sale of the Company to Party A,
following negotiation of the Party A Proposal, and a sale of the Company to another buyer through a formal sale process. Following discussion, the
Board determined that it would review and discuss in further detail at its next meeting the preliminary financial analyses presented by Qatalyst Partners,
as well as the various strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company.
On June 13, 2021, the Board held a meeting, attended by the Company’s management and representatives of Weil, at which, among other things, the
Board and its advisors discussed a potential response to Party A in connection with the Party A Proposal. Following discussion, the Board determined
that, based on the Company’s prospects and financial performance, the analyses presented by the Company’s management and its advisors and the
Board’s discussions to date, it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders not to accept the Party A Proposal. The Board also
determined that the Company should continue to engage with Party A and directed Qatalyst Partners to inform Party A that it would consider an offer
price above $20.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock and would allow Party A to engage in further due diligence with respect to a potential transaction.
On June 14, 2021, the Company sent Party A a letter responding to the Party A Proposal, noting that the Board had determined that the Company
would continue to operate as a stand-alone company and execute on its current strategy and growth plan.
On June 15, 2021, Qatalyst Partners advised Party A that the Board would be willing to engage with Party A with respect to a potential transaction if
Party A would consider increasing its offer price above $20.00 per share

of Vonage Common Stock. Party A expressed openness to increasing its offer price, subject to receipt of additional information, particularly regarding the
Company’s Application Program Interfaces (“API”) business and certain other financial and operational information about the Company, subject to the
parties entering into a confidentiality agreement.
On July 2, 2021, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party A, which included a customary standstill provision (which
standstill provision permitted Party A to make non-public proposals to the Company that would not require public disclosure).
On July 8, 2021, members of the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners met with representatives of Party A to review
certain financial, business and operational information about the Company.
On July 15, 2021, Party A advised Qatalyst Partners that it may be willing to increase its offer price by approximately $1.00 to $2.00 per share of
Vonage Common Stock (to a range of between approximately $17.00 to $18.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock) but that it would not increase its offer
above that range.
On July 21, 2021, the Transactions Committee held a regularly scheduled meeting attended by members of Company’s management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil, at which, among other things, the Transactions Committee and its advisors discussed the potential
increase in Party A’s offer. It was agreed that the Board should be updated on the potential increase in Party A’s offer at its next meeting.
On July 28, 2021, Mr. Read was contacted on an unsolicited basis by a financial sponsor (“Party B”) to discuss potential partnering and investment
opportunities with the Company, including a strategic transaction.
On July 29, 2021, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Weil, at which, among other things, representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board on the potential increase in Party A’s
offer to a range of between approximately $17.00 to $18.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock and Mr. Read updated the Board on the outreach by Party
B.
On August 6, 2021, the Company received an unsolicited non-binding proposal from a financial sponsor (“Party C”) for the acquisition of the
Company at a price of $18.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash (the “Party C Proposal”), which proposal was based solely on publicly
available information about the Company and was subject to Party C’s further due diligence.
On August 8, 2021, representatives of the Company’s management and Qatalyst Partners met to discuss the Party C Proposal and the feedback
provided by Party A regarding a potential increase to its offer price. Representatives of the Company directed Qatalyst Partners to instruct Party A that
its proposed potential increase to its offer price was still inadequate, and that while the Board remained open to considering an enhanced revised offer
from Party A above $20.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock, other parties had also expressed interest in a strategic transaction with the Company. On
August 9, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Party A to convey such message.
On August 15, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Party C and confirmed that the Board was reviewing the
Party C Proposal. Party C indicated that it planned to partner with two additional financial sponsors to help finance the Party C Proposal (hereinafter,
references to “Party C” shall refer collectively to the consortium of the three financial sponsors).
On August 16, 2021, JANA filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 13F reflecting that as of June 30, 2021, JANA had
increased its ownership in the Company from 5,803,478 shares of Vonage Common Stock to 9,835,964 shares of Vonage Common Stock, constituting
approximately 3.9% of the total then-outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock.

On August 26, 2021, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Weil, at which, among other things, the Board received an update from representatives of Qatalyst Partners on the Company’s recent trading performance
and preliminary valuation considerations, and discussed potential strategic alternatives in light of the two unsolicited proposals received from Party A
and Party C and the unsolicited inbound inquiry received from Party B. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best
interest of the Company and its stockholders to initiate a process to explore a potential sale of the Company. As part of this process, the Board authorized
Qatalyst Partners and the Company’s management to continue discussions with Party A, Party B and Party C and to contact other parties that might be
interested in a potential strategic transaction with the Company and able to provide an attractive offer price. The Board also directed Qatalyst Partners to
instruct Party C that while the Board was authorizing the Company to engage in further discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with Party
C once it had entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company, Party C would need to meaningfully improve its proposal for the Board to
consider a potential strategic transaction with Party C. The Board further directed Qatalyst Partners to instruct Party C that it could continue to do
additional due diligence on the Company, but there was interest from other parties in a potential strategic transaction with the Company.
On August 30, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with representatives of Party A and informed Party A that the Company had
received interest from other parties regarding a possible strategic transaction and that the Board had determined to solicit additional parties regarding a
possible strategic transaction with the Company and asked whether Party A was still interested in pursuing a potential transaction with the Company.
Representatives of Party A confirmed Party A’s continued interest in a potential transaction with the Company.
Also on August 30, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with representatives of Party C regarding the Party C Proposal to convey the
message provided by the Board at the prior meeting on August 26, 2021.
On August 31, 2021, the Company received a revised, unsolicited non-binding proposal from Party A for the acquisition of the Company at a price
of $18.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, subject to Party A conducting customary due diligence.
Also on August 31, 2021, Bloomberg published an article reporting that JANA was encouraging the Company to explore strategic alternatives,
including the sale of all or a portion of the Company’s business.
On September 1, 2021, the Transactions Committee met with the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Weil to
discuss the process to explore a potential sale of the Company. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Transactions Committee authorized Qatalyst
Partners to begin contacting parties, including Parent, that might be interested in a potential strategic transaction with the Company and able to provide
an attractive offer price. During the month of September 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, on behalf of the Company, conducted a broad
outreach to potential parties, which together with inbound contacts, resulted in Qatalyst Partners engaging with 30 parties, including Parent, regarding a
potential strategic transaction with the Company. Of the 30 parties, the Company signed confidentiality agreements with a total of 13 parties (including
one strategic party that already had a pre-existing confidentiality agreement related to such party’s commercial relationship with the Company), comprised
of four strategic companies (including Parent) and nine financial sponsors (including Party A, Party B and Party C), and each confidentiality agreement
(other than the pre-existing confidentiality agreement) included a customary standstill provision (which standstill provision permitted the counterparty to
make non-public proposals to the Company that would not require public disclosure). Other parties that Qatalyst Partners contacted declined to
participate in the process for a variety of reasons, including competing priorities, no interest in certain of the Company’s business segments, the financial
profile of certain of the Company’s business segments and/or overlap with existing businesses.
Each party that signed a confidentiality agreement was provided access to certain non-public materials regarding the Company’s business and
operations and a call with members of the Company’s management team.

Table of Contents
Between September 2021 and November 2021, members of the Company’s management team held management presentations and subsequent diligence
sessions with 13 parties, including Parent, at certain of which representatives of Qatalyst Partners participated.
On September 15, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Parent had an initial call regarding a potential strategic transaction with the
Company.
On September 21, 2021, Parent executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company, which included a customary standstill provision (which
On September 21, 2021, Parent executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company, which included a customary standstill provision (which
standstill provision permitted Parent to make non-public proposals to the Company that would not require public disclosure).
Beginning on September 22, 2021, the Company and Parent engaged in a due diligence process as part of which the Company shared certain non-
public information regarding the Company with Parent to assist with Parent’s evaluation and review of a potential transaction. During this process, the
Company’s management team and representatives of Parent, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (“Freshfields”), legal counsel to Parent, and
Goldman Sachs International (“Goldman”), financial advisor to Parent, held numerous due diligence meetings on subject areas such as finance, strategy,
product and technology, human resources, network, information technology, intellectual property, corporate, regulatory, tax, data privacy, real estate,
sanctions and compliance. Also during this period, Mr. Read and Mr. Borje Ekholm, the Chief Executive Officer of Parent, as well as other representatives
of the Company, Parent and their respective advisors, had various telephone conferences and meetings to discuss the potential transaction.
Between September 24, 2021 and October 5, 2021, six of the parties that signed confidentiality agreements and participated in management meetings
with the Company, including Party C, declined to proceed with a potential transaction with the Company for a variety of reasons, including the margin
profile of certain of the Company’s business segments, the Company’s technology and competitive landscape, competing priorities and/or no interest in
one or more of the Company’s business segments and the inability to justify valuation levels that would support a proposal consistent with expectations
viewed as adequate by the Board to move forward in the process.
On October 5, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners delivered a process letter to the seven remaining parties (comprised of two strategic
companies and five financial sponsors) that had signed confidentiality agreements and participated in management meetings with the Company, including
Parent, Party A and Party B, requesting that each party submit a non-binding written proposal with respect to a strategic transaction with the Company
no later than October 18, 2021.
On October 18, 2021, representatives of each of Parent and Party A indicated to Qatalyst Partners that they would be submitting non-binding
proposals but would need an additional day.
On October 19, 2021, Parent submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire all of the shares of Vonage Common Stock for a purchase price of
between $20.50 to $22.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, subject to Parent’s confirmatory due diligence. Parent’s proposal represented a 52%
to 63% premium to the price per share of Vonage Common Stock as of August 30, 2021, the last closing price prior to the Bloomberg article discussed
above, of $13.50, and a 34% to 43% premium to the Company’s 52-week high price per share of Vonage Common Stock prior to August 30, 2021, of $15.35.
As part of its proposal, Parent indicated that at the appropriate time it would like to discuss with the Company’s management team and other key
employees post-closing employment opportunities and arrangements; such discussions did not commence until November 15, 2021, as discussed below.
In addition, Parent indicated in its proposal a readiness to work on an accelerated basis to announce a transaction as soon as possible.
Also on October 19, 2021, the Company received a written non-binding proposal from Party A to acquire the Company’s Consumer business
segment and UC/CC business segment (i.e., the Company’s business other
 
36
Table of Contents
than the API business segment) for aggregate consideration of between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in cash, subject to Party A’s confirmatory due diligence.
Party A’s proposal also stated that it would be willing to make a “meaningful” cash investment into the Company’s remaining business following such
proposed sale transaction (i.e., the API business segment).
Other than the proposals from Party A and Parent, the strategic review process did not result in any other proposals with respect to a strategic
transaction with the Company, including from Party B. The parties that declined to submit a proposal determined to do so for a variety of reasons,
including the margin profile of certain of the Company’s business segments, the Company’s technology and competitive landscape, competing priorities
and/or no interest in one or more of the Company’s business segments.
On October 20, 2021, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Weil, at which, among other things, the Board received an update on the process to explore strategic alternatives and representatives of Qatalyst Partners
reviewed with the Board a financial overview and preliminary valuation considerations with respect to the proposals from Parent and Party A,
respectively. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that (i) it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to prioritize
the evaluation of a potential transaction with Parent as compared to any other potential transaction, including the proposal from Party A, which the Board
found unattractive due to the inadequate valuation and the fact that the offer was for less than all of the Company, and (ii) to pursue a potential
transaction with Parent. As a result of this determination, the Board directed the Company’s management and its financial and legal advisors to proceed
with negotiations with Parent regarding a potential transaction.
On October 21, 2021, representatives of Qatalyst Partners, on behalf of the Company, contacted representatives of Goldman to inform them that the
Company would consider transacting at the top end of Parent’s indicated range of $20.50 to $22.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock if a definitive
agreement could be finalized expeditiously. Mr. Read also called Mr. Ekholm to convey the same message.
Later in the day on October 21, 2021, representatives of Weil sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of Freshfields.
From October 21, 2021 through November 21, 2021, representatives of the Company, Parent and their respective advisors, had various telephone
conferences and meetings to discuss Parent’s continued due diligence of the Company on the topics of, among other things, finance, strategy, product
and technology, human resources, network, information technology, intellectual property, corporate, regulatory, tax, data privacy, real estate, sanctions
and compliance, as well as the potential transaction in general. During such period, the Company’s management team periodically provided updates to
members of the Board regarding the potential transaction with Parent.
On October 27, 2021, representatives of Freshfields provided representatives of Weil with their initial comments to Weil’s draft of the Merger
Agreement. From October 27, 2021 through November 21, 2021, the Company, Parent and their respective legal advisors negotiated the Merger
Agreement and related transaction documents. Significant areas of discussion and negotiation included: (i) the level of conditionality in the Merger
Agreement, including with respect to domestic and foreign regulatory filings; (ii) the treatment and vesting of the Company’s equity awards; (iii)
regulatory efforts standards and the standard for possible divestitures or other remedies in connection with applicable antitrust and foreign investment
laws; (iv) the termination fees payable by the Company or Parent, as applicable, in certain circumstances; and (v) the scope of the representations and
warranties and covenants of the parties.
On October 29, 2021, a representative of Goldman Sachs called a representative of Qatalyst Partners to discuss the potential transaction and
indicated that Parent would potentially be in a position to provide an updated indication of price on November 8, 2021 or November 9, 2021.

On November 8, 2021, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had a telephone conversation with a representative of Parent during which Parent
stated that Parent would only be in a position to provide an updated indication of price after an upcoming Parent board meeting. On the same date, Mr.
Ekholm contacted Mr. Read to state Parent’s position that it would provide an updated indication of price after the upcoming Parent board meeting.
On November 9, 2021, Mr. Ekholm called Mr. Read and reaffirmed Parent’s position that it would provide an updated indication of price after the
upcoming Parent board meeting.
On November 11, 2021, Mr. Ekholm had a telephone conversation with Mr. Read during which he stated that Parent would offer to acquire all of the
shares of Vonage Common Stock for a purchase price of $20.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash. Mr. Read informed Mr. Ekholm that the Board
would need to consider the proposal; however, he indicated that it was likely that the proposal would be deemed inadequate by the Board considering
that it was below the purchase price range previously communicated by Parent and inconsistent with the guidance provided by the Company to Parent
previously. Later that day, Mr. Ekholm called Mr. Read and increased Parent’s offer to acquire all of the shares of Vonage Common Stock to $20.50 per
share of Vonage Common Stock in cash. Mr. Read reiterated that he believed the purchase price would still be deemed inadequate by the Board.
On November 12, 2021, Mr. Ekholm had another telephone conversation with Mr. Read during which he increased Parent’s offer to acquire all of the
shares of Vonage Common Stock to $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, which Mr. Ekholm indicated was the “best and final” offer from
Parent. Parent’s revised proposal represented a 56% premium to the price per share of Vonage Common Stock as of August 30, 2021, the last closing price
prior to the Bloomberg article discussed above, of $13.50, and a 37% premium to the Company’s 52-week high price per share of Vonage Common Stock
prior to August 30, 2021, of $15.35.
On November 13, 2021, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Weil, at which the Board received an update on the status of the potential transaction with Parent, including the negotiations and due diligence that had
occurred to date, and discussed Parent’s proposal to acquire all of the shares of Vonage Common Stock for $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in
cash. At the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board a financial overview of Parent’s revised proposal and representatives
of Weil reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties. After deliberations and discussions, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the
Company and its stockholders to continue negotiations with Parent and to submit a counter-proposal for $21.50 per share of Vonage Common Stock in
cash, but that ultimately the Board would be willing to accept a purchase price of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash and that the
Company’s management was authorized to proceed on that basis.
Following the Board meeting on November 13, 2021, Mr. Read spoke with Mr. Ekholm and conveyed the counter-proposal of $21.50 per share of
Vonage Common Stock in cash. Mr. Ekholm rejected the counter-offer and reiterated that $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash was Parent’s
“best and final” offer. Mr. Read subsequently agreed to the $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash purchase price, subject to approval by the
Board and satisfactory resolution of the remaining terms of the Merger Agreement, in particular with respect to the regulatory closing conditions and
termination fees.
On November 15, 2021, following confirmation by a representative of the Company’s management that Parent was authorized to have employment
discussions with Mr. Read, Mr. Ekholm contacted Mr. Read regarding his employment agreement with the Company and transaction-related benefits,
including equity awards. During the conversation, Mr. Ekholm requested that Mr. Read amend his employment agreement to, among other things, forego
his existing right to resign for “good reason” as a result of his no longer holding the position of Chief Executive Officer of a publicly traded company,
which would otherwise entitle him to severance payments under his existing employment agreement and accelerated vesting of his outstanding equity
awards.

During the time period between November 15, 2021 and November 17, 2021, Parent, Mr. Read and their respective counsel negotiated the terms of
Mr. Read’s post-transaction employment agreement with the Company, the terms of which would initially be memorialized in a letter agreement entered
into concurrently with the Merger Agreement.
On November 17, 2021, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Weil, at which the Board discussed the potential transaction with Parent. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board its financial
analyses of the merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon. Further, representatives of Weil
reviewed with the directors of the Board their fiduciary duties and the key terms of the Merger Agreement. Representatives of Weil then reviewed with
the Board the remaining contractual points in the Merger Agreement that were still open for negotiation with Parent, including with respect to the
regulatory closing conditions and termination fees. Representatives of Weil then reviewed with the Board the terms of Mr. Read’s post-transaction
employment agreement with the Company. Following the presentations by Qatalyst Partners and Weil, and after further discussing the potential
transaction with Parent, the Board approved the potential transaction with Parent, subject to resolution of the remaining open items in the Merger
Agreement and Mr. Read’s post-transaction employment agreement.
During the time period between November 17, 2021 and November 21, 2021, representatives of Weil and Freshfields finalized the terms of the
Merger Agreement and Mr. Read and Parent reached an agreement on Mr. Read’s post-transaction employment agreement with the Company (for more
information, please see below under the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Employment and
Related Agreements—Rory Read Letter Agreement”).
On November 21, 2021, the Board held a meeting attended by members of the Company’s management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
Weil, at which the Board discussed the potential transaction with Parent. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board its financial
analyses of the merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon. At the conclusion of its
presentation, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of November 21, 2021, and
based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such written opinion, the merger
consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the draft of the Merger Agreement, as of such date, by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of
Parent), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, please see below under the
section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP.” Further, representatives of Weil reviewed with the directors of the Board their fiduciary
duties and a summary of the key terms of the Merger Agreement, as of such date. Following the presentations by Qatalyst Partners and Weil, and after
further discussing Parent’s proposal, the Board discussed the potential reasons for and against the potential transaction (see below under the section
entitled “The Merger—Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement”). At the conclusion of the discussions, the Board
unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement (ii) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company’s stockholders, and
(iii) resolved to recommend to the Company’s stockholders the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
On November 22, 2021, the Company and Parent executed the Merger Agreement and Mr. Read and Parent executed a letter agreement regarding
Mr. Read’s post-transaction employment agreement with the Company. Early that morning, prior to the opening of trading of the Company’s common
stock on the NASDAQ, the Company and Parent issued press releases announcing the transaction and the execution of the Merger Agreement.

At a meeting of the Board on November 21, 2021, after careful consideration, including detailed discussions with Vonage’s management and its

Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement",48,48

In arriving at its unanimous determination and recommendation at the November 21, 2021 meeting (please see above under the section entitled “The
Merger—Recommendation of the Board”), the Board reviewed and discussed a significant amount of information and consulted with the Company’s
management, legal advisor and financial advisor. The following are some of the significant factors that supported its decision to approve the Merger
Agreement (not necessarily in order of relative importance) and the Transactions, including the Merger:
 
 
•
 Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The Board considered the fact that, the Merger Consideration is all cash, which provides the
Company’s stockholders immediate certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Vonage Common Stock and enables the Company’s
stockholders to realize value that has been created at the Company while eliminating long-term business and execution risk. Specifically,
among other things, the Board considered:
 
 
•
 The fact that the Merger Consideration represents a premium value for the Company’s stockholders, including:
 
 
•
 
a premium of 56% to the Company’s closing price per share of Vonage Common Stock on August 30, 2021 (the last trading
day prior to the Bloomberg article reporting that JANA was encouraging the Company to explore strategic alternatives) of
$13.50 per share of Vonage Common Stock, and a premium of 37% to the Company’s 52-week high closing price per share of
Vonage Common Stock prior to August 30, 2021 of $15.35 per share of Vonage Common Stock;
 
 
•
 
a premium of 28% to the Company’s closing price per share of Vonage Common Stock on November 19, 2021 (the last trading
day prior to the Board’s approval of the Merger Agreement) of $16.37 per share of Vonage Common Stock, and a premium of
34% to the volume-weighted average price per share of Vonage Common Stock over the three-month period ended
November 19, 2021 of $15.71 per share of Vonage Common Stock; and
 
 
•
 
a premium of 21% to the Company’s all-time high closing price per share of Vonage Common Stock on November 5, 2021 of
$17.35 per share of Vonage Common Stock.
 
 
•
 The trading history of the Company and the Merger Consideration relative to such history.
 
 
•
 The belief that the Merger Consideration represents the highest price that Parent was willing to pay considering the negotiations
between the parties.
 
 
40Table of Contents
 
•
 Prospects of the Company.
 
 
•
 The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration compares favorably to the potential long-term value of the Company if
the Company were to remain as a stand-alone entity after taking into account the risks and uncertainties associated with this
alternative, including the Company’s historical and projected business, competitive position within the industry and current market
and financial conditions.
 
 
•
 The Board considered the possibility of continuing to operate the Company as a stand-alone entity and the desirability and perceived
risks of continuing to execute on its business plan, the potential benefits to the Company’s stockholders of this alternative and the
time horizon required for the business plan to yield improved financial and market performance by the Company.
 
 
•
 The Board considered the Company’s standalone business plan, financial forecasts and the risks associated with the Company’s
ability to execute on and achieve such business plan and forecasts, including execution risks associated with implementing planned-
on initiatives across new partnerships and product introductions, sales efforts and business transformations.
 
 
•
 The Board considered the significant financial investments that would be required to execute on its business plan, including the
timing thereof.
 
 
•
 The Board considered the fact that pursuing a strategic process whereby the different business segments of the Company are sold in
separate transactions would not be reasonably likely to create greater value for the Company’s stockholders than the Merger after
taking into account (i) the Board’s view of the separate value of the businesses of the Company as compared to the value of the
combined Company, (ii) the execution risk, business, competitive, industry and market risk, tax implications and transaction costs
associated with pursuing such a process, and (iii) the substantial time and effort required of the Company’s management to complete
multiple sale transactions, which could divert management’s attention and resources from the operation of the Company’s business,
including other strategic opportunities and operational matters.
 
 
•
 The Board considered certain industry trends and the potential risks and volatility associated with these developments, including
companies increasing competition in the market.
 
 
•
 The Board considered the fact that certain investments in and acquisitions of unaffiliated third parties were contemplated as part of
the business plan and in that regard considered the potential of limited opportunities on financially attractive terms.
 
 
•
 The Sale Process:
 
 
•
 The Board considered that after receiving unsolicited indications of interest from three parties, the Board commenced a sale process
and, together with the assistance of Qatalyst Partners, communicated with 30 potential strategic and financial sponsor parties it
believed most likely and capable of acquiring the Company (as described above in “The Merger—Background of the Merger”).
 
 
•
 The Board considered that of the 30 parties contacted, 13 entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company (including one
party that already had a pre-existing confidentiality agreement).
 
 
•
 The Board considered that Parent’s offer of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock was the only final offer received to acquire the
entire Company at the conclusion of the Company’s process of exploring strategic alternatives.
 
 
•
 Negotiation Process. The Board considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were the
result of robust arm’s-length negotiations conducted by the Company, with the knowledge and at the direction of the Board, and with the
assistance of an independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel.

•
 Opinion of Financial Advisors. The Board considered the oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect
that, as of November 21, 2021, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in such
written opinion, the merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any
affiliate of Parent), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below under the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP,” which full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.
 
 
•
 Non-Price Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the non-price terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
 
 
•
 the provision allowing the Board to make a Change in Recommendation prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote in specified
circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, subject to Parent’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and
receive payment of a termination fee in the amount of $200 million;
 
 
•
 the provision allowing the Board to terminate the Merger Agreement to substantially concurrently enter into a definitive written
Alternative Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions (including certain rights of
Parent to match the Superior Proposal and the prior or concurrent payment to Parent of a termination fee of $200 million) if Parent is
unable to or declines to match the terms of a Superior Proposal;
 
 
•
 the provision requiring Parent to pay the Company a termination fee of $200 million, if the Company or Parent terminate the Merger
Agreement under specified circumstances in connection with a failure to obtain CFIUS Clearance;
 
 
•
 the absence of any financing condition to the consummation of the Merger;
 
 
•
 the fact that the Merger is not subject to approval of Parent’s stockholders;
 
 
•
 Parent’s obligation under the Merger Agreement to use its best efforts (as defined below in “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—
Efforts to Complete the Merger”) to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper
or advisable under the Merger Agreement and applicable laws and orders to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other Transactions as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date; provided, that Parent will not have
any obligation to propose, undertake or agree to any such actions if such actions would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate with all such other actions, result in a Substantial Detriment (as defined below in “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—
Efforts to Complete the Merger”); and
 
 
•
 the Company’s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement.
 
 
•
 Opportunity for the Company’s Stockholders to Vote. The Board considered the fact that the Merger would be subject to the approval of
the Company’s stockholders, and the Company’s stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against the adoption of
the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
 
 
•
 Timing of Completion. The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, and the
structure of the Merger and concluded that the Transactions, including the Merger, could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an
orderly manner. The Board also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period
during which the Company’s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.
 
 
42
Table of Contents
 
•
 Availability of Appraisal Rights. The Board considered the availability of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to the Company’s
stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who otherwise comply with all of the required
procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL, which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware determine the fair value of their shares of Vonage Common Stock, which may be more than, the same as or less than
the Merger Consideration.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Transactions,
including:
 
 
•
 No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Board considered the fact that the nature of the Merger as an all cash
transaction means that the Company would no longer exist as an independent public company following the consummation of the Merger
and that the Company’s stockholders will not participate in future earnings or growth of Parent and will not benefit from any appreciation in
value of the Surviving Corporation.
 
 
•
 Closing Conditions. The Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to
consummate the Merger will be satisfied even if the Merger Agreement is approved by the Company’s stockholders.
 
 
•
 Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The Board considered the possibility that the Transactions, including the Merger,
might not be consummated, and the fact that if the Merger is not consummated:
 
 
•
 the Company’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have
experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the Transactions;
 
 
•
 the Company will have incurred significant transaction costs;
 
 
•
 the Company’s continuing business relationships with customers, suppliers, business partners and employees may be adversely
affected;
 
 
•
 the trading price of shares of Vonage Common Stock could be materially and adversely affected; and
 
 
•
 the market’s perceptions of the Company’s prospects could be adversely affected.
 
 
•
 No Solicitation and Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement precludes
the Company from soliciting or entertaining alternative acquisition proposals and requires the Company to pay Parent a termination fee of
$200 million in certain circumstances, including if the Board terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
 
 
•
 Effects of Transaction Announcement. The Board considered the effect of the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, including
effects on the Company’s stock price, and the Company’s ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the
Transactions, as well as the potential for legal proceedings, judgments or settlements following the announcement of the Transactions and
the associated costs, burden and inconvenience involved in defending those proceedings, judgments and settlements.
 
 
•
 Timing Risks. The Board considered the amount of time it could take to complete the Merger, including that completion of the Merger
depends on factors outside of the Company’s or Parent’s control (including the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s
stockholders), and the risk that the pendency of the Merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of the execution of
the Merger Agreement could divert the Company’s management’s attention and have an adverse impact on the Company, including its
customer, supplier and other business relationships.
 
43
Table of Contents
 
•
 Taxable Consideration. The Board considered the fact that the exchange of Vonage Common Stock for cash in the Merger generally will be
a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
 
•
 Other Risks. The Board considered the other risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, see “Risk Factors” in
our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 incorporated by reference herein and the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
In addition to considering the factors described above, the Board also considered that some of the Company’s directors and executive officers
have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests
and considered them at the time it approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to the Company’s stockholders. See the section
entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual
directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what
extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board based its recommendation on
the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above.

VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Certain Financial Projections Utilized in Connection with the Merger,"Certain Financial Projections Utilized in Connection with the Merger
In the course of due diligence, Vonage provided Parent in September 2021 with non-public financial information relating to Vonage, including certain
internal financial forecasts, estimates and other financial and operating data relating to Vonage prepared in the ordinary course by the management of
Vonage for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 only (and excluding the Non-GAAP Operating Income, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow—
Consumer forecasts set forth below). In November 2021, Vonage management updated these internal financial forecasts: (i) to reflect Vonage’s actual third
quarter 2021 performance and (ii) to extrapolate them through fiscal year 2026, which updated forecasts are referred to herein as the “Forecasts,” and
such Forecasts were made available to the Board for use in its evaluation of the Merger and also were provided to Qatalyst Partners which was directed
to use and rely upon the Forecasts for purposes of its financial analyses and opinion as described in the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of
Qatalyst Partners LP,” beginning on page 47, but which were not provided to Parent prior to entering into the Merger Agreement.
The Forecasts are based on numerous variables and assumptions made by Vonage management at the time prepared, including with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to
Vonage. Vonage management believes that these assumptions are both reasonable and supportable. The management of Vonage believes that the
Forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Vonage of the future
financial performance of Vonage.
The Forecasts include Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Operating Income, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, which are
defined as non-GAAP financial measures by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Vonage uses Adjusted EBITDA as a
principal indicator of the operating performance of its business. Vonage believes that Adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of its
operating performance, relative to its performance based on its U.S. General Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) results, while isolating the effects
of: interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance; of
share-based expense, which is a non-cash expense that also varies from period to period; of one-time acquisition related
 
44Table of Contents
transaction and integration costs, organizational transformation costs, restructuring activities and other non-recurring items. Organizational
transformation costs consist principally of costs in connection with exits of employees and facilities, system migration costs and certain professional
related fees. Restructuring activities relate to Vonage’s business-wide optimization and alignment project initiated in 2020 which included employee
related exits and further facility exit costs executed upon as part of the overall project. Other non-recurring items principally include certain litigation
charges, including defense costs, acquisition related expenses, gain on sale of intangible assets, and other non-recurring project costs such as the
Consumer business review and the business optimization project, both of which were initiated in 2020. The items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not
separately evaluated for each reportable operating segment. Vonage provides information relating to its Adjusted EBITDA so that investors have the
same data that Vonage employs in assessing its overall operations. Vonage believes that trends in its Adjusted EBITDA are valuable indicators of the
operating performance of Vonage on a consolidated basis. Vonage did not reconcile its forward-looking Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP
Operating Income, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the corresponding GAAP measure because due to the forward-looking nature of
these projections they could be significantly impacted by future events, the timing and nature of which cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at
this time. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.
The following table presents a summary of the Forecasts:(1)

The inclusion of information about the Forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that any of Vonage, Parent or any
other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, them necessarily predictive of actual future results or material information given the
inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such forecasts. The Forecasts are subjective in many respects and, thus, subject to interpretation.
Although presented with numeric specificity, the Forecasts reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance and
competition, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and matters specific to Vonage’s businesses, including the factors listed under
“Risk Factors” in Vonage’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which
are beyond Vonage’s or Parent’s control. Vonage cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions underlying the Forecasts will be realized.
Many of the assumptions reflected in the Forecasts are subject to change and the Forecasts do not reflect revised prospects for Vonage’s
business, changes in general business or economic conditions or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that Vonage did
not anticipate at the time such financial information was prepared. Vonage has not updated and does not intend to update or otherwise revise the
Forecasts. There can be no assurance that the results reflected in the Forecasts will be realized or that actual results will not materially vary from the
Forecasts. In addition, the Forecasts cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.
Therefore, the Forecasts included in this proxy statement should not be relied on as necessarily predictive of actual future events nor construed as
financial guidance.
Vonage stockholders are urged to review Vonage’s SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to Vonage’s business. Please see the
section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” beginning on page 21 for additional information regarding the risks
inherent in forward-looking information such as the Forecasts and the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 110.
The Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward complying with GAAP (including because certain metrics are non-GAAP measures, and the
forecasts contained therein do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections
or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information. Neither Vonage’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or
performed any procedures with respect to the Forecasts, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on the Forecasts or the
achievability of the results reflected in the Forecasts, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the Forecasts. Non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-
GAAP financial measures such as those used in the Forecasts may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies or persons.
For the reasons described above, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Forecasts. Vonage has
not made any representation to Parent in the Merger Agreement concerning any of the Forecasts.

Vonage retained Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to the Board in connection with a potential transaction such as the Merger and to
evaluate whether the merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and
in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent),
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Vonage selected Qatalyst Partners to act as Vonage’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’
qualifications, expertise, reputation, its knowledge of Vonage’s business and the industry in which Vonage operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its
written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the Board on November 21, 2021, Qatalyst Partners rendered
to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of November 21, 2021 and based upon and subject to the various

without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage
Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following the meeting, Qatalyst
Partners delivered its written opinion, dated November 21, 2021, to the Board.
The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated as of November 21, 2021, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated
into this proxy statement by reference. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its
entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent),
to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any Vonage stockholder as to how to
vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of Vonage Common Stock will
trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion,
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
For purposes of its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft, dated as of November 21, 2021, of the Merger Agreement (the “Draft Merger
Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Vonage.
Qatalyst Partners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to Vonage prepared by senior management of Vonage, including the
Forecasts, described more fully in the section entitled “The Merger—Certain Financial Projections Utilized in Connection with the Merger.”
Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Vonage with senior management
of Vonage. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Vonage Common Stock and compared the financial

terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and
considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Vonage. With respect to the
Forecasts, Qatalyst Partners was advised by Vonage’s management, and Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the Forecasts had been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Vonage of the future financial performance of Vonage and
other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Draft Merger
Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. Qatalyst Partners also assumed that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any
material respect from the Draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Qatalyst Partners. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the
receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an
adverse effect on Vonage or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Vonage or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of Vonage as to
the existing and future technology and products of Vonage and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has
been approved by Qatalyst Partners’ opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which the shares of
Vonage Common Stock will trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions
used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion did not
address the underlying business decision of Vonage to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic
alternatives that may be available to Vonage. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst Partners
expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of Vonage or
any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration at any time.

analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all
analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For purposes of its analyses,

19, 2021 (the “Analyst Projections”) and the Forecasts. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format.

Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential per-share present values
for Vonage Common Stock as of September 30, 2021 (which is the end of Vonage’s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent balance sheet
date) by:
 
 
•
 adding:
 
 
(a)
the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of Vonage, based on the Forecasts, for the
fourth quarter of calendar year 2021 through calendar year 2025 (which implied present value was calculated by using a range
of discount rates of 6.5% to 11.5%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for Vonage);
 
 
(b)
the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Vonage, calculated by multiplying Vonage’s estimated
Adjusted EBITDA in calendar year 2026 based on the Forecasts by a range of multiples of fully diluted enterprise value to
next-twelve-months estimated EBITDA of 20.0x to 25.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional
judgment), and discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above; and
 
 
(c)
Vonage’s cash and cash equivalents of approximately $48 million as of September 30, 2021, as provided in Vonage’s Form 10-Q
filed on November 4, 2021; and
 
 
•
 subtracting the face value of Vonage’s outstanding convertible debt and the principal amount of Vonage’s outstanding revolving credit
facility, of approximately $496 million in the aggregate, each as of September 30, 2021, as provided in Vonage’s Form 10-Q filed on November
4, 2021; and
 
 
•
 dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully-diluted shares of Vonage Common Stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock
method), which takes into account Restricted Stock Units, Performance Restricted Stock Units and Company Options as of November 19,
2021, all of which amounts were provided by Vonage’s management, and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt
(excluding any make-whole or other change of control adjustments), with each of the above-referenced estimated future unlevered free cash
flows and terminal value having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution to current stockholders through each respective
applicable period (approximately 2% annually throughout the projection period) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and
cancellations related to future equity compensation, based on estimates of future dilution provided by Vonage management.
Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Vonage Common Stock of approximately $15.98 to
$24.51.

Based upon the Analyst Projections as of November 19, 2021 for calendar year 2022, and using the closing trading prices as of November 19, 2021
for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated
consensus revenue for calendar year 2022 (the “CY2022E Revenue Multiples”) for each of the selected companies.
The CY2022E Revenue Multiple for Vonage was 3.2x based on the Analyst Projections, and the fully-diluted enterprise value of Vonage was
calculated using the closing price of Vonage Common Stock as of November 19, 2021.
Based on an analysis of the CY2022E Revenue Multiples for each of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of
2.5x to 4.5x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment) and applied this range to Vonage’s estimated calendar year 2022
revenue based on each of the Analyst Projections and the Forecasts. In addition, for the purpose of this analysis, Qatalyst Partners calculated Vonage’s
enterprise value assuming Vonage’s net debt of approximately $448 million as of September 30, 2021, as provided in Vonage’s Form 10-Q filed on
November 4, 2021. Based on the calculations set forth above and the number of fully-diluted shares of Vonage Common Stock (calculated using the

No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Vonage. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many

and the absence of any material adverse change in Vonage’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general.

For each of the transactions listed above, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (i) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target

Multiple”) and (ii) the
 
51Table of Contents
implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-months
revenue of the target company (the “NTM Revenue Multiple”).
Based on the analysis of the LTM Revenue Multiple for each of the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple
range of 3.0x to 5.5x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment) and applied this range to Vonage’s revenue for the twelve-
month period ending on September 30, 2021, of $1,366 million as provided in Vonage’s Form 10-Q filed on November 4, 2021. Based on the number of fully
diluted shares of Vonage Common Stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), which takes into account Restricted Stock Units, Performance
Restricted Stock Units and Company Options as of November 19, 2021, all of which amounts were provided by Vonage’s management, and assuming cash
settlement of Vonage’s convertible debt, including the value of additional make-whole shares and cash settlement of the capped call transactions entered
into by Vonage with respect to its convertible debt based on a Black-Scholes option valuation model, each based on an assumed transaction close date of
March 31, 2022, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Vonage Common Stock of approximately $13.42 to $25.46.
Based on the analysis of the NTM Revenue Multiple for each of the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple
range of 2.5x to 5.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment) and applied this range to Vonage’s estimated revenue for the
twelve-month period ending on September 30, 2022, of $1,508 million based on the Analyst Forecasts. Based on the number of fully diluted shares of
Vonage Common Stock (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), which takes into account Restricted Stock Units, Performance Restricted Stock
Units and Company Options as of November 19, 2021, all of which amounts were provided by Vonage’s management, and assuming cash settlement of
Vonage’s convertible debt, including the value of additional make-whole shares and cash settlement of the capped call transactions entered into by
Vonage with respect to its convertible debt based on a Black-Scholes option valuation model, each based on an assumed transaction close date of March
31, 2022, this analysis implied a range of per share values for Vonage Common Stock of approximately $12.24 to $25.56.
No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Vonage or the Merger. In evaluating the selected
transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond Vonage’s control, such as the impact of competition on Vonage’s business or the industry generally, industry growth and the
absence of any material adverse change in Vonage’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could
affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or
mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company
data. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on
this information.

VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Sum of the Parts Analysis,"Sum of the Parts Analysis
Qatalyst Partners conducted a sum of the parts valuation analysis to calculate the enterprise value of each of the three segments of Vonage’s
business (its application programming interface segment (the “API Segment”), its unified communications and contact center segment (the “UC/CC
Segment”) and its consumer segment (the “Consumer Segment”)) on a stand-alone basis based on the Forecasts. In its analysis, as discussed with
Vonage’s management, Qatalyst Partners assumed no transactional costs or tax leakage costs in the separation of Vonage into its three segments.
For each of the API Segment and the UC/CC Segment, Qatalyst Partners compared selected financial information for each such segment with
publicly available information and public market multiples for certain of the selected companies set forth above in the section entitled “—Selected
Companies Analysis”, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgement.
 
52Table of Contents
Based upon the Analyst Projections as of November 19, 2021 for calendar year 2022, and using the closing trading prices as of November 19, 2021
for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated
consensus gross profit for calendar year 2022 (the “CY2022E Gross Profit Multiples”) for each of the selected API companies.
Based on an analysis of the CY2022E Gross Profit Multiples for each of the selected API companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative
range of 10.0x to 20.0x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment) and applied this range to the API Segment’s estimated
calendar year 2022 gross profit of $179 million as provided by the Company as part of the Forecasts. This analysis implied a range of enterprise values for
the API Segment of approximately $1,792 million to $3,584 million.
Based on an analysis of the CY2022E Revenue Multiples for each of the selected UCaaS & CCaaS companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a
representative range of 2.5x to 4.5x (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment) and applied this range to the UC/CC
Segment’s estimated calendar year 2022 revenue of $580 million as provided by the Company as part of the Forecasts. This analysis implied a range of
enterprise values for the UC/CC Segment of approximately $1,451 million to $2,612 million.
For the Consumer Segment, Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the implied enterprise value of the
Consumer Segment as of September 30, 2021 by adding (a) the implied net present value of the estimated future free cash flows of the Consumer Segment,
based on the Forecasts, for the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021 through calendar year 2025 (which implied present value was calculated by using a
range of discount rates of 6.5% to 11.5%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for Vonage and (b) the implied net present value of a
corresponding terminal value of the Consumer Segment, calculated by applying to the Consumer Segment’s free cash flows for the calendar year ended
December 31, 2026 a perpetuity growth rate of negative 13% consistent with expected growth through 2026 based on the Forecasts, and discounted to
present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above. This analysis implied a range of enterprise values for the Consumer Segment
of approximately $505 million to $578 million.
Qatalyst Partners then took the aggregate implied range of enterprise values of the three combined segments, netted their value against the amount
of Vonage’s projected net debt as of September 30, 2021, as provided in Vonage’s Form 10-Q filed on November 4, 2021, and divided the resulting amount
by the number of fully-diluted shares of Vonage Common Stock (calculated using the treasury stock method), which takes into account Restricted Stock
Units, Performance Restricted Stock Units and Company Options as of November 19, 2021, all of which amounts were provided by Vonage’s management,
and assuming net share settlement of in-the-money convertible debt (excluding any make-whole or other change of control adjustments), to imply a range
of per share values for Vonage Common Stock of approximately $12.11 to $23.20.",60,61

In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all
analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may
have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less
probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be
Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of Vonage. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Vonage’s
 
53Table of Contents
control. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. This
analysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the price at which Vonage Common Stock might actually trade at any time.
Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors considered by the Board in deciding to approve the Merger
Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board with respect to the merger
consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without interest thereon, to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), or of whether the Board
would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The merger consideration of $21.00 per share of Vonage Common Stock in cash, without
interest thereon, payable in the Merger was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Vonage and Parent and was unanimously approved
by the Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Vonage during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific
consideration to Vonage or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from
which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short
positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Vonage, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.
During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates
and Vonage or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the
future provide investment banking and other financial services to Vonage or Parent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners would
expect to receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provided Vonage with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed Merger for which it will be paid
approximately $73 million, $250,000 of which was payable upon the execution of the engagement letter and $5 million of which was payable upon the
delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the
consummation of the Merger. Vonage has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. Vonage has
also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any
person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities law, and certain
expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.

Members of the Board and our executive officers have various interests in the Merger described in this section that may be in addition to, or
different from, the interests of Vonage stockholders generally. You should keep this in mind when considering the recommendation of the Board for the
adoption of the Merger Agreement. The members of the Board were aware of these interests, among other matters, and considered them at the time they
approved the Merger Agreement and in making their recommendation that Vonage stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests, along with

As further described below in the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Treatment of Equity Awards” beginning on page 70,
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock Units, including those held by the Company’s executive
officers, will be treated as follows:
 
 
•
 Each Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will terminate and
be cancelled in exchange for: (i) with respect to Restricted Stock Units that become vested in accordance with their terms on or prior to the
Effective Time but have not yet been paid, the right to receive a lump sum cash payment, payable shortly following the Effective Time, in the
amount equal to (A) the number of shares of Vonage Common Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Unit, multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) with respect to all other Restricted Stock Units, a new cash-based award representing the right to receive an unvested
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Vonage Common Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Unit, multiplied by (B) the
Merger Consideration, which vesting will be subject to the continued employment of the former holder of such Restricted Stock Unit with
Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), on the same vesting schedule (including with respect to any terms providing
for acceleration of vesting, such as upon certain terminations of employment prior to the scheduled vesting date, as described below) and
otherwise on substantially the same terms as the corresponding Restricted Stock Unit.
 
 
•
 Each Performance Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will
terminate and be cancelled in exchange for: (i) with respect to Performance Restricted Stock Units with a performance period that ends on or
prior to the Effective Time, the right to receive a lump sum cash payment, payable shortly following the Effective Time, in the amount equal
to (A) the number of shares of Vonage Common Stock subject to such Performance Restricted Stock Unit that vested based on the actual
level of achievement under the awards, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration and (ii) with respect to all other Performance Restricted
Stock Units, a new cash-based award representing the right to receive an unvested amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of
Vonage Common Stock subject to such Performance Restricted Stock Unit that would vest based on the actual level of achievement as of
the Effective Time compared against pro-rated performance measures as of the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration,
which vesting will be subject to the continued employment of the former holder of such Performance Restricted Stock Unit with Parent and
its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), on the same time-based vesting schedule (including with respect to any terms providing
for acceleration of vesting, such as upon certain terminations of employment prior to the scheduled vesting date, as described below) and
otherwise on substantially the same terms as the corresponding Performance Restricted Stock Unit.
 
 
•
 As described further below under “Section 280G Mitigation Actions”, certain executive officers were issued restricted shares of Vonage
Common Stock in settlement of certain of their Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock Units. Such restricted shares of
Vonage Common Stock are subject to the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock
Units that were settled and will generally be treated in the same manner as the Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock
Units under the Merger Agreement as described above.
Pursuant to the Company’s forms of Restricted Stock Unit award agreement and Performance Restricted Stock Unit award agreement (under which
all outstanding Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Units were granted), all executive officers are entitled to the acceleration of all
unvested Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock Units following a termination without cause or a resignation for “good reason”, in
each case on or within one year following the Effective Time.
 
55Table of Contents
The following table sets forth the number of shares of Vonage Common Stock underlying outstanding unvested Restricted Stock Units and
Performance Restricted Stock Units and the restricted shares of Vonage Common Stock that would be held by our executive officers as of March 1, 2022
assuming the Merger closes on such date (taking into account any vesting of their outstanding awards that occurs prior to such date) and the unvested
cash proceeds that such unvested awards will be converted into in connection with the Merger, assuming that the relevant price per share of Vonage
Common Stock is $21.00, which is the price per share of Vonage Common Stock to be paid in connection with the Merger. All share numbers have been
rounded to the nearest whole number.

As described above, certain Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock Units were settled with restricted shares of Vonage Common
Stock subject to the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock Units. Certain restricted
shares of Vonage Common Stock included in the table above were converted to cash to satisfy withholding taxes.
Two non-employee directors, Carolyn Katz and John Roberts, hold vested Company Options. Each Company Option that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will terminate and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment, payable shortly
following the Effective Time, in the amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Vonage Common Stock underlying the Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) an amount equal to the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price. Ms. Katz holds 150,000 Company
Options and Mr. Roberts holds 30,000 Company Options and the cash proceeds that each individual would receive as a result of the Merger in respect of
vested Company Options, that would be held by such non-employee director as of March 1, 2022 assuming the Merger closes on such date, equals
$2,440,500 and $565,000, respectively.

On November 21, 2021, Mr. Read entered into a letter agreement with Parent (the “Letter Agreement”) setting forth certain understandings with
respect to Mr. Read’s Employment Agreement with the Company dated June 5, 2020 and his outstanding Restricted Stock Units and Performance
Restricted Stock Units, to be effective on, and subject to the occurrence of, the closing of the Merger.
Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Mr. Read has agreed that his Employment Agreement will be amended to remove his existing right to resign for
“good reason” as a result of his no longer holding the position of Chief Executive Officer of a publicly traded company or the Company not nominating
him for election to the Board or removing him from the Board, in each case which would otherwise entitle him to severance payments under his
Employment Agreement and accelerated vesting of his outstanding Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock Units. The parties have also
agreed to certain other changes to the definitions of termination for “good reason” and termination for cause for such purposes.
The Letter Agreement provides that Mr. Read’s Restricted Stock Units that are scheduled to vest in 2022 (506,666 units, a portion of which have
been settled in restricted shares of Vonage Common Stock), which would otherwise be converted to a cash-based award as provided in the Merger
Agreement, will become vested and payable in cash upon the closing of the Merger. The amounts so paid will be subject to clawback in the event that
Mr. Read voluntarily resigns his employment without “good reason” (as amended by the Letter Agreement) prior to the originally scheduled vesting
dates. In addition, 50% of Mr. Read’s Performance Restricted Stock Units (390,000 units, assuming target performance and 780,000, assuming maximum
performance) that would otherwise be converted to a cash- based award as provided in the Merger Agreement will instead become vested and payable in
cash upon the closing of the Merger. The amounts so paid will be subject to clawback in the event that Mr. Read voluntarily resigns without “good
reason” (as amended) prior to the originally scheduled vesting dates. The remainder of Mr. Read’s outstanding Restricted Stock Units and Performance
Restricted Stock Units (506,668 units and 390,000 units, assuming target performance, or 780,000 units, assuming maximum performance, respectively), as
converted into cash-based awards as provided in the Merger Agreement, will continue to become vested and payable in accordance with their original
vesting schedule, subject to Mr. Read’s continued employment following the Merger (subject to acceleration upon termination without cause or
resignation for “good reason”). Parent has agreed to establish a rabbi trust to hold such cash amounts.
The Letter Agreement provides Mr. Read the opportunity to receive a “performance retention incentive payment” from Parent following the closing
of the Merger with a targeted value of $12 million. The amount payable (if any) will be determined based on performance metrics tied to the Company’s
business, 50% with respect to 2022 performance and 50% with respect to 2023 performance. The performance retention incentive payment will be payable
on the Company’s first normal payroll payment date following July 1, 2024, subject to Mr. Read’s continued employment through such date, subject to
proration upon termination without cause or resignation for “good reason”, based on actual performance as of the date of termination. The Letter
Agreement also provides for certain tax indemnification payments up to a maximum amount of $4 million.

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company is permitted to implement strategies to mitigate the possible impact of Section 280G of the
Code. On December 27, 2021, the compensation committee of the Board approved with respect to certain executive officers, (i) the payment, on or prior to
December 31, 2021, of annual cash bonuses for calendar year 2021 that otherwise would be payable in 2022 and (ii) the settlement (in whole or in part), on
or prior to December 31, 2021, of certain restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards for restricted shares of Vonage Common Stock,
less the appropriate withholding taxes, with the same vesting terms as such restricted stock unit awards and performance stock unit awards. Such
executive officers entered into agreement with the Company providing for the actions described above and including the potential forfeiture and
clawback described below. The executive officers have made elections under Section 83(b) of the
 
59Table of Contents
Internal Revenue Code with respect to such shares of Company restricted stock. The actions described above have the effect of providing compensation
in 2021 that would have otherwise been paid in a future year, but have not changed the vesting requirements as a result of the forfeiture and clawback
provisions applicable to such compensation, as described below.

•
 For Rory Read, an accelerated bonus payment in the amount of $1,221,875 and the settlement of 298,056 restricted stock units with 180,770

the Effective Time (including the Merger Agreement and the Transactions), arising out of or based on, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified
Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Vonage, or was serving at the request of Vonage as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
person prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation will and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to also advance expenses as incurred
to any such Indemnified Party as long as such Indemnified Party undertakes to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.
Prior to the Effective Time, Vonage will, and if Vonage is unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain
and fully pay for “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as Vonage’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as Vonage’s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Transactions). In no event will Vonage be required to pay an annual premium for such
policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid as of the date of the Merger Agreement by Vonage for such insurance. If Vonage for any reason
fails to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time Vonage’s existing policies, or the Surviving Corporation
will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase a comparable policy for such six-year period with such benefits and levels of coverage
at least as favorable as Vonage’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement. In no event will Vonage be required to pay, or Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay for such policies, an annual premium in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid as of the date of the Merger
Agreement by Vonage for such insurance. If the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation will obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
In addition, for not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that
the Surviving Corporation maintains provisions in the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnified Parties that are no less favorable than the analogous provisions contained in the organizational
documents of Vonage and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the tables below present the estimated amounts of compensation that each named executive
officer could receive that are based on or otherwise related to the Merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the
applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section, we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable to Vonage’s named executive
officers. This Merger-related compensation is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of Vonage’s stockholders. See the section entitled “Proposal 2:
Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal,” on page 30.

The amounts set forth below have been calculated assuming the Merger is consummated on March 1, 2022, and, where applicable, assuming each
named executive officer experiences a termination of their employment without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as
such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements) (a “Qualifying Termination”) as of March 1, 2022. The amounts indicated below are
estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive officers, and the estimates are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur. The amounts below are based on a price per share of Vonage Common Stock of $21.00, which is the price per share of Vonage Common
Stock to be paid in connection with the Merger. Some of the assumptions are based on information not currently available, and as a result, the actual
amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts set forth

Certain Effects of the Merger",69,71
VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Certain Effects of the Merger,"Certain Effects of the Merger
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote on
such matter and the other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into Vonage upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. As the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, Vonage will continue
to exist following the Merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
Following the Merger, all of Vonage’s equity interests will be legally and beneficially owned by Parent, and none of Vonage’s current stockholders
will, by virtue of the Merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, Vonage, the Surviving Corporation or Parent after the completion of
the Merger. As a result, Vonage’s current stockholders will no longer benefit from any increase in the value, nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in
the value, of Vonage Common Stock. Following the Merger, Parent will benefit from any increase in Vonage’s enterprise value and also will bear the risk of
any decrease in Vonage’s enterprise value.
Upon completion of the Merger, each share of Vonage Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled, will cease to exist and will be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, net of any applicable withholding taxes and without interest. See the section of entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Merger
Consideration and Effect of the Merger on Certain Securities,” beginning on page 69.
For information regarding the effects of the Merger on Vonage’s outstanding Equity Awards, please see the section entitled “The Merger—Interests
of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 54, and the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Treatment of
Equity Awards,” beginning on page 70.
Vonage Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on NASDAQ under the symbol “VG.” Following the completion
of the Merger, shares of Vonage Common Stock will no longer be traded on NASDAQ or any other public market. In addition, the registration of shares of
Vonage Common Stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and Vonage will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC
with respect to Vonage Common Stock. Termination of registration of Vonage Common Stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the information required
to be furnished by Vonage to Vonage’s stockholders and the SEC, and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file
annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders’ meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer
applicable to Vonage to the extent that they apply solely as a result of the registration of Vonage Common Stock under the Exchange Act.

If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock representing a majority of the outstanding
shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote on such matter or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive the Merger
Consideration or any other consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for your shares of Vonage Common Stock. Instead, Vonage will remain a public
company, and Vonage Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. We expect that our management will operate our business in a
manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock will continue to be subject to the same
risks and opportunities as they currently are subject to with respect to their ownership of Vonage Common Stock. If the Merger is not completed, there
can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of Vonage Common Stock, including the risk that the market price
of Vonage Common Stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of Vonage Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger
will be completed. If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock representing a majority of the
outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to vote on such matter or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no
assurance that any other transaction acceptable to us will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely
impacted.
In addition, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Vonage will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of
$200,000,000. The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent may be required to pay Vonage a termination fee of $200,000,000 if the Merger Agreement
is terminated due to failure to obtain CFIUS Clearance (as defined in the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Efforts to Complete the
Merger”). If the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company for failure to obtain the Company Requisite Vote, then the Company will be
required to pay Parent a termination fee of $61,000,000.
Financing of the Merger",72,72

We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger, including the funds needed to pay Vonage stockholders and holders of other
equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the Merger Agreement, which would be approximately $6.2 billion based upon the number of
shares of Vonage Common Stock (and other equity-based interests) outstanding as of the Record Date, will be funded through Parent’s cash on-hand. 
The completion of the Merger is not conditioned upon Parent’s receipt of financing.

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Vonage Common Stock
who receive cash for their shares of Vonage Common Stock in the Merger. This summary is general in nature, for information purposes only, and does not
purport to discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances. In
addition, this summary does not address the Medicare tax on net investment income or describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or foreign jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation.
This summary only addresses shares of Vonage Common Stock held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), generally, property held for investment. This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax
consequences to U.S. Holders who demand appraisal rights under Delaware law. This summary also does not address tax considerations applicable to
any U.S. Holders that may be subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including:
 
 
•
 a bank, insurance company or other financial institution;
 
 
•
 a tax-exempt organization;

•
 a holder that holds shares of Vonage Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other risk reduction

This summary is based on the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code and rulings and judicial decisions, all as in effect as of
the date of this proxy statement, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, with possible retroactive effect. We have
not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to the statements made and the
conclusions reached in the following summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a
court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
For purposes of this discussion, we use the term “U.S. Holder” to mean a beneficial owner of shares of Vonage Common Stock that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:
 
 
•
 an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
 
 
•
 a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
 
•
 a trust that (i) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S. persons or (ii) has a valid
election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or
 
 
•
 an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) beneficially owns shares of
Vonage Common Stock, the tax treatment of the partnership and its partners generally will depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the
partnership. A partner in a partnership holding shares of Vonage Common Stock should consult such partner’s tax advisor.

General. A U.S. Holder’s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Vonage Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, and such U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and
the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Vonage Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger. Gain or loss will be
determined separately for each block of shares of Vonage Common Stock (that is, shares of Vonage Common Stock acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction). Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the
shares of Vonage Common Stock is more than one year at the Effective Time. Long-term capital gain recognized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder generally
is subject to tax at a reduced rate of U.S. federal income tax. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting. In addition, all payments to which a U.S.
Holder would be entitled pursuant to the Merger will be subject to backup withholding at the statutory rate unless such holder (i) is a corporation or
other exempt recipient (and, when required, demonstrates this fact), or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number (a “TIN”) and certifies, under penalty
of perjury, that the U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding
rules. A U.S. Holder that does not otherwise establish exemption should complete and sign the IRS Form W-9, in order to provide the information and
certification necessary to avoid backup withholding and possible penalties. If a U.S. Holder does not provide a correct TIN, such U.S. Holder may be
subject to backup withholding and penalties imposed by the IRS.
Any amount paid as backup withholding does not constitute an additional tax and will be creditable against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, provided the required information is given to the IRS in a timely manner. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a U.S. Holder
may obtain a refund by filing a U.S. federal income tax return in a timely manner.

VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Non-U.S. Holders,"Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this summary, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Vonage Common Stock (other than a partnership
or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. Holder.
Generally, the exchange of shares of Vonage Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will not be a taxable transaction to Non-U.S. Holders
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless: (i) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
taxable year of the Merger and certain other conditions are met; (ii) the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or
business in the United States and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in
the United States; or (iii) Vonage is or has been a United States real property holding corporation, or “USRPHC,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at
any time within the shorter of the Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period and the five-year period preceding the Merger, the Non-U.S. Holder owned (directly,
indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of the shares of Vonage Common Stock at any time within such period, and certain other conditions are
satisfied.
In the case of clause (i) of the preceding paragraph, gain generally will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified
under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is
not considered a resident of the
 
66Table of Contents
United States). In the case of clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, unless a tax treaty provides otherwise, gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
at the rates generally applicable to a U.S. Holder (and such Non-U.S. Holder should generally provide an IRS Form W-8ECI). A Non-U.S. Holder that is a
foreign corporation also may be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (or applicable lower treaty rate) with respect to gain recognized under clause (ii). In
the case of clause (iii) of the preceding paragraph, Non-U.S. Holders that have actually or constructively owned more than 5% of the shares of Vonage
Common Stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the process for requesting documentation from Vonage to establish whether the Company is a
USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes and any consequences with respect thereto. Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors with
respect to the particular U.S. federal, state, and local, or foreign tax consequences of the Merger and the effect of any applicable tax treaties.

Under the Merger Agreement, the respective obligations of Vonage, Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are subject to (i) the waiting period
under the HSR Act having expired or been earlier terminated, (ii) regulatory clearances having been obtained under certain foreign Antitrust Laws and (iii)
having obtained CFIUS Clearance (as defined in the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Efforts to Complete the Merger”). On
December 3, 2021, Vonage and Parent filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”),
which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. The HSR Act waiting period expired on January 3, 2022.
Vonage and Parent filed a “declaration” with CFIUS on December 29, 2021. Following acceptance of the declaration by CFIUS, a 30 calendar day
“assessment” period will begin. At or prior to the expiration of this assessment period, CFIUS may take one of the following actions: (1) notify the parties
that CFIUS has concluded all action, effectively clearing the Merger; (2) initiate a unilateral “review” of the Merger, which involves a review period of up
to 45 calendar days, followed, if necessary, by an investigation period of up to 45 calendar days, followed, if CFIUS does not conclude all action, by a
Presidential Review period of 15 calendar days during which time the President of the United States may decide whether to take action regarding the
Merger, including its suspension or prohibition; (3) request that the parties file a “notice,” which the parties would file and which, upon acceptance,
would initiate a review period as described in (2); or (4) inform the parties that CFIUS is not able to conclude action on the basis of the declaration and

if CFIUS informs them that it has concluded all action or informs them that it is not able to conclude action but does not request a notice or initiate a
unilateral review.
At any time before or after the Effective Time, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the DOJ, antitrust authorities outside the United States
or U.S. state attorneys general or CFIUS could take action under applicable Antitrust Laws (as defined in the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of
Merger—Efforts to Complete the Merger”), including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, conditionally approving the Merger upon the
divestiture of Vonage’s or Parent’s assets, subjecting the completion of the Merger to regulatory conditions or seeking other remedies. Private parties
may also seek to take legal action under the Antitrust Laws under certain circumstances.",75,75

Between January 5 and January 7, 2022, certain purported stockholders of Vonage have filed securities lawsuits in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, captioned Shiva Stein v. Vonage Holdings Corp, et al. (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 5, 2022) and Marc Waterman v. Vonage
Holdings Corp, et al. (S.D.N.Y. Jan 7, 2022) (together, the “Actions”). The Actions name Vonage and the members of the Board as defendants. The
Actions assert claims under Section 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and allege that the Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on December 20, 2021 in
connection with the proposed transaction between Vonage and Parent is materially misleading. The Actions seek, among other things, to enjoin the
defendants from proceeding with, consummating or closing the Merger, rescissory damages should the Merger not be enjoined, and an award of
attorneys’ and experts’ fees. The defendants believe that the allegations in the suit are without merit. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new
or different allegations that are material, Vonage will not necessarily announce such filings.

The summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement set forth below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important
to you. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.
The Merger Agreement is described in this proxy statement and included as Annex A only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding Vonage, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Such information can
be found elsewhere in this proxy statement or, in the case of Vonage, in the public filings that Vonage makes with the SEC, which are available without
charge through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 110.
The representations, warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement by Vonage, Parent and Merger Sub are qualified and subject to
important limitations agreed to by Vonage, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In particular, in
your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that
the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger
Agreement may have the right not to close the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in
circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a
contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some
cases were qualified by disclosures that were made by Vonage, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information
concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have
changed since the date of the Merger Agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have
been included in this proxy statement.

together with any other change, event development, circumstance or effect: (a) has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse
effect on the business, assets, financial condition, operations or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay, materially impair or materially interfere with, or materially adversely affect the ability of the
Company or its subsidiaries to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions on or before May 22, 2022 (the “Termination Date”); provided, that in
the case of clause (a) above, none of the following will be deemed, either alone or in combination, to constitute, and there will not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect any adverse effect to the extent arising from or attributable or relating to:

 any natural or man-made disaster or acts of God, including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornados, volcanic eruptions, epidemics,

such COVID-19 Measures or official interpretations thereof following the date of the Merger Agreement or any acts of terrorism, sabotage,
riots, demonstrations, public disorders, military action or war or any escalation or worsening thereof;
 
 
•
 any failure by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to meet any internal or published budgets, projections, estimates, forecasts or

•
 a decline in the price of the shares of Vonage Common Stock, or a change in the trading volume of the shares of Vonage Common Stock, on
the NASDAQ, provided that the exceptions in this bullet and the one above will not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any
change, effect, circumstance or development underlying such failure or decline or change (if not otherwise falling within any of the
exclusions pursuant to the other clauses of this definition) has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect;
 
 
•
 changes in applicable law;
 
 
•
 changes in GAAP (or authoritative interpretation thereof);
 
 
•
 the taking of any specific action expressly required by the Merger Agreement or taken with Parent’s written consent, or the announcement
or pendency of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, including the impact thereof on the relationships with customers, suppliers,
distributors, partners, other third parties with whom the Company has a relationship or employees (including, but not limited to, any
cancellation of or delays in customer orders, any reduction in sales, any disruption in or loss of customer, supplier, distributor, partner or
similar relationships, or any loss of employees, but, in each case, excluding the Company’s compliance with its obligations pursuant to the
interim operations covenant (described in the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Covenants Regarding Conduct of
Business by Vonage Prior to the Merger”), provided that this clause will not apply with respect to any representation or warranty that is

of the Transactions;

The changes, effects, circumstances or developments set forth in bullets one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, and eleven will be taken into
account in determining whether a “Company Material Adverse Effect” has occurred to the extent such changes, effects, circumstances or developments
have a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other participants in the industries in which the
Company and its subsidiaries operate, but, in such event, only the incremental disproportionate impact of such changes, effects, circumstances or
developments will be taken into account in determining whether a “Company Material Adverse Effect” has occurred.

respective directors, officers, and employees, and will instruct and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’ respective
Representatives, not to, directly or indirectly:

not restrict the Company from permitting a person to request the waiver of a “standstill” or similar obligation or from granting such a waiver, in each case,
to the extent both (A) permitting such request or granting such waiver is necessary for the Board to comply with fiduciary duties under applicable law
and (B) such standstill or similar obligation prevents a confidential proposal from being made to the Board.
The Company will not (i) except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, terminate (or permit the termination of), waive or amend, or grant
any exemptions under, the Preservation Plan, (ii) redeem any Company Rights (as defined in the Merger Agreement) under the Preservation Plan or (iii)

delayed).
“Acquisition Proposal” is defined in the Merger Agreement to mean any proposal, offer, inquiry or indication of interest (other than by Parent or
Merger Sub) to engage in an Acquisition Transaction.
“Acquisition Transaction” is defined in the Merger Agreement to mean any transaction or series of transactions involving (i) any merger,
consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination, joint venture, partnership,
dissolution, liquidation, spin-off, extraordinary dividend or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is structured to
permit any person or “group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons to, directly or indirectly, hold securities representing
twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of Vonage Common Stock after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction or series of
transactions, (ii) any direct or indirect purchase, license or other acquisition by any person or group of persons of assets constituting or accounting for
twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets (measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of
such purchase, license or other acquisition) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (iii) any direct or indirect acquisition by any
person or group of persons, whether from the Company or any other persons, of securities representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding
shares of Vonage Common Stock after giving effect to the consummation of such acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by
such person or group of persons, in each case, other than the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the non-solicitation provision described above, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite
Vote is obtained, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-
solicitation provision in any material respect, (i) provide access to non-public information regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the person
who made such Acquisition Proposal; provided that such information has previously been made available to Parent or is provided to Parent promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following the time such information is made available to such person and that, prior to furnishing any
such non-public information, the Company receives from the person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms
at least as restrictive in all material respects on such person (including its affiliates and Representatives) as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
on Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition Proposal confidentially
made to the Board) (an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”); provided further, that competitively sensitive information provided to any such
person who is a competitor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will only be provided in a separate “clean data room” and subject to customary
“clean team” arrangements regarding access to such information, and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
 
81
Table of Contents
negotiations with any such person regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the
Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that (A) based on the information then available and after consultation
with its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties
under applicable law.
The Merger Agreement provides that the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent in writing if the
Company receives, or, to the knowledge of the Company, its Representatives receive: (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request by any person for
information or access concerning the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any discussions or
negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with the Company, and, in each instance, the Company will
indicate in such notice the identity of such person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal, copies of any such Acquisition Proposal, Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, request made in writing and any other written terms and proposals provided (including financing commitments) to the Company
or its Representatives, and a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in writing. The foregoing
obligations on the part of the Company will apply with respect to any and all amended, revised or subsequent Acquisition Proposals and requests.
Additionally, the Company will keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of any material
development, of the status and terms of any proposals, offers or requests and the status of any such discussions or negotiations (including any material
amendments or proposed amendments as to the price, form of consideration, and other material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal).
The Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to enter into any contract with any person that prohibits or otherwise limits the Company
from complying with its obligations described above or providing any information required by the Merger Agreement to Parent or its Representatives.
“Superior Proposal” is defined in the Merger Agreement to mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a third party that did not
result from any breach of the Merger Agreement (except that for purposes of this definition the references to “twenty percent (20%) or more” in the
definition of Acquisition Transaction will be deemed to be references to “more than fifty percent (50%)” in each place it appears), after the date of the
Merger Agreement that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) (i) is more favorable to
the holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock from a financial point of view than the Transactions (taking into account (A) all financial considerations;
(B) the identity of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal; (C) the anticipated timing, conditions (including any financing condition or the
reliability of any debt or equity funding commitments) and prospects for completion of such Acquisition Proposal; (D) the other terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal and the implications thereof on the Company, including relevant legal, regulatory, and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal deemed relevant by the Board; and (E) any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Merger proposed by Parent during any
notice period set forth in the Merger Agreement provisions related to Acquisition Proposals); (ii) is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal.

Following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from a breach of the
Merger Agreement, in any material respect, and that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board may, at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, make a Change in
Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each
case, only if all of the following conditions are met:
 
 
•
 the Company will have (i) as promptly as practicable, provided to Parent at least four (4) business days’ prior written notice before taking
such action, which notice will state expressly (A) that it has received a written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn and that
the Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (B) to the extent not previously provided to Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement (and without limiting the obligations under
the Merger Agreement), the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the
identity of the person or group making the Acquisition Proposal) and will have contemporaneously provided unredacted copies of all
Alternative Acquisition Agreements, proposals and other documents (including financing commitments) related to such Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such
Acquisition Proposal will require a new notice and an additional two (2) business day period) and (C) that, subject to the bullet point
directly below, the Board has determined to make a Change in Recommendation or to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into
the Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal absent revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
as applicable, (ii) prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation or such termination, as applicable, engaged in good faith with Parent
(to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such four (4) business day notice period (as it may be extended), which may be on a non-
exclusive basis, to consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any revision to the amount or form of
consideration or any other material term or condition of such Acquisition Proposal will extend such four (4) business day notice period for
an additional two (2) business days (it being further understood and agreed that there may be multiple extensions and that all notice
obligations of the Company set forth in the Merger Agreement will apply with respect to each such revision of the amount or form of
consideration or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal)), and (iii) complied in all material respects with its obligations under the
Merger Agreement provisions related to Acquisition Proposals; and

 after the expiration of the notice period or periods in the bullet point directly above, the Company’s Board will have determined, in good

Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable law.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries will enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement before the Merger Agreement has been
validly terminated in accordance with its terms, including payment of the Company Termination Fee (as defined in the section entitled “The Agreement
and Plan of Merger—Termination Fees”). 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event (as defined below),
the Board may, at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, make a Change in Recommendation, only if all of the following
conditions are met:
 
 
•
 the Company will have (i) promptly provided to Parent at least four (4) business days’ prior written notice before taking such action, which
notice will (A) set forth in reasonable detail information describing the underlying material facts giving rise to the Intervening Event and the
rationale for the Change in Recommendation and (B) state expressly that, subject to the bullet point directly below, the Board has
determined to make a Change in Recommendation absent revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (ii) prior to effecting such a
Change in Recommendation, engaged in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such four (4) business day
notice period to consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement such that the failure of
the Board to make a Change in Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event in accordance with the bullet point directly below
would no longer be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law and (iii) complied in all material respects with its
obligations under the Merger Agreement provisions related to Acquisition Proposals; and
 
 
•
 after the expiration of the notice period or periods in the bullet point directly above, the Board will have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that in light of such Intervening Event and after taking into account any
revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
“Intervening Event” means a material effect that (i) was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the execution of the Merger
Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which effect, or any
material consequence thereof, becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote and (ii) does
not relate to an Acquisition Proposal (which, for purposes of the Intervening Event definition, will be read without reference to the percentage thresholds
set forth in the definition of Acquisition Transaction); provided, that “Intervening Event” will exclude any event, circumstance, change or development
related to (A) any Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B)
consisting of or resulting from a breach of the Merger Agreement by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (C) changes in the price of the shares of
Vonage Common Stock, in and of itself (however, the underlying reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event unless excluded by any
other exclusion in this definition), (D) the fact that, in and of itself, the Company exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates or expectations
of the Company’s revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period, in and of itself (provided, that the underlying
reasons for the Company exceeding such projections, estimates or expectations may constitute an Intervening Event unless excluded by any other
exclusion in this definition) and (E) any event, fact or circumstance that relates solely to Parent or its affiliates.",90,92

under 31 CFR § 800.407, a joint voluntary notice.
Subject to the following paragraph, in the event that Vonage and Parent receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, Vonage and Parent will use their respective best efforts to submit as promptly as practicable, any additional
information and documentary material pursuant to such request and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate in connection with such response.
None of the parties, including their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, will knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken, or omit to take, any action
which such party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the Transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
Parent will not, without giving the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate and make any suggestions (to the extent reasonably practicable and
permitted by applicable law), and the Company will not, without Parent’s prior written consent, (i) enter into any timing or settlement or similar agreement,
or otherwise knowingly agree or commit to any arrangement, that would have the effect of extending, suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling the
expiration or termination of

agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement that would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the contemplated Transactions (or
that would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from consummating the contemplated Transaction).
“Antitrust Laws” means the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act and all other federal, state and foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees and other laws and orders that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or competition, as well as all laws and orders relating to foreign investment and national security,
including the laws relating to CFIUS.
Parent and Vonage will cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all filings, notifications, communications,
submissions, and any other actions pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Neither party nor its counsel will independently participate in any substantive
call or meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws with any governmental entity in respect of such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without first giving
the other party or its counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by such governmental entity, the opportunity to attend and
participate. To the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
 
•
 each party will notify the other, as far in advance as practicable, of any filing or material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of
its subsidiaries intends to make with any governmental entity related to antitrust matters or CFIUS;
 
 
•
 prior to submitting any such filing or making any such communication or inquiry, such party will provide the other party and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review, and will consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with, any such filing,
communication or inquiry;
 
 
•
 promptly following the submission of such filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other party with a copy of any such
filing or, if in written form, communication or inquiry, except to the extent the other party has access to such filing, communication or inquiry,
and
 
 
•
 consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any governmental
entity relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with any governmental entity relating
thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation rights, the Company and Parent each will act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably
practicable.
Each of Vonage and Parent, including their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, will use its respective best efforts to resolve any objections that
may be asserted by any governmental entity in connection with the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions and to
avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the Transactions.
Subject to certain restrictions with respect to the occurrence of a Substantial Detriment, if any administrative or judicial proceeding (including any
such proceeding by a private party) is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other Transaction as violative of any
Antitrust Law, each of Vonage and Parent has agreed to use its best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the Merger; provided, that Parent will bear fifty percent (50%) of all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket third party litigation fees and expenses associated directly with contesting or resisting any such formal action or proceeding once instituted.
Parent has no obligation to litigate in any court to seek to vacate or terminate or avoid the entry of, any decree, order or judgement under Section
721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the “DPA”), and the regulations related thereto.

Additionally, Parent’s obligations to take or cause to take any actions described below, will be subject, in each case, to the right of Parent, in
Parent’s good faith reasonable discretion, to take reasonable periods of time in order to advocate and negotiate with third parties and governmental
entities with respect to such actions.

 Subject to terms of the Merger Agreement, Parent will, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all communications, meetings, negotiations
and strategy in connection with obtaining consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or any governmental entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, and Parent will, on behalf of the parties, control and lead the defense strategy for dealing with any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding that is initiated or threatened to be initiated challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions that are brought by any governmental entity or relate to any Antitrust Laws; provided, that Parent will consult in good faith
with the Company in connection with and throughout all such controlling and leading.

or any exemption by, any non-governmental third party in connection with the Merger.
 
 
•
 Parent will not have any obligation to propose, undertake, or agree to any Regulatory Action if such Regulatory Action would reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate with all other Regulatory Actions, result in a Substantial Detriment (as defined below) or if
the effectiveness of any Regulatory Action is not conditioned upon the Closing.
“best efforts” means taking any and all actions (together with actions related to contesting any action set forth above, the “Regulatory Actions”)
necessary to obtain the consents, approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any governmental entity required to consummate the
Merger and Transactions as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date, including (i)(A) proposing, negotiating,
committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, hold separate, and other

interests now owned or hereafter acquired by Parent, (B) creating, terminating, or amending any existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations of Parent, the Company or their respective subsidiaries, (C) otherwise taking or committing to any action that would limit the freedom of
action of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries with respect to the operation of, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly,
any businesses, assets, products or equity interests of Parent, the Company or their respective subsidiaries, as applicable; provided, that such
Regulatory Actions shall be conditioned upon and become effective only from and after the Effective Time; and (ii) defending through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring prior to the Termination Date; provided further, that such litigation in
no way limits the obligation of Parent to, and to cause its controlled affiliates to, use its best efforts, and to take any and all steps necessary, to eliminate
each and every such impediment so as to be able to close the Transactions prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger
Agreement to the contrary, Parent has no obligation to litigate in any court to seek to vacate or terminate or avoid the entry of, any decree, order or
judgement under Section 721 of the DPA, and the regulations related thereto.

operating metrics, of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), including taking into account, for the avoidance of doubt, any material
impairment of the prospects or loss of the benefits and/or advantages reasonably expected to be received by Parent from the Transactions; and (ii) in the
case of all other Regulatory Actions, a material adverse impact on the combined business of the Company (or the Surviving Corporation) and its
subsidiaries, Parent, or the pro forma Parent (together with the Company and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole.

thereto is concluded; or (B) the parties hereto will have received written notice from CFIUS that the Transactions do not constitute a Covered Transaction
(as such term is defined in 31 C.F.R. §800.213); (ii) if CFIUS has sent a report to the President requesting the President’s decision with respect to the
Transactions, that either (A) the President has announced a decision not to take any action to suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the
Transactions or (B) the time permitted under the DPA for the President to take action to suspend or prohibit the Transactions will have lapsed without any

sensitive or personal information, (B) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or its disclosure would violate the terms of
any confidentiality agreement or other contract that is binding on the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (C) disclosure of any such information or

third party to provide such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company and (3) in the case of clauses (A) and (C), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to

procedures, redaction (solely to the extent necessary) or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so
provided, if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable law or
jeopardizing such privilege. Any investigation or cooperation pursuant to this paragraph will be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company. All requests for information or cooperation made pursuant to the Merger Agreement will
be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such person as may be designated by any such executive officer.
To the extent Parent requests further information or investigation of the basis of any potential violations of laws relating to Sanctions and Export
Controls (as defined below), the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such request,
make available any personnel or experts engaged by the Company or its subsidiaries necessary to accommodate such request, and, if reasonably
requested by Parent, make submissions as promptly as practicable thereafter to governmental entities concerning such potential violations or to satisfy
obligations under laws relating to Sanctions and Export Controls (including, for the avoidance of doubt, self-classification reports to the U.S. Commerce
Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security), consistent with law, in consultation with Parent. Nothing in the Merger Agreement section pertaining to
access and consultation requires such cooperation to the extent it would, or would be likely to, (i) interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate the
Company’s or any such subsidiary’s constitutional documents or any applicable law, or (iii) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to bear any
out-of-pocket third party cost or expense or pay any fee (other than those costs and fees that Parent commits to reimburse).

Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties, against any and all costs (including settlement costs) or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to

Agreement to indemnify such person (and the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law; provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced will provide an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification). Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, will, for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
Indemnified Parties than are presently set forth in

the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or equivalent organizational and governing documents of any subsidiary). Any right of
indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to the Merger Agreement will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Party.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to,
obtain and fully pay for “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, “D&O Insurance”) with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Transactions) (the
“D&O Tail Policy”); provided, however that in no event will the cost of the D&O Tail Policy exceed three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premiums paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the D&O Insurance. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such “tail”
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of the Merger Agreement with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or the
Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement; provided,
however that in no event will the Company expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies, an annual premium
amount in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the D&O Insurance;
and, provided, further that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation will obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS",106,107
VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,APPRAISAL RIGHTS,"APPRAISAL RIGHTS
Under Delaware law, holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger, provided that such
holders meet all of the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If the Merger is completed, holders of record of shares of Vonage Common Stock
who continuously hold shares of Vonage Common Stock through the Effective Time who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who otherwise complied
with the applicable statutory procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section
262 of the DGCL.
The following is a brief summary of Section 262 of the DGCL, which sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This
summary, however, is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy of the text of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this
summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person having a
beneficial interest in shares of Vonage Common Stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to
cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to demand and perfect appraisal rights. If you wish to
consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL contained in Annex C and the information
below. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the
DGCL. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders should or should
not exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under the DGCL, if the Merger is effected, holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock who (i) did not cast their vote in favor of the Merger, (ii)
follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares of Vonage
Common Stock or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case, in accordance with the DGCL, will be entitled to have such shares of Vonage
Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment of the “fair value” of such shares of Vonage Common Stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by such court, together with interest, if
any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” could be greater than, less than or the same as the Merger
Consideration.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, Vonage is required not less than 20 days before the Special Meeting to vote on the Merger to notify each of the
holders of any class or series of its stock who are entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available for any or all of such shares of Vonage
Common Stock and is required to include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes a formal notice of appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights, or who wishes to
preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review the following discussion and Annex C carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with
the procedures specified may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.
Any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights should consider consulting legal counsel before attempting to exercise such rights.
If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL set forth in Annex C to this proxy
statement and consider consulting your legal advisor. If you fail to timely and properly comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, your
appraisal rights may be lost. To exercise appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Vonage Common Stock, you must:
 
 
1.
NOT vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock in favor of the Merger;
 
99Table of Contents
 
2.
deliver to Vonage a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Vonage Common Stock before the taking of the vote on the Merger
Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting, as described further below under “—Written Demand by the Record Holder”;
 
 
3.
continuously hold your shares of Vonage Common Stock through the Effective Time; and
 
 
4.
otherwise comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.",107,108
VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Written Demand by the Record Holder,"Written Demand by the Record Holder
As required by Section 262 of the DGCL, a demand for appraisal must be in writing and must reasonably inform Vonage of the identity of the record
holder and of such holder’s intention to seek appraisal of the holder’s shares of Vonage Common Stock. All written demands for appraisal should be
addressed to Vonage Holdings Corp., 23 Main Street, Holmdel, NJ 07733, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs Vonage of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of Vonage
Common Stock. The written demand must be received by Vonage prior to the vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal at the Special Meeting. Under
Section 262 of the DGCL, a proxy or vote against the Merger does not constitute such a demand.
The written demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the record holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock, fully and correctly, as such
holder’s name appears on the stock records of Vonage. If the shares of Vonage Common Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a
trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the shares of Vonage Common Stock are owned of record by
more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent,
including one of two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record. However, the agent must identify the record
owner(s) and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner(s).
Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal rights should consult with the record owner to determine the
appropriate procedures for having the record holder make a demand for appraisal with respect to the beneficial owner’s shares of Vonage Common Stock.
Any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights with respect to those shares of Vonage
Common Stock must take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record owner of the
shares of Vonage Common Stock.
If the shares of Vonage Common Stock are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares of Vonage Common
Stock through a central securities depository nominee, a demand for appraisal of such shares of Vonage Common Stock must be made by or on behalf of
the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as the record stockholder. Any beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights and holds shares of Vonage Common Stock through a nominee holder is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by
the record stockholder. The beneficial holder of the shares of Vonage Common Stock should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal
should be made by the record holder of the shares of Vonage Common Stock, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares of
Vonage Common Stock have been so deposited.",108,108
VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Filing a Petition for Appraisal,"Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the completion of the Merger, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation (which, in this case,
will be Vonage), or any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on Vonage in
the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair
 
100Table of Contents
value of the shares of Vonage Common Stock held by all holders who did not adopt the Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares of
Vonage Common Stock. If no such petition is filed within that one hundred and twenty (120)-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all dissenting
stockholders. Vonage is under no obligation to, and has no present intention to, file a petition, and holders should not assume that Vonage will file a
petition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of Vonage Common Stock. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the
holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares of Vonage Common
Stock within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the completion of the Merger, any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock who has complied
with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares of Vonage Common Stock not voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal have
been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares of Vonage Common Stock. Such statement must be mailed within ten (10) days after a
written request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands
for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of shares
of Vonage Common Stock, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Vonage Common Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf
of such person, and as to which demand has been properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for
appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.
Upon the filing of such petition by any such holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the
Surviving Corporation, which will then obligate the Surviving Corporation to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file with the Register in
Chancery of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Register in Chancery”) a duly verified list (the “Verified List”) containing
the names and addresses of all such stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares of Vonage Common Stock and with whom agreements as
to the value of their shares of Vonage Common Stock have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
order the Delaware Register in Chancery to provide notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving
Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the Verified List. Such notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or in another publication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
The costs of these notices are borne by the Surviving Corporation.
After notice to the stockholders as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the
petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder.
The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of Vonage Common Stock and who hold shares of Vonage
Common Stock represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of
the appraisal proceeding, and, if any such stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that
stockholder.
Determination of Fair Value",108,109
VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP_20220110_DEFM14A_19765909_4363201.Pdf,Determination of Fair Value,"Determination of Fair Value
After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding,
the Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of Vonage Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Court
of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good
 
101Table of Contents
cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent
(5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and
the date of payment of the judgment.
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., 457 A.2d 701 (Del.
1983), the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that
“proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered and that “fair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware
Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of Chancery must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects
of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 634 A.2d 345 (Del. 1993), the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a
“narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from
such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Vonage Common Stock as so determined could be more
than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, “fair value” under Section 262 of
the DGCL the completion of the Merger. Although Vonage believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of
the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery under Section 262 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor Vonage anticipates
offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and Parent and Vonage reserve the right to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of a share of Vonage Common Stock is less than the Merger
Consideration.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders
entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock whose name appears on the Verified List and, if such shares of Vonage Common
Stock are represented by certificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery,
may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery will
direct the payment of the fair value of the shares of Vonage Common Stock, together with interest, if any, by the Surviving Corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock, forthwith, and, in the case
of holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock represented by Certificates, upon the surrender to the Surviving Corporation of such stockholder’s
Certificates. The Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such Court may be enforced.
The costs of the action (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and imposed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may order
all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’
fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares of Vonage
Common Stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of an order, each party bears its own expenses.

Table of Contents
Any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal rights for shares of Vonage Common Stock in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not,
after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote such shares of Vonage Common Stock for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other
distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of shares of Vonage Common Stock as of a date or time prior to
the Effective Time.
Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger has become effective to each
stockholder that has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the Merger. At any time within sixty (60) days after the
Effective Time, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such
stockholder’s demand for appraisal only with the consent of Vonage. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within one
hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, stockholders’ rights to appraisal will cease, and all holders of shares of Vonage Common Stock
will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. In as much as Vonage has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention to do so,
any holder of shares of Vonage Common Stock who desires such a petition to be filed is advised to file it on a timely basis. Any stockholder may
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal by delivering to Vonage a written withdrawal of its demand for appraisal and acceptance of the Merger
Consideration, except that (i) any such attempt to withdraw made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of Vonage
and (ii) no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.
If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares of Vonage Common Stock in favor of the Merger, and you must comply
with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to take any required step in connection with the exercise of appraisal rights, it will
result in the termination or waiver of your appraisal rights.
The foregoing summary of the rights of Vonage stockholders to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not purport to be a complete
statement of the procedures to be followed by Vonage stockholders desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. A
copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement.
Failure to comply strictly with all the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal
rights. Consequently, if you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you are strongly urged to consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise your
appraisal rights.

If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of Vonage Common Stock in “street name,” your bank, broker, trust or other nominee
may have sent you a notice that your household will receive only one annual report and proxy statement or notice of internet availability of proxy for
each company in which you hold stock through that broker or bank. This practice, known as “householding,” is designed to reduce our printing and
mailing costs. If you did not respond that you did not want to participate in householding, the bank, broker, trust or other nominee will assume that you
have consented and will send only one copy of our proxy materials to your address.
You may opt-out of householding, or revoke your consent to householding, at any time thirty (30) days prior to the mailing of proxy materials by
sending your name, the name of your brokerage firm and your account number to the Corporate Secretary of Vonage at 23 Main Street, Holmdel, NJ 07733.
In any event, if you did not receive an individual copy of this proxy statement or if you wish to receive individual copies of our proxy statements, annual
reports or notices of internet availability of proxy, as applicable, for future meetings, we will send a copy to you if you write to or call our Corporate
Secretary at 23 Main Street, Holmdel, NJ 07733 or telephone: 212-871-3927. 
If you and other residents at your mailing address are registered stockholders and you received more than one copy of this proxy statement, but
you wish to receive only one copy of our annual report and proxy statement or notice of internet availability of proxy, you may request, in writing, that
Vonage eliminate these duplicate mailings. To request the elimination of duplicate copies, please write to our Corporate Secretary at 23 Main Street,
Holmdel, NJ 07733 or telephone: 212-871-3927.

Affiliate of the Corporation or of any such holder or beneficial owner (in all cases other than to the extent solely relating to or involving such intellectual
property rights of the Corporation and its subsidiaries), for any reason or in any way and whether or not by virtue of, in connection with or as a result of
the status of such holder, beneficial owner or affiliate as an affiliate of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise; provided, that the foregoing shall not
restrict the power, authority, ability and right of the Surviving Corporation to (i) grant or release rights, property, assets or claims that are owned or held
directly by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (and not by any of its Affiliates other than its Subsidiaries) or (ii) bind or assume liabilities or
obligations on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries (and not any of its Affiliates other than its Subsidiaries).

EXCHANGE
3.1 Effect on Capital Stock.
(a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any securities of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:
(i) Merger Consideration. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001, of the Company (the “Shares” and each a “Share”) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (y)
Shares owned by the Company as treasury stock (each such Share referred to in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), an “Excluded Share” and, collectively,
the “Excluded Shares”), and (z) Shares held by stockholders who shall not have voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (as may be amended)
and who shall have properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (each a “Dissenting Share”
and, collectively, the “Dissenting Shares”) shall be converted into the right to receive $21.00 per Share in cash, without interest thereon (the “Merger
Consideration”). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and (A) each certificate (a “Certificate”) formerly representing any of the Shares (other than the Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares) and (B) each book-entry account formerly representing any uncertificated Shares (“Uncertificated Shares”) (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender thereof in accordance with Section 3.2,
and each Certificate and Uncertificated Share formerly representing Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payment of
which reference is made in Section 3.3.
(ii) Cancellation of Excluded Shares. Subject to Section 3.3, each Excluded Share outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall
be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.
(iii) Expiration of Company Rights. All Company Rights, together with the associated Series A Participating Preferred Shares, outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall expire in their entirety without any payment being made in respect thereof in accordance with the
Preservation Plan Amendment.

3.2 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Paying Agent. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, on behalf of Merger Sub Parent, with
a paying agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”), for payment to the holders of Shares, an aggregate
amount of cash comprising approximately the amounts required to be delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(a) in respect of Shares (such aggregate amount of
cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that (i)
such investments shall be an obligation of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers’
acceptances of commercial banks and (ii) no such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders
of Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(a). To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any other
reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at
a level sufficient to make all cash payments required pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i). Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the
Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to effect the applicable terms of this Agreement.
(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the
conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)). Upon the
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such
transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in immediately available funds (or, if no wire
transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholding provided in Section 3.2(f)) equal to the
cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares represented by a Certificate
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued and/or
paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, reasonably
acceptable to the Paying Agent.
(c) Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of
Section 3.2(b)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all Shares will no longer be outstanding
and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any
Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor in accordance with
Section 3.1, or in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 3.3. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article III will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

Table of Contents
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parent’s option, to Parent.
Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for delivery of any payment of cash (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(f)) upon due surrender of
its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately prior
to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III (after giving effect to any Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(f)) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.
Parent or the Paying Agent, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration, may require the owners of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
(f) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any other applicable state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be timely remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. At least
fifteen (15) days prior to making any deduction or withholding pursuant to this Section 3.2(f) (other than any withholding in respect of Option Payments,
RSU Payments, PRSU Payments, Parent RSU Cash Awards, Parent PRSU Cash Awards or any other compensatory amounts payable hereunder, including
U.S. federal, state and local employment, wage or payroll tax withholding), Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, shall provide written notice to the Company of any anticipated deduction or withholding (together with the legal basis thereof) and shall
fully cooperate in good faith to reduce or eliminate any amounts that would otherwise be deducted or withheld.
(g) Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to (i) mail to each registered holder of Uncertificated Shares (other than in respect of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) materials
advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii)
deliver the cash that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of its Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (after giving effect to any Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 3.2(f)), without interest thereon.
3.3 Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Dissenting Shares shall be converted into the right to receive payment
of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article 
 
A-5
Table of Contents
III unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s right to appraisal under the
DGCL, and any holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such
Dissenting Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any Person who otherwise would be deemed to hold Dissenting Shares shall have failed to properly perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall finally
determine that such Person is not entitled to relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Shares, such Shares shall thereupon be
treated as though such Shares had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest and less
any required Tax withholding upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in
Section 3.2. The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice as promptly as practicable of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders’ rights of appraisal and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in any proposed strategy, decision, negotiation and proceeding with respect to demands for appraisal. Parent shall have
the right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
actions with respect to stockholders’ rights for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands or waive
any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any amounts required to be paid to a holder in
respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation.
3.4 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting the Company’s obligations under Section 6.1, in the event that the Company changes the
number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for any such Shares, in each case issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
subdivision, or other similar transaction (including the issuance of Shares pursuant to the terms of the Preservation Plan), the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event on the Merger Consideration.
3.5 Treatment of Equity Awards. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, or by Parent and the applicable holder, after consultation with the
Company, at the Effective Time each Company Equity Award shall be treated as follows:
(a) Treatment of Stock Options. Each option to purchase Shares (a “Company Option”) that was granted under the Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive
Plan, the Company’s Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and the Nexmo Inc. 2011 Stock Plan (collectively, the “Company Stock Plans”)
and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, (i) if the per Share exercise price of such Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall terminate and be cancelled, without any consideration being payable in
respect thereof, and have no further force or effect and (ii) if the per Share exercise price of such Company Option is less than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Option shall terminate and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 3.5(a), a lump sum cash
payment in the amount equal to (A) the number of Shares underlying the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price (the product of (A) and (B), the “Option Payment”). The Option Payment (if
any) payable under this Section 3.5(a) to each former holder of a Company Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
paid through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll to such former holder without interest and net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 3.2(f), as soon
as practicable following the Effective Date, but in any event not later than the first (1st) regular payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time; provided that if such first (1st) payroll date occurs fewer than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Option Payment
shall be paid no later than the second (2nd) regular payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.
 
A-6
Table of Contents
(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit that is or was subject to only timed-based vesting conditions (a “Restricted
Stock Unit”) that was granted under the Company Stock Plans and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall terminate and be cancelled in exchange for:
(i) with respect to Restricted Stock Units that become vested in accordance with their terms on or prior to the Effective Time but have not
yet been paid, the right to receive a lump sum cash payment in the amount equal to (A) the number of Shares underlying such Restricted Stock Unit,
multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration (each such payment, a “RSU Payment”); and
(ii) with respect to all other Restricted Stock Units, a new cash-based award representing the right to receive an unvested amount in cash
equal to (A) the number of Shares underlying such Restricted Stock Unit, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration, vesting, subject to the continued
employment of the former holder of such Restricted Stock Unit with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), on the same vesting
schedule (including with respect to any terms providing for acceleration of vesting) and otherwise on substantially the same terms as the corresponding
Restricted Stock Unit, except as otherwise provided for in this Section 3.5(b) (each such award, a “Parent RSU Cash Award”).
Following the Effective Time, no Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and each
former holder of any such Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive a RSU Payment or a Parent
RSU Cash Award as set forth in this Section 3.5(b) in exchange for such Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with this Section 3.5(b). The vested cash
amounts payable with respect to each portion of any RSU Payment or Parent RSU Cash Award shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll
to the former holder of the corresponding Restricted Stock Unit without interest and net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 3.2(f), as soon as
practicable following the applicable vesting date, but in any event not later than the first (1st) regular payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following
the applicable vesting date; provided that if such first (1st) payroll date occurs fewer than five (5) Business Days following the applicable vesting date for
any portion of a RSU Payment or Parent RSU Cash Award, the vested cash amounts with respect to such portion shall be paid no later than the second
(2nd) regular payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following the applicable vesting date. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, with
respect to any RSU Payments, the Closing Date shall be treated as the vesting date.
(c) Treatment of Performance Restricted Stock Units. Each performance restricted stock unit that is or was subject to performance-based vesting
conditions (each, a “Performance Restricted Stock Unit”) that was granted under the Company Stock Plans and is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall terminate and be cancelled in exchange for:
(i) with respect to Performance Restricted Stock Units with a performance period that ends on or prior to the Effective Time, the right to
receive a lump sum cash payment in the amount equal to (A) the number of Shares subject to such Performance Restricted Stock Unit that vested based
on the actual level of achievement under the awards, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration (a “PRSU Payment”); and
(ii) with respect to all other Performance Restricted Stock Units, a new cash-based award representing the right to receive an unvested
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of Shares subject to such Performance Restricted Stock Unit that would vest based on the actual level of
achievement as of the Effective Time compared against pro-rated performance measures as of the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration, vesting, subject to the continued employment of the former holder of such Performance Restricted Stock Unit with Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation), on the same time-based vesting schedule (including with respect to any terms providing for acceleration of
vesting) and otherwise on substantially the same terms as the corresponding Performance Restricted Stock Unit, except as otherwise provided for in this
Section 3.5(c) (each such award, a “Parent PRSU Cash Award”).
 
A-7
Table of Contents
Following the Effective Time, no such Performance Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding and each former holder of any such Performance Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive a PRSU Payment or Parent PRSU Cash Award as set forth in this Section 3.5(c) in exchange for such Performance Restricted Stock Unit in
accordance with this Section 3.5(c). The vested cash amounts payable with respect to each portion of any PRSU Payment or Parent PRSU Cash Award
shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll to the former holder of the corresponding Performance Restricted Stock Unit without interest
and net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 3.2(f), as soon as practicable following the applicable vesting date, but in any event not later than the
first (1st) regular payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following the applicable vesting date; provided that if such first (1st) payroll date occurs fewer
than five (5) Business Days following the applicable vesting date for any portion of a PRSU Payment or Parent PRSU Cash Award, the vested cash
amounts with respect to such portion shall be paid no later than the second (2nd) regular payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following the
applicable vesting date. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to any PRSU Payment, the Closing Date shall be treated as the
vesting date.
(d) Further Action. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are reasonably necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.5.
3.6 Treatment of Convertible Notes.
(a) Subject to Sections 6.17(a) and 6.17(b), in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Indenture (the “Convertible Notes Indenture”), dated as
of June 14, 2019, between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (“Trustee”), relating to the Company’s 1.75% Convertible
Senior Notes Due 2024 (the “Convertible Notes”), at or after the Effective Time, each holder of Convertible Notes will be entitled, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Convertible Notes Indenture (as may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time), to:
(i) convert such holder’s Convertible Notes only into a right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash for each $1,000
principal amount of such Convertible Notes held by such holder equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the Conversion Rate (as defined in the
Convertible Notes Indenture and as may be adjusted for any Additional Shares (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture)) in effect on the
applicable Conversion Date (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes Indenture);
(ii) require the Surviving Corporation to repurchase such holder’s Convertible Notes (or any portion of principal amount thereof that is
equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof), for cash on a date specified by the Company in accordance with the Convertible Notes
Indenture at the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture); or
(iii) continue to hold such holder’s Convertible Notes, which, for the avoidance of doubt, following the Effective Time shall only be
convertible or exchangeable into cash as set forth in Section 3.6(a)(i) above.
(b) The Surviving Corporation shall satisfy and fulfill the relevant payment obligations to each holder of Convertible Notes described in Section
3.6(a) above as and when required by the terms of this Agreement and the Convertible Notes Indenture (as such Convertible Notes Indenture may be
supplemented in accordance with its terms and subject to Section 6.17(a) and 6.17(b)).
3.7 No Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date
on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with

full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and
officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

amended or superseded filing), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no material outstanding
or unresolved comments in comments letters from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company Reports. There are no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of

reporting, or (iii) any complaints regarding a material violation of accounting procedures, internal accounting controls or auditing matters relating to the

compliance matters, in each case that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related

present, in each case, in all material respects, the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit
adjustments that are not or will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein or in the notes thereto. Since the Applicable Date, the Company and each of its officers and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, each of its directors, have been and are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

6.2 Acquisition Proposals.
(a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and shall instruct and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their
respective investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate or assist any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
regarding any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) provide any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person
access to the business, properties, assets, books, record or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in any such case with the intent to knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate or
assist any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (iv)
approve, adopt, endorse, declare advisable or recommend (or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing with respect to) any proposal that constitutes

intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other Contract (whether binding or non-
binding, oral or written, preliminary or definitive) relating to an Acquisition Transaction (any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other Contract, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”). The Company shall, and
the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions and negotiations

that the foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a Person to request the waiver of a “standstill” or similar obligation or from granting
such a waiver, in each case, to the extent both (1) permitting such request or granting such waiver is necessary for the Company’s board of directors to
comply with fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (2) such standstill or similar obligation prevents a confidential proposal from being made to the
Company’s board of directors. The Company shall not (i) except as provided in Section 4.13(b) or Section 6.21, terminate (or permit the termination of),
waive or amend, or grant any exemptions under, the Preservation Plan, (ii) redeem any Company Rights under the Preservation Plan or (iii) take any action

or delayed).

Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach, in any

material respect, of this Section 6.2, (i) provide access to non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who
made such Acquisition Proposal; provided that such information has previously been made available to Parent or is provided to Parent promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following the time such information is made available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such non-
public information, the Company receives from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as
restrictive in all material respects on such Person (including its Affiliates and Representatives) as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are on
Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition Proposal confidentially made
to the Company’s board of directors) (an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”) provided further, that competitively sensitive information provided to
any such Person who is a competitor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will only be provided in a separate “clean data room” and subject to
customary “clean team” arrangements regarding access to such information, and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company’s board of
directors determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that (A) based on the information then available and after consultation
with its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.
(c) Notice. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company receives or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, its Representatives receive, (i) any Acquisition Proposal or, (ii) any request by any Person for information or access
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any discussions or negotiation with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with the Company, and, in each instance, the Company shall indicate in such notice (A) the
identity of such Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal, (B) copies of any such Acquisition Proposal, Alternative Acquisition Agreement, request
made in writing and any other written terms and proposals provided (including financing commitments) to the Company or its Representatives, and (C) a
written summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in writing. The foregoing obligations on the part of the
Company shall apply with respect to any and all amended, revised or subsequent Acquisition Proposals and requests, and the Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of any material developments), of the status and terms of
any such proposals, offers or requests and the status of any such discussions or negotiations (including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to the price, form of consideration, and other material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to enter into any Contract with any Person that prohibits or otherwise limits the
Company from providing any information contemplated by this Section 6.2(c) to Parent or its Representatives or otherwise complying with its obligations
in this Section 6.2(c).
(d) No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except as permitted by Section 6.2(e) and Section 6.2(f), the Company’s
board of directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) adopt, approve, endorse, publicly propose, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement that is mailed to the Company’s stockholders or in any
other material press release or written communication to the Company’s stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, (iv) in the
event that (A) there is a publicly announced Acquisition Proposal, or (B) there is a public statement not in favor of the Merger made by a then-current
stockholder of the Company, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days following each written request by
Parent to the Company’s board of directors to do so (provided that Parent may make such a request no more than once in response to each publicly
announced Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that the amendment of the form or amount of consideration or any material term of an Acquisition
Proposal shall comprise a new Acquisition Proposal for this
 
A-31

purpose) and no more than once in response to each such public statement by such then-current stockholder), (v) fail to recommend against acceptance
of any tender or exchange offer for the Shares within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such offer or fail to maintain at any time such a
recommendation against such offer at any time before the expiration or withdrawal of such offer, or (vi) resolve, propose or agree, or propose to resolve or
agree, to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the actions described in clause (i) through (vi) of this Section 6.2(d), a “Change in Recommendation”).
(e) Superior Proposal Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.2(d), following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the date of this Agreement
that did not result from a breach, in any material respect, of this Section 6.2 and that the Company’s board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company’s board of directors may, at any time
prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, make a Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 6.2(e)(ii), in each case, only if all of the following conditions
are met:
(i) the Company shall have (A) as promptly as practicable, provided to Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice before
taking such action, which notice shall state expressly (1) that it has received a written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn and that the
Company’s board of directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (2) to the extent not previously provided to Parent pursuant to Section 6.2(c) (and without limiting the obligations under Section 6.2(c)), the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group making
the Acquisition Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided unredacted copies of all Alternative Acquisition Agreements, proposals and
other documents (including financing commitments) related to such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two (2) Business Day
period) and (3) that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company’s board of directors has determined to make a Change in Recommendation or to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.3(b) in order to enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
absent revisions to the terms of this Agreement, as applicable, (B) prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation or such termination in accordance
with Section 8.3(b), as applicable, engaged in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such four (4) Business Day notice
period (as it may be extended pursuant to this Section 6.2(e)(i)), which may be on a non- exclusive basis, to consider any adjustments proposed by Parent
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any revision to the amount or form of consideration or any other material term or condition of such Acquisition Proposal shall extend such
four (4) Business Day notice period for an additional two (2) Business Days (it being further understood and agreed that there may be multiple extensions
and that all notice obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.2(c) and this Section 6.2(e) shall apply with respect to each such revision of the
amount or form of consideration or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal)), and (C) complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 6.2; and
(ii) after the expiration of the notice period or periods under Section 6.2(e)(i), the Company’s board of directors shall have determined, in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, after taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent,
such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation or to so terminate
this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 8.3(b), as
applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement before this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with its terms, including payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 8.5(b).
(f) Intervening Event Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.2(d),
upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company’s board of directors may, at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, make a Change in Recommendation, only if all of the following conditions are met:
(i) the Company shall have (A) promptly provided to Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice before taking such action,
which notice shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail information describing the underlying material facts giving rise to the Intervening Event and the
rationale for the Change in Recommendation and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company’s board of directors has determined to
make a Change in Recommendation absent revisions to the terms of this Agreement, (B) prior to effecting such a Change in Recommendation, engaged in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such four (4) Business Day notice period to consider any adjustments proposed by
Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the failure of the Company’s board of directors to make a Change in Recommendation in
response to the Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (C) complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.2; and
(ii) after the expiration of the notice period or periods under Section 6.2(f)(i), the Company’s board of directors shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that in light of such Intervening Event and after taking into account
any revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
(g) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company’s board of directors from disclosing to the Company’s
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, if the
Company’s board of directors determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation
of applicable Law, it being understood that (i) any such disclosure made by the Company’s board of directors must be subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company’s board of directors and the rights of Parent under
this Section 6.2 and (ii) nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company’s board of directors to make a Change in
Recommendation other than in accordance with Section 6.2(e) and Section 6.2(f).

Statement”) in preliminary form relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
provide responses to the SEC and resolve, and each party hereto agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party in resolving, any comments
received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC. The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as
promptly as possible following the filing thereof with the SEC and in any event within seven (7) Business Days of the first to occur of (x) ten (10) calendar
days following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement if the staff of the SEC (the “Staff”) has not informed the Company that it will review the Proxy
Statement, or (y) the date the Staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement, as
the case may be, and shall take all necessary actions to set a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting
 
A-33

promptly (including conducting broker searches in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act, and setting a preliminary record date) to
accommodate such a mailing date.
(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement or any other SEC filing related to Parent, Merger Sub, their Affiliates or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such other SEC filing, an “Other Company Filing”) will be made by the Company without providing Parent
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (other than the disclosure of a Change in Recommendation in any filing, amendment or
supplement), and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments related thereto reasonably proposed by Parent or its counsel. The Company
shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all such filings, amendments or supplements to the extent not readily publicly available. In connection with
the Proxy Statement, Parent shall (i) furnish all information required by the Exchange Act or applicable Law concerning it and its Affiliates to the
Company, (ii) provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of information to be
included therein and (iii) otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any
comments received from the SEC. The Company agrees that all information related to Parent and its Affiliates included in the Proxy Statement or Other
Company Filing shall be in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Parent. If at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent which is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement such that the Proxy Statement would not (A) include any misstatement of
a material fact or (B) omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, then (x) the party that makes such discovery shall promptly notify the other party and (y) the Company
shall prepare (with Parent’s reasonable assistance) and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the Staff and of any request by the SEC or the Staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the Staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. No
response to any comments from the SEC or the Staff relating to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments reasonably proposed by Parent or its counsel
thereon. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with applicable Law, including the provisions of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the NASDAQ.
6.4 Company Stockholders Meeting.
(a) The Company will, as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Certificate of Incorporation and
Company Bylaws, and the rules of the NASDAQ, take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement (the “Company Stockholders Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite Vote. Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.2, the Company’s board of directors shall (i) include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) recommend at the Company
Stockholders Meeting that the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement and (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and solicit such
adoption. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis, and promptly upon Parent’s request, of the status of its
efforts to solicit and obtain the Company Requisite Vote. The Company shall permit Parent and its Representatives to attend the Company Stockholders
Meeting if requested by Parent in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on or before the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, the Company reasonably believes that (A) it will not receive proxies representing the Company Requisite Vote, whether or not a quorum is
present or (B) it will not have enough
 
A-34
Table of Contents
Shares represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may (and shall at the
reasonable request of Parent), in its reasonable discretion, postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the
Company Stockholders Meeting in consultation with Parent. In addition, notwithstanding the first and second sentence of this Section 6.4(a), the
Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental
or amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated in a manner suitable under applicable Law and reviewed by
stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company may not, without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or except as expressly required by an Order, postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting for a period of more than 10 Business Days on any single occasion or, on any occasion, to a date after the
earlier of (x) 60 Business Days after the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled and (y) 10 Business Days before the
Termination Date. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the matters contemplated by the Company Requisite Vote shall be the only matters (other
than matters of procedure and matters required by or advisable under applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection
therewith) that the Company shall propose to be voted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.
(b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption
at the Company Stockholders meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VIII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.
6.5 Filings; Other Actions; Notification and Cooperation.
(a) The Company and Parent shall, subject to Section 6.2, cooperate with each other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to use, their respective best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws and Orders to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date, including (i) preparing and filing all documentation to
effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings (and in any event, by filing within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement the pre-
merger notification and report forms required to be filed under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger, and as promptly as practicable in the case of all
other filings required under any Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby) and to obtain as expeditiously as possible all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) satisfying the
conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (iv) obtaining (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, approval of, waiver or any
exemption by, any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Merger and (v)
executing and delivering any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. The parties shall submit a declaration to CFIUS under 31 CFR § 800.402 and, only if requested by CFIUS under 31 CFR §
800.407, a joint voluntary notice.
(b) Subject to Section 6.5(c), in the event that the parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Laws, the parties will use their respective best efforts to submit as promptly as practicable, any additional information and documentary
material pursuant to such request and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate in connection with such response. None of the parties, including
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, shall knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken, or omit to take, any action which such party reasonably
expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of
 
A-35
Table of Contents
the contemplated transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Parent shall not, without giving the Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate and make any suggestions (to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by applicable Law), and the Company shall not, without
Parent’s prior written consent, (i) enter into any timing or settlement or similar agreement, or otherwise knowingly agree or commit to any arrangement,
that would have the effect of extending, suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the
contemplated transactions under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Laws, or (ii) enter into any timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to
any arrangement that would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the contemplated transactions (or that would otherwise prevent or prohibit the
parties from consummating the contemplated transaction).
(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all filings, notifications, communications,
submissions, and any other actions pursuant to this Section 6.5. No party hereto or its counsel shall independently participate in any substantive call or
meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws with any Governmental Entity in respect of such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without first giving the
other party or its counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and
participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) each party shall notify the other, as far in advance as
practicable, of any filing or material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries intends to make with any Governmental Entity
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Section 6.5, (ii) prior to submitting any such filing or making any such communication or inquiry, such
party shall provide the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in good faith the comments of the other party in
connection with, any such filing, communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the submission of such filing or making such communication or
inquiry, provide the other party with a copy of any such filing or, if in written form, communication or inquiry except to the extent the other party has
access to such filing, communication or inquiry, and (iv) consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with any
Governmental Entity relating thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation rights, the Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as promptly
as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be reasonably redacted as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns and Parent may redact from documents shown to the Company nonpublic information relating to
the businesses of Parent and its Affiliates.
(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 6.5, each of the parties hereto, including their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, hereto shall use its respective best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity in connection with the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to
avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this
Section 6.5, “best efforts” shall mean taking any and all actions (such actions, together with the actions required under Section 6.5(e), the “Regulatory
Actions”) necessary to obtain the consents, approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any Governmental Entity required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date,
including (A)(i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license, hold separate, and other disposition of the businesses, assets, products or equity interests of the Company or any of Parent’s other
businesses, assets, products or equity interests now owned or hereafter acquired by Parent, (ii) creating, terminating, or amending any existing
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, (iii) otherwise taking or committing to
any action that would limit the freedom of action of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to the operation of, or its
ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, products or equity interests of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
as applicable; provided, that such
 
A-36
Table of Contents
Regulatory Actions shall be conditioned upon and become effective only from and after the Effective Time; and (B) defending through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring prior to the Termination Date; provided further, that such litigation in
no way limits the obligation of Parent to, and to cause its controlled Affiliates to, use its best efforts, and to take any and all steps necessary, to eliminate
each and every such impediment so as to be able to close the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall have no obligation to litigate in any court to seek to vacate or terminate or avoid the entry of, any decree,
order or judgement under the DPA.
(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 6.5, but subject to the restrictions as described in
Section 6.5(f), if any administrative or judicial Proceeding, including any such Proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall
use its best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the
Merger; provided, that Parent shall bear fifty percent (50%) of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third party litigation fees and expenses
associated directly with contesting or resisting any such formal action or proceeding once instituted.
(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:
(i) subject to Section 6.5(c), Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all communications, meetings, negotiations and strategy
in connection with obtaining consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be
obtained from any third party or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead the defense strategy for dealing with any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding that is initiated or threatened to be initiated challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that
are brought by any Governmental Entity or relate to any Antitrust Laws; provided, that Parent shall consult in good faith with the Company in
connection with and throughout all such controlling and leading;
(ii) without the prior consent of Parent, the Company shall not undertake, or agree with or propose to any Governmental Entity or third
party to undertake, any Regulatory Actions;
(iii) without the prior consent of Parent, the Company shall not undertake, or agree with or propose to any non-governmental third party,
any action (including payments or entrance into or modification of Contracts) in connection with obtaining any consent or approval of, or waiver or any
exemption by, any non-governmental third party in connection with the Merger;
(iv) Parent shall not have any obligation to propose, undertake, or agree to any Regulatory Action if such Regulatory Action would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate with all other Regulatory Actions, result in a Substantial Detriment or if the effectiveness of
any Regulatory Action is not conditioned upon the Closing. “Substantial Detriment” means (A) in the case of Regulatory Actions necessary to obtain
the CFIUS Clearance, a material adverse impact on the Company (or the Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, Parent, or the pro
forma Parent (together with the Company and its Subsidiaries) (but assuming for this purpose that Parent or the pro forma Parent is the size, and has the
aggregate financial and operating metrics, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), including taking into account, for the avoidance of
doubt, any material impairment of the prospects or loss of the benefits and/or advantages reasonably expected to be received by Parent from the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (B) in the case of all other Regulatory Actions, a material adverse impact on the combined business of the
Company (or the
 
A-37
Table of Contents
Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiaries, Parent, or the pro forma Parent (together with the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole; and
(v) Parent’s obligations to take or cause to take any actions described in this Section 6.5, shall be subject, in each case, to the right of
Parent, in Parent’s good faith reasonable discretion, to take reasonable periods of time in order to advocate and negotiate with third parties and
Governmental Entities with respect to such actions.
(g) Information. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the other party that is necessary
or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be reasonably redacted as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns and
Parent may redact from documents shown to the Company nonpublic information relating to the businesses of Parent and its Affiliates.
(h) Status. The Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of any notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications.
6.6 Access; Consultation.
(a) Upon reasonable advance notice (and in any event not less than twenty-four (24) hours’ notice), and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law, (x) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall direct its and their Representatives to, afford Parent, its Subsidiaries and
the Financing Parties reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to the Company’s and its
Subsidiaries’ employees, properties, assets, books, records, Tax Returns and contracts and, (y) during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (1) furnish promptly to Parent, its Subsidiaries and the Financing Parties all information concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries’ capital
stock, business and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent or the Financing Parties in connection with the Merger or the Financing and (2)
cooperate reasonably with Parent in preparing for the transition and integration of the financial reporting systems of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
and with the financial reporting systems of Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, including by considering in good faith any comments
of Parent with respect to the Company’s preparation of financial statements; provided, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 or information
provided, made available or delivered to Parent, its Representatives or the Financing Parties pursuant to this Agreement shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company; provided further, that the foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any invasive
environmental sampling or similar invasive environmental inspection or to disclose any information pursuant to this Section 6.6, to the extent that (i) in
the reasonable and good faith judgment of the Company, any applicable Law or Order requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
access to any such information or disclosure thereof would expose the Company to an unreasonable risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information, (ii) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or its disclosure would violate the terms of any confidentiality
agreement or other Contract that is binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) disclosure of any such information or document would
result in the waiver or loss of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other legal privilege; provided further, that with respect to the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 6.6(a), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent of
any such third party to provide such disclosure, (B) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that is
reasonably acceptable to the Company and (C) in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), implement appropriate and
 
A-38
Table of Contents
mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of
appropriate clean room procedures, redaction (solely to the extent necessary) or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any
information to be so provided, if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating
applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. Any investigation or cooperation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be conducted in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company. All requests for information or cooperation made pursuant to this Section 6.6
shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by any such executive officer.
(b) To the extent Parent requests further information or investigation of the basis of any potential violations of Laws relating to Sanctions and
Export Controls, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such request, make
available any personnel or experts engaged by the Company or its Subsidiaries necessary to accommodate such request, and, if reasonably requested by
Parent, make submissions as promptly as practicable thereafter to Governmental Entities concerning such potential violations or to satisfy obligations
under Laws relating to Sanctions and Export Controls (including, for the avoidance of doubt, self-classification reports to BIS), consistent with Law, in
consultation with Parent; provided, that nothing in this Section 6.6(b) shall require such cooperation to the extent it would, or would be likely to, (A)
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
take any action that will conflict with or violate the Company’s or any such Subsidiary’s constitutional documents or any applicable Law, or (C) require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bear any out-of-pocket third party cost or expense or pay any fee (other than those costs and fees that Parent
commits to reimburse).
(c) The Company may, as it reasonably deems advisable and necessary to comply with applicable Law, designate competitively sensitive material as
“Outside Counsel Only Material” or with similar restrictions. Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
counsel of the recipient pursuant to a reasonable arrangement designed to assure compliance with Law and shall be subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.6, including all information and/or
discussions resulting from any access provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
(d) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 6.6 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.
(e) Each of the Company and Parent shall, after becoming aware, give prompt written notice to one another of (i) any change, effect, circumstance
or development that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), (ii)
any reasonably likely failure of any condition to Parent’s or the Company’s obligations to effect the Merger (as applicable), (iii) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Merger or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The failure
to provide notification under this Section 6.6 shall not affect the representations or warranties of the notifying party or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder.

6.7 Stock Exchange De-listing and De-registration. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part to cause the Shares to be de-
listed from the NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act, in each case, as soon as possible following the Effective Time.
6.8 Publicity. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to issuing or making, and provide each other the opportunity to review
and comment on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any filings with any third party or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except (a) as
may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any foreign or U.S. securities exchange or the
NASDAQ, (b) any consultation that would not be reasonably practicable as a result of requirements of applicable Law, (c) any press release or public
statement that in the good faith judgment of the applicable party is consistent with prior press releases issued or public statements made in compliance
with this Section 6.8 or (d) with respect to any Change in Recommendation made in accordance with this Agreement or Parent’s response thereto.
6.9 Employee Benefits.
(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to remain employed with the Company or its Subsidiaries
following the Closing (a “Continuing Employee”) shall, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Effective Time, be provided with (i) a base salary or base wage that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage provided to
such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities and
target long-term incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the target annual cash bonus opportunities
provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries for the year in which the Effective Time occurs and the target long-term
incentive compensation opportunities awarded to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the March annual grant period
immediately prior to the Effective Time (based on the closing price of a Share on the date of grant of such long-term incentive compensation
opportunities), and (iii) employee benefits (excluding severance) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that (A) Parent may provide any long-term
incentive compensation opportunities in the form of cash rather than equity and (B) no defined benefit pension, post-retirement welfare (other than any
obligations to reimburse for COBRA continuation coverage) or change in control or other non-recurring compensation or benefits provided prior to the
Effective Time shall be taken into account for purposes of this covenant. Additionally, Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Effective Time, be provided with severance benefits
that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time. This Section 6.9(a) shall not apply to any Continuing Employee who agrees in writing to a transfer of his or her employment to Parent,
or one of Parent’s Subsidiaries other than the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, and agrees to be brought onto Parent’s, or the applicable
Subsidiary’s, compensation and benefits offerings. Notwithstanding the proviso in clause (B) above, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor and assume all obligations under employment agreements and severance plans listed on Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination provisions in such agreements and
plans; provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not amend or terminate the terms of any such plans to the extent that such amendment or termination
would cause Parent to fail to comply with the first two sentences of this Section 6.9(a).
(b) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that no pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods shall apply to Continuing Employees under the benefit plans provided for those employees except to the extent such
condition or exclusion was applicable to an
 
A-40
Table of Contents
individual Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time. With respect to the plan year during which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Continuing Employee with credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent plan in which such Continuing Employee is eligible
to participate following the Closing Date.
(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide credit (without duplication) to Continuing
Employees for their service recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting, continuous
service, determination of service awards, vacation, paid time off, and severance entitlements to the same extent and for the same purposes as such service
was credited under the Company Plans, provided that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or for any purposes under any defined benefit pension plan, retiree welfare plan or long-term incentive or non-qualified deferred
compensation plan or arrangement.
(d) The Company shall promptly provide Parent with the most recent calculations and reasonable back-up information relating to Sections 280G and
4999 of the Code relating to the Merger, including any non-compete valuations, once such calculations and reasonable back-up information become
available following the date hereof and the Company shall provide updated calculations in the event there is a material change to any calculations
previously provided to Parent.
(e) Prior to making any broad-based communication or written communications directed to officers or employees of the Company that would create
a legally binding right to any future compensation on the part of a Continuing Employee, in each case, pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that
are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any schedules hereto), the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication and the Company shall consider
any such comments in good faith.
(f) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and neither any current or former employee, nor any
other individual associated therewith, is or shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9.8), no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, (i) constitute the
establishment of, or an amendment to, any Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, (ii)
alter or limit the ability of Parent to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) give

“Indemnified Parties”), against any and all costs (including settlement costs) or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, penalties or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or based on, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Person
prior to the Effective Time, in each case, whether threatened, pending or completed and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under the Laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to
which such Person is a party, the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such
Person (and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by final adjudication that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, shall, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnified Parties than are
presently set forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws (or equivalent organizational and governing documents of any

carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, “D&O Insurance”) with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby) (the “D&O Tail Policy”); provided, however that in no event shall the cost of the D&O Tail Policy exceed three-hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premiums paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the D&O Insurance. If the Company for any reason fails to
obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however
that in no event shall the Company expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies, an annual premium amount in
excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the D&O Insurance; and,
provided, further that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the

Person, then and in each such case proper provisions shall be made so that the successors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of
the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this Section 6.11.
(d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.11 shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have under
the Laws of the State of Delaware, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party, the Company Certificate of Incorporation or
the Company Bylaws, and Parent acknowledges and agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party pursuant to agreements made available to Parent in accordance with Section 9.11(b) for actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such settlement, compromise or consent.
(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to any directors’ and officers’
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.11 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.
6.13 Control of the Company’s or Parent’s Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly,

under the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

Antitrust Laws shall have been issued, enacted, rendered, promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable by any Governmental Entity that will expressly

(except for any representations and warranties that expressly relate to a particular date, which representation and warranty shall have been true and
correct in all material respects as of such particular date), except where the failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct (read
for purposes of this clause (b) without giving effect to any “materiality,” “Parent Material Adverse Effect” or similar qualification therein), individually or
in the aggregate, has not, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

respects all obligations required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth in

whether before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company referred to in Section 7.1(a), by mutual written consent of the
Company and Parent.
8.2 Termination by Either Parent or the Company. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the

Antitrust Laws), shall have been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted), or shall be capable of being satisfied at such time, then either the Company
or Parent may, in its respective sole discretion, elect to extend the Termination Date for a period of three (3) months (the “Extended Termination Date” and,
if so extended, the Extended Termination Date then shall be the “Termination Date”) by delivering written notice to the other party no later than such
then-scheduled Termination Date, it being agreed that there shall be no more than two (2) such extensions of the Termination Date (not to exceed twelve
(12) months after the date of this Agreement) pursuant to this Section 8.2(a); provided, further, however, that a party shall not be entitled to extend the

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any representation and warranty shall have become
untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or failure to
be true is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following notice to Parent from the Company of such breach or
failure and (ii) the Termination Date; provided, that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) if the
Company is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.2(a) and (b) shall not be satisfied; or
(b) at any time prior to the Company Requisite Vote being obtained, in order to concurrently enter into a definitive written Alternative Acquisition

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.4(a) if Parent is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
under this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a) or (b) shall not be satisfied; or
(b) (i) there shall have been a Change in Recommendation; or (ii) the Company shall have committed a Willful Breach under Section 6.2.

respective Related Parties); provided that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability (i) for damages resulting from the Willful
Breach prior to such termination by any party hereto or (ii) as provided in this Section 8.5 (including
 
A-51
Table of Contents
any obligation to pay, if applicable, (A) the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(c), (B) the No Vote Fee pursuant to Section
8.5(d) or (C) the CFIUS Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(e)).
(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b) (Change in Recommendation; Termination for Willful Breach of Deal
Protections) or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) (Termination for Superior Proposal), then the Company shall, within two (2) Business Days
after such termination in the case of clause (i) or concurrently with such termination in the case of clause (ii), pay to Parent (or its designee), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, a fee equal to $200,000,000 (the “Company Termination Fee”).
(c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (Termination Date) or Section 8.2(b) (Shareholder
Vote) or (B) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) (Company Breach), (ii) prior to such termination referred to in clause (i) of this sentence, but after the
date of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed by the Company or publicly made to the Company or shall
have been made directly to the Company’s stockholders generally and (iii) within twelve (12) months after the date of a termination in either of the cases
referred to in clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) of this Section 8.5(c), the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Transaction or
consummates any Acquisition Transaction, then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent (or its designee) upon the date of
consummation of such Acquisition Transaction (or, if such Acquisition Transaction is terminated before consummation, the consummation of any
subsequent Acquisition Transaction that was entered into in connection with the termination of such Acquisition Transaction); provided that solely for
purposes of this Section 8.5(c), all references in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” to “twenty percent (20%) or more” shall be deemed to be
references to “fifty percent (50%) or more”.
(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) (Shareholder Vote), then the Company shall pay Parent (or
its designee) $61,000,000 (the “No Vote Fee”), by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days following such termination by
Parent or concurrent with such termination by the Company; provided, that if the No Vote Fee is paid to Parent (or its designee), it shall be credited
toward, and shall reduce on a dollar for dollar basis the amount of, the Company Termination Fee payable under Section 8.5(c); provided, further, that
Parent shall not have the right to the No Vote Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5(d) if (i) Parent at the time of such termination is then in material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement and such material breach was the primary cause of the failure to
obtain the Company Requisite Vote. The existence of circumstances under Section 8.5(c) that could require the Company Termination Fee (less the No
Vote Fee previously paid to Parent (or its designee) by the Company) to become subsequently payable by the Company shall not relieve the Company of
its obligations to pay the No Vote Fee when payable under this Section 8.5(d) and the payment by the Company of the No Vote Fee shall not relieve the
Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee (less the No Vote Fee previously paid to Parent by the Company).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Termination Fee shall be payable by the Company in lieu of a No Vote Fee if
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and as of prior to such termination by the Company, Parent would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(b).
(e) If this Agreement is terminated
(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (Termination Date) and, as of the time of such termination, (A) the conditions set
forth in at least one of Section 7.1(b)(iii), Section 7.1(c) (as a result of a Law or Order relating to CFIUS) or Section 7.2(e) (as a result of the imposition of a
Substantial Detriment relating to CFIUS) shall have not have been satisfied or waived, (B) a material breach by the Company of this Agreement is not the
primary cause of one or more of the conditions in Section 7.1(b)(iii), Section 7.1(c) (as a result of a Law or Order relating to CFIUS) or Section 7.2(e) (as a
result of the imposition of a Substantial Detriment relating to

CFIUS) to not be satisfied and (C) all other conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2 have been satisfied or waived (and, in the case of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, such conditions
would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur),
(ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(c) (Injunctions) (as a result of a Law or Order relating to CFIUS) and, as of the time of
such termination, (A) a material breach by the Company of this Agreement is not the primary cause of such Law or Order and (B) all conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than the conditions set forth in Section
7.1(b)(iii), Section 7.1(c) (as a result of a Law or Order relating to CFIUS), Section 7.2(e) (as a result of the imposition of a Substantial Detriment relating to
CFIUS) and, if the Agreement is not yet eligible to be terminated under Section 8.2(b), Section 7.1(a)) have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waived (and, in the case of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, such conditions would be satisfied if
the Closing were to occur), or
(iii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) due to a breach or failure to perform by Parent of its
covenants under Section 6.5 being the primary cause of one or more of the conditions in Section 7.1(b)(iii), Section 7.1(c) (as a result of a Law or Order
relating to CFIUS), or Section 7.2(e) (as a result of the imposition of a Substantial Detriment relating to CFIUS) not being satisfied, and as of the time of
such termination, (A) the conditions in Section 7.1(b)(iii), Section 7.1(c) (as a result of a Law or Order relating to CFIUS), or Section 7.2(e) (as a result of
the imposition of a Substantial Detriment relating to CFIUS) have not all been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived and (B) all conditions to
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1(b)(iii), Section 7.1(c) (as a result of a Law or Order relating to CFIUS), Section 7.2(e) (as a result of the imposition of a Substantial Detriment
relating to CFIUS) and, if the Agreement is not yet eligible to be terminated under Section 8.2(b), Section 7.1(a)) have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waived (and, in the case of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, such conditions would be
satisfied if the Closing were to occur),
then Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days following such
termination by the Company or concurrent with such termination by Parent, a fee equal to $200,000,000 (the “CFIUS Termination Fee”).
(f) The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that each of the Company Termination Fee, the No Vote Fee and the CFIUS Termination Fee, if, as
and when required pursuant to this Section 8.5, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that, together with
any amounts payable under Section 8.5(g), will compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in
no event shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee, the No Vote Fee or the CFIUS Termination Fee, as applicable, on
more than one occasion.
(g) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, no party would have entered into this Agreement; and accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay
promptly any amount that may become due pursuant to Section 8.5(b), Section 8.5(c), Section 8.5(d) or Section 8.5(e) (any such amount due, a
“Payment”), and, in order to obtain such Payment, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company or Parent, as applicable, for the applicable Payment, or any portion thereof, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to the other party
(or its designee) its costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Payment at
the prime rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such Payment was required to be paid from such date, plus
two percent (2%) through the date of full payment thereof.

remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or

remedy or relief to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance or other
equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, each of the Company and Parent shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now

ARTICLE VIII
The Corporation shall provide indemnification as follows:
 
 
a)
Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or
is a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or
has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation,
as a director, officer, partner, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an “Indemnitee”), or
by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,
partner, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines, ERISA
taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not
act in good faith and in a
 
A-71
Table of Contents
 
manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
 
 
b)
Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is
or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee
of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, partner, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) and, to the extent permitted by law,
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this paragraph (b) in respect of
any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent,
that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite
the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity
for such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
 
 
c)
Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article VIII, to the extent that an Indemnitee
has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
Article VIII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection
therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition
without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the
Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal
proceeding, an adjudication that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for
the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.
 
 
d)
Notification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitee’s right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the
Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity
will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the
Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal
counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense,
the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this paragraph (d). Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the
employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded
that there may be a conflict of
 
A-72
Table of Contents
 
interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit,
proceeding or investigation or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the
Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article VIII. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of
Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall
have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee
under this Article VIII for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected without its written
consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty or
limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s written consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay
its consent to any proposed settlement.
 
 
e)
Advance of Expenses. In the event of any threatened or pending action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives
notice under this Article VIII, any expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit,
proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter;
provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such
matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it
shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial
ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment. Any advances or undertakings to repay pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall be unsecured
and interest-free.
 
 
f)
Procedure for Indemnification. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (e) of
this Article VIII, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses
shall be made as soon as practicable after written demand by Indemnitee therefor is presented to the Corporation, and in any event within (i)
in the case of indemnification under paragraph (c) (Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party) or paragraph (e) (Advancement of
Expenses), 20 business days after receipt by the Corporation, of the written request of Indemnitee, or (ii) in the case of all other
indemnification, 45 business days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests
under this clause (ii), the Corporation (y) has assumed the defense pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Article VIII (and none of the
circumstances described in paragraph (d) of this Article VIII that would nonetheless entitle Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and
expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (z) determine, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 45 business day period
referred to above that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct. Such determination, and any determination that
advanced expenses must be repaid to the Corporation, shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the
Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (“disinterested directors”),
whether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not
a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the
extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.
 
 
g)
Remedies. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article VIII shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Article VIII
 
A-73
Table of Contents
 
that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee
has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification, or brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
Indemnitee’s expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred in connection with any action instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or
interpret its right to indemnification, in whole or in part, shall also be indemnified by the Corporation, regardless of whether Indemnitee is
ultimately successful in such action, unless as a part of such action a court having jurisdiction over such action makes a final judicial
determination (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed) that each of the material assertions made by
Indemnitee as a basis for such action was not made in good faith or was frivolous; provided, however, that until such final judicial
determination is made, Indemnitee shall be entitled under paragraph (e) of this Article VIII to advancement of expenses with respect to such
action.
 
 
h)
Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VIII, except as set forth in paragraph (g) of this Article VIII, the
Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article VIII, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the
proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is
subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the
Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.
 
 
i)
Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article VIII or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other
applicable laws shall adversely affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof
with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to
the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.
 
 
j)
Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory),
agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee’s official capacity and as to action
in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or
officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article VIII
shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing
indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article VIII. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent
authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other
persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article VIII.
 
 
k)
Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article VIII to indemnification by the Corporation for some or
a portion of the expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines, ERISA taxes or penalties or amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the
portion of such expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines, ERISA taxes or penalties or amounts paid in
settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.
 
A-74
Table of Contents
 
l)
Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan)
against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
 
 
m)
Savings Clause. If this Article VIII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liabilities, losses, judgments,
fines, ERISA taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable
portion of this Article VIII that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
 
 
n)
Definitions. Terms used in this Article VIII and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of the DGCL shall have the respective meanings
assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).
 
 
o)
Subsequent Legislation. If the DGCL is amended after adoption of this Article VIII to expand further the indemnification permitted to
Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

Board of Directors
Vonage Holdings Corp.
23 Main Street
Holmdel, NJ 07733
Members of the Board:
We understand that Vonage Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ), an entity organized
and existing under the laws of Sweden (“Parent”), and Ericsson Muon Holding Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the
effective time of the Merger, will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than shares
(a) owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, (b) owned by the Company as treasury stock, and (c) held by stockholders
who shall not have voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement (as may be amended) and who shall have properly exercised appraisal rights
in respect of such shares, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $21.00 per share in cash, without interest thereon (the “Merger
Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the “Holders”), is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such Holders.
For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement provided by you as of November 21, 2021 (the
“Draft Merger Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of
the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company,
including financial projections and operating data of the Company (the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we discussed the past and current
operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market
prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of
Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to
the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered
such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections,
we have been advised by the management of the Company, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters
covered thereby. We also have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Draft Merger Agreement,
without any modification, waiver or delay. We have also assumed that the final executed Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the
Draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed
Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits
expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without
independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the
Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a
portion of which has been earned, and a further portion of which will become payable upon rendering of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger
fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and
the Company or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in
the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Parent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to
receive compensation.
Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from
which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short
positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective
affiliates.
This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the
Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company
Common Stock will trade at any time.
Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of,
the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement by the Holders, and we express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.
