Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS,"QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following are some questions that you may have about the merger and the special meeting, and brief answers to those questions. We urge you to
read carefully the remainder of this proxy statement because the information in this section does not provide all of the information that might be
important to you with respect to the merger or the special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the documents incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement. Please see “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
What is the merger?
A:
JetBlue and Spirit have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 28, 2022 (which we refer to as the “merger agreement”).
Under the merger agreement, Sundown Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of JetBlue (which we refer
to as “Merger Sub”), will merge with and into Spirit, with Spirit continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
JetBlue, in a transaction we refer to as the “merger.” We entered into the merger agreement following the agreement with Frontier Group Holdings,
Inc. (which we refer to as “Frontier”) on July 27, 2022 to mutually terminate the Agreement and Plan of Merger we entered into with Frontier on
February 5, 2022. A copy of the merger agreement is included in this proxy statement as Annex A.
Q:
What will Spirit stockholders receive pursuant to the merger agreement and in the merger?
A:
If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Spirit (which we refer to as “Spirit common
stock”) (except for shares held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and
who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D (which we refer to as
“dissenting shares”), treasury stock, and shares owned by JetBlue, Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries), will be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash per share, without interest, equal to (such amount, the “merger consideration”) (i) $33.50
minus (ii) (A) $2.50 (which we refer to as the “approval prepayment amount”), to the extent paid following the adoption by the holders of common
stock of Spirit (who we refer to as “Spirit stockholders”) of the merger agreement at the special meeting (or, in the event that the closing of the
merger (which we refer to as the “closing”) occurs after the record date of, but before the payment date of, such approval prepayment amount, to
the extent payable after the closing), and (B) an additional per share prepayment amount calculated as the product of $0.10 (which we refer to as the
“additional prepayment amount”) and the number of additional prepayments paid in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement (or, in the
event the closing occurs after the record date of, but before the payment date of any such additional prepayment, to the extent payable after the
closing), not to exceed $1.15 per share, by JetBlue to Spirit stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement after December 31, 2022. If the
closing occurs during or later than January 2024, the total cash received by Spirit stockholders, including the approval prepayment amount and the
aggregate additional prepayment amounts, will increase over time up to a maximum of $34.15 per share in the event the transaction is consummated
on the outside date in July 2024.
Regardless of whether the merger is completed, in the event the Spirit stockholders adopt the merger proposal at the special meeting, JetBlue will
pay or cause to be paid the approval prepayment amount to Spirit stockholders as of the record date established by Spirit for the special meeting
within five business days following such Spirit stockholder approval (which payment, we refer to as the “approval prepayment”). In the event of
such stockholder approval, on or prior to the last business day of each month beginning after December 31, 2022, until the earlier of the closing or
termination of the merger agreement, JetBlue will also pay or cause to be paid the additional prepayment amount to Spirit stockholders as of a
record date not more than five business days prior to the last business day of such month (which additional payments, we refer to as the
“additional prepayments”). If the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances for failure to obtain U.S. antitrust regulatory clearance,
JetBlue will be required to pay (i) to Spirit, $70.0 million, and (ii) to the Spirit stockholders, the excess of (A) $400.0 million minus (B) the sum of the
approval prepayment and all additional prepayments previously paid by JetBlue to the Spirit stockholders.

Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
A:
We are delivering this document to you because it is a proxy statement being used by the board of directors of Spirit (which we refer to as the
“Spirit board of directors”) to solicit proxies of Spirit stockholders in connection with approval of the merger and related matters. This document
serves as the proxy statement for the special meeting of Spirit stockholders to be held virtually via live webcast on the Internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SAVE2022SM2, on October 19, 2022, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (which we refer to as the “special meeting”) and
describes the proposals to be presented at the special meeting.
This proxy statement contains important information about the merger and the other proposals being voted on at the special meeting. You should
read it carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed materials allow you to have your shares of Spirit common stock voted by proxy without attending
the special meeting. Your vote is important and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. The merger cannot be completed
unless, among other things, Spirit stockholders approve the merger proposal (as defined below).
Q:
What are Spirit stockholders being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
A:
Spirit is soliciting proxies from the Spirit stockholders with respect to the following proposals:
•
a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with
and into Spirit, with Spirit continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of JetBlue (which we
refer to as the “merger proposal”);
•
a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive
officers of Spirit that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (which we refer to as the “compensation proposal”); and
•
a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including adjournments to permit
further solicitation of proxies in favor of the merger proposal (which we refer to as the “adjournment proposal”).
Q:
How does the Spirit board of directors recommend that I vote at the special meeting?
A:
The Spirit board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the compensation proposal and “FOR”
the adjournment proposal.
Q:
How will the merger affect Spirit restricted stock unit awards and Spirit performance share awards granted in fiscal year 2022?
A:
Under the merger agreement, except with respect to Spirit performance share awards (each, a “Spirit PSU award”) granted pursuant to Spirit’s 2015
Incentive Award Plan (the “Spirit equity award plan”), each award of Spirit restricted stock units denominated in Spirit common stock (each, a
“Spirit RSU award”) granted pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
(which we refer to as the “effective time”) (including Spirit performance share awards denominated in Spirit common stock granted in fiscal year
2022 pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan (each, a “2022 Spirit PSU award”) and performance market stock unit awards denominated in Spirit
common stock granted pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan (each, a “Spirit MSU award”)), will be assumed by JetBlue and converted into, for
each share of Spirit common stock underlying the related Spirit RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time (treating for this purpose
any performance-based vesting conditions to which a 2022 Spirit PSU award or Spirit MSU award is subject as having been achieved based on
target performance as of immediately prior to the effective time), the right to receive an amount in cash that is subject to the same service vesting
schedule applicable to the related Spirit RSU award and is equal to the sum of:
(x) the merger consideration, plus
2
Table of Contents
(y) solely to the extent (1) the related Spirit RSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity
award plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit RSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity
award plan, in each case, to reflect the approval prepayment and (2) paid pursuant to the merger agreement, the approval prepayment
amount, plus
(z) solely to the extent the related Spirit RSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity
award plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit RSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity
award plan, in each case, to reflect any additional prepayment, any additional prepayment amounts not yet paid to the holder of such Spirit
RSU award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spirit and JetBlue have agreed that each Spirit RSU award and Spirit MSU award granted in fiscal years 2023 and
2024 pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by JetBlue and
converted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the related Spirit RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time, a JetBlue
restricted stock unit denominated in JetBlue common stock (each, a “JetBlue RSU award”) based on an adjustment ratio, subject to the same terms
and conditions (including the vesting schedule) that applied to the related Spirit RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time; provided,
however, that the JetBlue RSU award may be settled in cash or stock as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors of
JetBlue (the “JetBlue compensation committee”) in its sole discretion.
Q:
How will the merger affect Spirit performance share awards (other than 2022 Spirit PSU awards)?
A:
Under the merger agreement, each Spirit PSU award granted pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan (other than a 2022 Spirit PSU award and Spirit
MSU award) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will entitle the holder to receive, immediately prior to the effective time
and subject to the occurrence of the closing, the number of shares of Spirit common stock that are earned thereunder based on target performance
as of immediately prior to the effective time, in each case, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of whole months
elapsed from the first day of the applicable performance period until the closing and the denominator of which is equal to the total months in the
applicable performance period. Any shares of Spirit common stock so delivered in respect of a Spirit PSU award will be deemed to be issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, and will have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of:
(x) the merger consideration, plus
(y) solely to the extent (1) the related Spirit PSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity
award plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit PSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity
award plan, in each case, to reflect the approval prepayment and (2) paid pursuant to the merger agreement, the approval prepayment
amount, plus
(z) solely to the extent the related Spirit PSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity
award plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit PSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity
award plan, in each case, to reflect any additional prepayment, any additional prepayment amount not yet paid to the holder of such Spirit
PSU award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spirit and JetBlue have agreed that each Spirit PSU award granted in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by JetBlue and converted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the
related Spirit PSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time, a JetBlue RSU award based on an adjustment ratio, subject to the same terms
and conditions (including the vesting schedule) that applied to the related Spirit PSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time; provided,
however, that the JetBlue RSU award may be settled in cash or stock as determined by the JetBlue compensation committee in its sole discretion.

Q:
How will the merger affect Spirit warrants?
A:
Under the merger agreement, immediately prior to the effective time, (i) the Spirit warrants will be assumed by JetBlue and will be converted into
warrants exercisable for the merger consideration and (ii) JetBlue will assume the due and punctual performance and observance of each and every
covenant, agreement and condition of the Spirit warrant agreements, such that the JetBlue assumed warrants will continue to have, and will be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Spirit warrants immediately prior to the effective time. The exercise price of the Spirit
warrants will be adjusted in accordance with the Spirit warrant agreements to take into account the approval prepayment amount and the additional
prepayment amount, to the extent paid prior to closing.
Q:
How will the merger affect Spirit convertible notes?
A:
Under the indentures governing Spirit’s 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (which we refer to as the “2025 convertible notes”) and Spirit’s
1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (which we refer to as the “2026 convertible notes” and, together with the 2025 convertible notes, the
“Spirit convertible notes”), prior to the effective time, Spirit, JetBlue and the Spirit convertible notes trustee will execute supplemental indentures to,
among other things, (i) change each Spirit convertible note holder’s right to convert Spirit convertible notes for shares of Spirit common stock into
a right to convert Spirit convertible notes for the aggregate consideration paid per share pursuant to the merger agreement on and after the
effective date, and (ii) provide for JetBlue’s assumption of Spirit’s obligations under the Spirit convertible notes upon consummation of the merger,
in each case pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the Spirit convertible notes. At the effective time, (i) the Spirit convertible notes will
be temporarily subject to a cash repurchase option at par value plus accrued interest following the merger, (ii) holders of the Spirit convertible notes
may convert their notes for thirty-five trading days after the closing of the merger (as such period may be extended pursuant to the terms of the
indentures governing the Spirit convertible notes), and (iii) the conversion rates of the Spirit convertible notes may be temporarily increased
following the merger. The approval prepayment amount and the additional prepayment amounts will be payable in accordance with the terms of the
indentures governing the Spirit convertible notes.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Spirit will settle any conversions of Spirit convertible notes that occur prior to the effective time (i)
pursuant to “Physical Settlement” (as defined in the indenture governing the 2025 convertible notes) for any conversions of 2025 convertible notes
and (ii) pursuant to “Cash Settlement” (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 convertible notes) for any conversions of 2026 convertible
notes, in each case pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the Spirit convertible notes.
Q:
What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Spirit stockholders?
A:
The exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in the section entitled
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local
and non-U.S. tax laws. A U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of
merger consideration received by the U.S. holder and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Spirit common stock surrendered in
exchange therefor.
The tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders is not clear. The parties have agreed to
report the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders as amounts paid by JetBlue to, and for the benefit of, the
Spirit stockholders for U.S. federal income tax and all other applicable tax purposes. Assuming that this characterization applies, the approval
prepayment and the additional prepayments could be treated as merger consideration paid before the closing of the merger (with a corresponding
adjustment to the gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder when such U.S. holder sells or exchanges its shares of Spirit common stock); as gain
realized by a U.S. holder in respect of a separate right or obligation with respect to its shares of Spirit common stock (e.g., if
4
Table of Contents
the merger is not consummated or if a U.S. holder disposes of its shares before the closing of the merger); or potentially as ordinary income to the
U.S. holder. It is also possible that the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) could disagree with the above characterization and
seek to characterize the approval prepayment and/or the additional prepayments in a different manner.
A non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger unless the non-U.S. holder
has certain connections to the United States or Spirit is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. In light of the
uncertainty as to the tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders, there is a meaningful
possibility that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that holds shares of Spirit common stock beneficially owned by a non-U.S. holder may
withhold at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the approval prepayment and the additional
prepayments.
For further information, please see the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 114 of
this proxy statement.
All holders of Spirit common stock should consult their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger, the
approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to them in light of their particular facts and circumstances.
Q:
If I am a Spirit stockholder, should I send in my Spirit stock certificate(s) now?
A:
No. Please do not send in your Spirit stock certificate(s) with your proxy. If you are a stockholder of record with your shares held in certificated
form, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for how to send your share certificates to the paying agent, in connection with the
merger. See “The Merger Agreement—Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates.”
Q:
What should I do if I hold my shares of Spirit common stock in book-entry form?
A:
If the merger is completed and your shares of Spirit common stock are held in book-entry form through the Depositary Trust Company (which we
refer to in this proxy statement as “DTC” or in “street name” by a broker or other nominee), the cash proceeds will be deposited into your bank or
brokerage account without any further action on your part. If you are a stockholder of record with your shares held in certificated form or held
directly in your name in book-entry form other than through DTC, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions for returning such letter of
transmittal, and, in the case of holders of share certificates, how to send your share certificates to the paying agent, in connection with the merger.
The paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check for your shares after you comply with these instructions.
Q:
When and where will the special meeting take place?
A:
The special meeting will be held virtually via live webcast on the Internet on October 19, 2022, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The special meeting will be
held solely via live webcast and there will not be a physical meeting location. Spirit stockholders will be able to attend the special meeting online
and vote their shares electronically during the meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SAVE2022SM2 (which we refer to as the
“special meeting website”).
Q:
What do l need to do now?
A:
After you have carefully read this proxy statement and have decided how you wish to vote your shares of Spirit common stock, please vote your
shares promptly so that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting.

Table of Contents
Q:
How do I vote?
A:
You may vote by mail or follow any alternative voting procedure described on the proxy card. To use an alternative voting procedure, follow the
instructions on each proxy card that you receive.
The procedures for voting are as follows:
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a Spirit stockholder of record, you may vote at the special meeting. Alternatively, you may vote by proxy by signing, dating and
returning the proxy card, over the Internet or by telephone. Whether or not you plan to attend (via the Internet) the special meeting, we urge you to
vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. Even if you have submitted a proxy before the special meeting, you may still attend the special
meeting and vote via the Internet. In such case, your previously submitted proxy will be disregarded.
•
To vote by proxy over the Internet, follow the instructions provided on the proxy card.
•
To vote by telephone, you may vote by proxy by calling the toll-free number found on the proxy card.
•
To vote by mail, complete, sign and date the proxy card and return it promptly in the envelope provided. If you return your signed
proxy card to us before the special meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker, Bank or Other Agent
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Spirit common stock registered in the name of your broker, bank or other agent, you should have received
a voting instruction card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than from us. Simply complete and mail
the voting instruction card to ensure that your vote is counted. To vote (via the Internet) at the special meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from
your broker, bank or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker, bank or other agent included with these proxy materials, or contact your
broker, bank or other agent to request a proxy form.
Q:
How do I vote via the Internet or by telephone?
A:
You may vote by proxy by following the instructions provided on the proxy card. You may also vote by proxy by calling the toll-free number found
on the proxy card. Please be aware that if you vote over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access
charges, as applicable, for which you will be responsible. The Internet and telephone voting facilities for eligible stockholders of record will close at
11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 18, 2022. The giving of such a telephonic or Internet proxy will not affect your right to vote should you decide
to attend (via the Internet) the special meeting.
The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders’ identities, to allow stockholders to give their voting
instructions and to confirm that stockholders’ instructions have been recorded properly.
Q:
What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?
A:
The presence at the special meeting, in person (via the Internet) or by proxy, of holders of a majority in voting power of the Spirit common stock
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions will be
included in determining the number of shares present at the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
If you hold shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you may instruct
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares by following the instructions that the bank, brokerage firm or nominee provides to
you. If you do not provide
6
Table of Contents
voting instructions to your brokerage firm, your shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting will not be voted and will not
be treated as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
Q:
What is the vote required to approve each proposal at the special meeting?
A:
Merger proposal:
•
Standard: Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding
shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote on the proposal.
•
Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you attend the special meeting in person (via the Internet) and do not vote or if you submit a
proxy card on which you indicate that you abstain from voting, your abstention will count as a vote “AGAINST” the applicable proposal. If
you are a holder of shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting and you do not attend the special meeting in
person or return a proxy, or if you hold your shares in “street name” and you do not provide voting instructions to your brokerage firm,
your shares will not be voted and will not be treated as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. This will have the effect of a vote
“AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Compensation proposal:
•
Standard: Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the shares of Spirit common
stock which are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the compensation proposal.
•
Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you attend the special meeting in person (via the Internet) and do not vote or if you submit a
proxy card on which you indicate that you abstain from voting, your abstention will count as a vote “AGAINST” the applicable proposal. If
you are a holder of shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting and you do not attend the special meeting in
person or return a proxy, or if you hold your shares in “street name” and you do not provide voting instructions to your brokerage firm,
your shares will not be voted and will not be treated as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Assuming a quorum is present at the
special meeting, this will have no effect on the compensation proposal.
Adjournment proposal:
•
Standard: Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
Spirit common stock which are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the adjournment
proposal.
•
Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you attend the special meeting in person (via the Internet) and do not vote or if you submit a
proxy card on which you indicate that you abstain from voting, your abstention will count as a vote “AGAINST” the applicable proposal. If
you are a holder of shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting and you do not attend the special meeting in
person or return a proxy, or if you hold your shares in “street name” and you do not provide voting instructions to your brokerage firm,
your shares will not be voted and will not be treated as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Assuming a quorum is present at the
special meeting, this will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.
Q:
Why is my vote important?
A:
If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for Spirit to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special meeting and to receive the vote necessary to
complete the merger. The merger cannot be completed unless the merger proposal is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power
of all issued and
7
Table of Contents
outstanding shares of Spirit common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. Only Spirit stockholders as of the close of business on September 12,
2022 (which we refer to as the “record date”) are entitled to vote at the special meeting. The Spirit board of directors unanimously recommends that
the Spirit stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. In addition, your
failure to submit a proxy or vote at the special meeting, or failure to instruct your bank or broker how to vote, or abstention will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.
Q:
If my shares of Spirit common stock are held in “street name” by my bank or broker, will my bank or broker automatically vote my shares for
me?
A:
No. Your bank or broker cannot vote your shares without instructions from you. If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or
other holder of record, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting
instructions provided by the bank or broker. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Spirit, or by voting
over the Internet or by telephone, unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank, or other nominee. Your bank,
broker or other nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction form for you to use. A so called “broker non-vote” will result if your
broker, bank or other nominee returns a proxy but does not provide instruction as to how shares should be voted on a particular matter. Under the
current rules of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, brokers, banks or other nominees may use their discretion to vote “uninstructed”
shares (i.e., shares of record held by banks, brokers or other nominees, but with respect to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not
provided instructions on how to vote on a particular proposal) with respect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to
“non-routine” matters. All of the proposals currently expected to be voted on at the special meeting are non-routine matters under applicable stock
market exchange rules for which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote, and therefore it is not expected that there will be any broker
non-votes at the special meeting. Further, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of Spirit common stock on behalf of their customers
may not give a proxy to Spirit to vote those shares with respect to any of the proposals without specific instructions from their customers, as
brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on these matters. Failure to instruct your bank or broker how to vote
will have (i) the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal, (ii) no effect on the compensation proposal and (iii) no effect on the
adjournment proposal.
Q:
Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares via the Internet?
A:
Yes. All Spirit stockholders as of the record date, including stockholders of record and stockholders who hold their shares through banks, brokers,
nominees or any other holder of record, are invited to attend (via the Internet) the special meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend (via the
Internet) the special meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy over the Internet to ensure your vote is counted. Even if you have submitted a proxy
before the special meeting, holders of record of Spirit common stock may still attend the special meeting and vote via the Internet. In such case,
your previously submitted proxy will be disregarded.
Q:
Can I change my vote?
A:
Yes. If you are a holder of record of Spirit common stock as of the record date, you may change your vote at any time before your shares of Spirit
common stock are voted electronically at the special meeting by: (1) submitting another properly completed proxy over the Internet, by telephone or
by mail with a later date; (2) attending (via the Internet) the special meeting and voting online (simply attending (via the Internet) the special
meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy); or (3) delivering a written revocation letter to Spirit’s Secretary at 2800 Executive Way, Miramar,
Florida, 33025, which written revocation letter must be received by Spirit prior to the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name”
through a bank, broker, or other holder of record, you should contact your record holder to change your vote.

Table of Contents
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
If you receive more than one set of materials, your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts. In order to
vote all the shares you own, you must follow the instructions for voting on each proxy card that you receive by mail or email, which include
instructions for voting over the Internet, by telephone or by signing, dating and returning each proxy card.
Q:
Will Spirit be required to submit the merger proposal to its stockholders even if the Spirit board of directors has withdrawn, modified, or
qualified its recommendation?
A:
Yes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the special meeting, Spirit is required to submit the merger proposal to its stockholders even
if the Spirit board of directors has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation that Spirit stockholders adopt the merger agreement.
Q:
Are Spirit stockholders entitled to appraisal rights?
A:
Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of Spirit common stock who hold their shares through the effective time and do not vote their shares
in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and who comply fully with and properly demand appraisal for their shares under the applicable
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and do not otherwise withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Delaware law, have the right to seek
appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Spirit common stock, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, if the merger is completed. The
“fair value” of shares of Spirit common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more than, less than, or equal to the value
of the merger consideration that Spirit stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. Spirit
stockholders also should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration
payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, “fair value” under Section 262 of the
DGCL. Holders of Spirit common stock who wish to preserve any appraisal rights they may have, must so advise Spirit by submitting a written
demand for appraisal prior to the vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, and must not vote in
favor of the merger proposal and otherwise follow fully the procedures prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. For further information, see “The
Merger—Appraisal Rights in the Merger.”
Q:
When do you expect to complete the merger?
A:
JetBlue and Spirit expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2024. However, neither JetBlue nor Spirit can assure you of if or when the merger
will be completed. JetBlue and Spirit must obtain the approval of the merger proposal by the Spirit stockholders at the special meeting, and also
must obtain necessary regulatory approvals in addition to satisfying certain other closing conditions. For further information, see “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger,” beginning on page 107 of this proxy statement.
Q:
What happens if the merger is not completed?
A:
If the merger is not completed, Spirit stockholders will not receive any consideration for their shares of Spirit common stock in connection with the
merger, other than the approval prepayment amount and any additional prepayment amounts paid prior to the merger agreement being terminated
(assuming the merger proposal is approved). Instead, Spirit will remain an independent, public company and Spirit common stock will continue to
be listed and traded on the NYSE. In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, a termination fee may be required to be
paid by Spirit to JetBlue. Further, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, an expense reimbursement amount may be
required to be paid by Spirit to JetBlue. Upon the termination of the merger agreement by JetBlue because
9

of a material, uncured breach by Spirit of the merger agreement, Spirit will be required to pay JetBlue an amount equal to the sum of the approval
prepayment and all additional prepayments paid by JetBlue directly to the Spirit stockholders. Upon the termination of the merger agreement for
failure to obtain U.S. antitrust clearance, JetBlue will be required to pay (i) to Spirit, $70.0 million, and (ii) to Spirit stockholders, the excess of (A)
$400.0 million minus (B) the sum of the approval prepayment and all additional prepayments paid by JetBlue directly to the Spirit stockholders. See
“The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” for a complete discussion of the circumstances under which any such termination fee or expense
reimbursement amount will be required to be paid.

Spirit was founded in 1964 as Clippert Trucking Company, a Michigan corporation. It began air charter operations in 1990 and renamed itself Spirit
Airlines, Inc. in 1992. In 1994, Spirit reincorporated in Delaware, and in 1999 it relocated its headquarters to Miramar, Florida.
Spirit offers affordable travel to value-conscious customers. Its all-Airbus fleet is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States.
Spirit serves 85 destinations in 16 countries throughout the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean.
Spirit’s ultra low-cost carrier, or ULCC, business model allows it to compete principally by offering customers unbundled base fares that remove
components traditionally included in the price of an airline ticket. By offering customers unbundled base fares, Spirit gives customers the power to
save by paying only for the Á La SmarteTM options they choose, such as checked and carry-on bags, advance seat assignments, priority boarding
and refreshments. Spirit records revenue related to these options as non-fare passenger revenue, which is recorded within passenger revenues in its
consolidated statements of operations.

Merger Consideration (page 85)
If the merger is completed, each share of Spirit common stock (except for dissenting shares, treasury stock, and shares owned by JetBlue, Merger
Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries), will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash per share, without interest,
equal to (i) $33.50 minus (ii) (A) the approval prepayment amount, to the extent paid upon the adoption by Spirit stockholders of the merger
agreement at the special meeting (or, in the event that the closing occurs after the record date of, but before the payment date of, such approval
prepayment amount, to the extent payable after the closing), and (B) an additional per share prepayment amount calculated as the product of the
additional prepayment amount and the number of additional prepayments paid in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement (or, in the event
the closing occurs after the record date of, but before the payment date of any such additional prepayment, to the extent payable after the closing),
not to exceed $1.15 per share, by JetBlue to Spirit stockholders in accordance with the merger agreement after December 31, 2022. If the closing
occurs during or later than January 2024, the total cash received by Spirit stockholders, including the approval prepayment amount and the
aggregate additional prepayment amounts, will increase over time up to a maximum of $34.15 per share in the event the transaction is consummated
on the outside date in July 2024.
The merger agreement provides that each share of Spirit common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than
shares held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D, treasury shares and shares held by JetBlue,
Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.
Shares of Spirit common stock owned by holders entitled to demand and that have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with,
and who have complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL will be treated as described under “The Merger—Appraisal Rights in the
Merger” beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement. All shares of Spirit common stock that are held in the treasury of Spirit, or owned of record
by JetBlue, Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, will be cancelled and will cease to exist, with no payment being made
with respect thereto.
Treatment of Spirit Equity-Based Awards and Warrants (page 86)
Spirit RSU Awards and 2022 Spirit PSU Awards. The merger agreement provides that, except with respect to Spirit PSU awards, each Spirit RSU
award granted pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (including 2022 Spirit PSU
awards and Spirit MSU awards) will be assumed by JetBlue and converted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the related Spirit
RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time (treating for this purpose any performance-based vesting conditions to which a 2022 Spirit
PSU award or Spirit MSU award is subject as having been achieved based on target performance as of immediately prior to the effective time), the
right to receive an amount in cash that is subject to the same service vesting schedule applicable to the related Spirit RSU award and is equal to the
sum of:
(x) the merger consideration, plus
(y) solely to the extent (1) the related Spirit RSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity
award plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related
14
Table of Contents
Spirit RSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity award plan, in each case, to reflect the approval prepayment and (2) paid
pursuant to the merger agreement, the approval prepayment amount, plus
(z) solely to the extent the related Spirit RSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity award
plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit RSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity award plan,
in each case, to reflect any additional prepayment, any additional prepayment amounts not yet paid to the holder of such Spirit RSU award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spirit and JetBlue have agreed that each Spirit RSU award and Spirit MSU award granted in fiscal years 2023 and
2024 pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by JetBlue and
converted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the related Spirit RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time, a JetBlue
RSU award based on an adjustment ratio, subject to the same terms and conditions (including the vesting schedule) that applied to the related Spirit
RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time; provided, however, that the JetBlue RSU award may be settled in cash or stock as
determined by the JetBlue compensation committee in its sole discretion.
Spirit PSU Awards (Other than 2022 Spirit PSU Awards). The merger agreement provides that each Spirit PSU award granted pursuant to the Spirit
equity award plan (other than a 2022 Spirit PSU award and Spirit MSU award) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will
entitle the holder to receive, immediately prior to the effective time and subject to the occurrence of the closing, the number of shares of Spirit
common stock that are earned thereunder based on target performance as of immediately prior to the effective time, in each case, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of whole months elapsed from the first day of the applicable performance period until the
closing and the denominator of which is equal to the total months in the applicable performance period. Any shares of Spirit common stock so
delivered in respect of a Spirit PSU award will be deemed to be issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, and will have the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of:
(x) the merger consideration, plus
(y) solely to the extent (1) the related Spirit PSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity
award plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit PSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity
award plan, in each case, to reflect the approval prepayment and (2) paid pursuant to the merger agreement, the approval prepayment amount,
plus
(z) solely to the extent the related Spirit PSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity award
plan and no amount has been otherwise paid in respect of the related Spirit PSU award to the holder thereof under the Spirit equity award plan,
in each case, to reflect any additional prepayment, any additional prepayment amount not yet paid to the holder of such Spirit PSU award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spirit and JetBlue have agreed that each Spirit PSU award granted in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by JetBlue and converted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the
related Spirit PSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time, a JetBlue RSU award based on an adjustment ratio, subject to the same terms
and conditions (including the vesting schedule) that applied to the related Spirit PSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time; provided,
however, that the JetBlue RSU award may be settled in cash or stock as determined by the JetBlue compensation committee in its sole discretion.
Warrants. The merger agreement provides that, immediately prior to the effective time, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Spirit
common stock will be assumed by JetBlue and converted into a warrant exercisable
15
Table of Contents
for the merger consideration, and each such warrant will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
warrants prior to the effective time. The approval prepayment amount and the additional prepayment amount will be payable upon exercise of a Spirit
warrant if exercised following consummation of the merger.
For further information, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Spirit Equity-Based Awards and Warrants,” beginning on page 86 of this proxy
statement.
Spirit Convertible Notes (page 105)
Within the time periods required by the terms of the applicable indenture for Spirit’s 2025 convertible notes and 2026 convertible notes (which we
collectively refer to as the “convertible notes indenture”), Spirit agreed to take all actions required by, or all commercially reasonable actions
requested by JetBlue pursuant to and in compliance with, the convertible notes indenture to be performed by Spirit as a result of the execution,
delivery or performance of the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including (i) the giving of any
notices that may be required by the convertible notes indenture or reasonably requested by JetBlue, and (ii) delivery to the trustee, the holders of
Spirit’s convertible notes or other applicable person, as applicable, of any instruments, certificates, opinions of Spirit’s counsel or other documents
required by the convertible notes indenture or reasonably requested by JetBlue in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the
merger agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby or as otherwise required by, or reasonably requested by JetBlue pursuant to or in
compliance with, the convertible notes indenture. Spirit also agreed to deliver a copy of any such notice, instrument, certificate, opinion or other
document to JetBlue at least three business days (or such shorter period of time as may be required to comply with the terms of the convertible
notes indenture) prior to delivering such notice or entering into such other document or instrument, and to consider any reasonable comments
thereto proposed by JetBlue in good faith. Spirit and the surviving corporation will execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered, as
applicable), in accordance with the convertible notes indenture, supplemental indentures and any other documents or instruments as may be
requested by the trustee in connection with the execution of such supplemental indentures, in each case in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the trustee and Spirit, pursuant to and with such terms as required under the convertible notes indenture.
Prior to the effective time and without the written consent of JetBlue, Spirit will not take any action that would result in an adjustment to the
“Conversion Rate” (as defined in the convertible notes indenture) of Spirit’s convertible notes, other than in connection with the entry into or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Except as provided for in the merger agreement, prior to the Effective Time and without the written consent of JetBlue, Spirit will not amend the
convertible notes indenture. Prior to the effective time, Spirit will comply with all requirements of the convertible notes indenture. Following the
effective time, the surviving corporation will comply with all requirements of the convertible notes indenture.
Prior to the effective time, Spirit will settle any conversions of (i) Spirit’s 2025 convertible notes pursuant to “Physical Settlement” (as defined in the
applicable indenture) and (ii) Spirit’s 2026 convertible notes pursuant to “Cash Settlement” (as defined in the applicable indenture).
Financing (page 63)
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and the related transactions, including payment of related fees and
expenses, will be approximately $3.8 billion, which we expect JetBlue to fund in part through debt financing, as further described below.
16
Table of Contents
Pursuant to a second amended and restated debt commitment letter, dated July 28, 2022, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,
the debt commitment parties party thereto committed to provide to JetBlue, at the effective time of the merger, a senior secured bridge facility in an
aggregate principal amount of up to $3.5 billion. JetBlue may, at its option, reduce the committed amount of debt financing under the debt
commitment letter, so long as (i) the aggregate amount of the debt financing (as so reduced) is sufficient, together with any other sources of funds
available to JetBlue and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) JetBlue concurrently deposits
cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal to such commitment reduction into a segregated account which will be solely available to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The funding of the debt financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter under which the debt
financing will be provided. The obligation of the parties to complete the merger is not subject to a financing condition. However, the failure of
JetBlue to obtain the debt financing (or to secure alternative financing) could result in the failure of the merger to be completed.
For further information, see “The Merger Agreement—Financing” beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement.
Spirit Will Hold its Special Meeting on October 19, 2022 (page 25)
The special meeting will be held virtually via live webcast on the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SAVE2022SM2, on October 19,
2022, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. At the special meeting, Spirit stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following matters:
•
a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 28, 2022, as it may be amended from time to time, by and
between Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Spirit, with Spirit continuing as the
surviving corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of JetBlue;
•
a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Spirit’s named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger; and
•
a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including adjournments to permit
further solicitation of proxies in favor of the merger proposal.
The Spirit board of directors has fixed the close of business on September 12, 2022 as the record date for determining the holders of Spirit common
stock entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting.
As of the record date, there were 108,854,641 shares of Spirit common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting held by
approximately 69 holders of record. Each share of Spirit common stock entitles the holder to one vote at the special meeting on each proposal to be
considered at the special meeting.
For further information, see “The Spirit Special Meeting” beginning on page 25 of this proxy statement.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 114)
The exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in the section entitled
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and
non-U.S. tax laws. A U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of merger
consideration received by the U.S. holder and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Spirit common stock surrendered in exchange
therefor.
17
Table of Contents
The tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders is not clear. The parties have agreed to
report the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders as amounts paid by JetBlue to, and for the benefit of, the
Spirit stockholders for U.S. federal income tax and all other applicable tax purposes. Assuming that this characterization applies, the approval
prepayment and the additional prepayments could be treated as merger consideration paid before the closing of the merger (with a corresponding
adjustment to the gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder when such U.S. holder sells or exchanges its shares of Spirit common stock); as gain
realized by a U.S. holder in respect of a separate right or obligation with respect to its shares of Spirit common stock (e.g., if the merger is not
consummated or if a U.S. holder disposes of its shares before the closing of the merger); or potentially as ordinary income to the U.S. holder. It is
also possible that the IRS could disagree with the above characterization and seek to characterize the approval prepayment and/or the additional
prepayments in a different manner.
A non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger unless the non-U.S. holder has
certain connections to the United States or Spirit is, or was during the relevant period, a U.S. real property holding corporation. In light of the
uncertainty as to the tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders, there is a meaningful
possibility that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that holds shares of Spirit common stock beneficially owned by a non-U.S. holder may
withhold at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of the approval prepayment and the additional
prepayments.
For further information, please see the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 114 of
this proxy statement.
All holders of Spirit common stock should consult their own tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger, the
approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to them in light of their particular facts and circumstances.
Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 64)
In considering the recommendation of the Spirit board of directors with respect to the merger, Spirit stockholders should be aware that Spirit’s
directors and executive officers have interests in the merger, including financial interests, that may be different from, or in addition to, interests of the
Spirit stockholders generally. The Spirit board of directors was aware of and considered these interests during its deliberations of the merits of the
merger and in determining to recommend to Spirit stockholders that they vote for the merger proposal and thereby approve the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger (to the extent such interests existed at that time).
These interests potentially include, among others:
•
As holders of Spirit PSU awards (other than 2022 Spirit PSU awards), Spirit’s executive officers will be entitled to prorated vesting and
settlement of such awards;
•
Cash severance payments and/or other benefits under the Spirit executive severance plan (as defined below) that may be payable to
Spirit’s executive officers upon a qualifying termination in connection with the merger;
•
Retention bonuses in connection with the merger in order to retain and incentivize key employees during the period between the public
announcement of the merger and the closing of the merger; and
•
Continued indemnification and insurance coverage to the officers and directors of Spirit following the merger for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the merger.

For a more complete description of these interests, see the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger,” beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement.
Appraisal Rights in the Merger (page 77)
If the merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Spirit stockholders who continuously hold shares of Spirit common stock through the
effective time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who are entitled to and otherwise properly demand and
exercise, and do not effectively withdraw, fail to perfect or otherwise lose, their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to
seek an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the “fair value” of their shares of Spirit common stock (exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive, in lieu of the merger consideration, such fair value, together with
interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any. The amount determined to be fair value by the court will be determined as of the
effective time and could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration for Spirit common stock. Voting “AGAINST” or failing to
vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the
DGCL.
Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Spirit stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares or who wish to preserve their rights to
do so should review Annex D carefully and are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights since
failure to timely and fully comply with the procedures set forth therein will result in the loss of such rights.
To exercise appraisal rights, Spirit stockholders must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to Spirit before the stockholder vote is taken on the
merger proposal at the special meeting; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the merger proposal; (iii) continue to hold shares of Spirit
common stock of record through the effective time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In
addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Spirit unless certain stock ownership conditions are
satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy
statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced in Annex D to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Spirit common stock through a bank, broker or
other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 82)
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, both JetBlue and Spirit have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory
approvals necessary or advisable to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These approvals include approvals from,
among others, the U.S. Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”), the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”), the
U.S. Department of Transportation (which we refer to as the “DOT”), the Federal Aviation Administration (which we refer to as the “FAA”) and the
Federal Communications Commission (which we refer to as the “FCC”). JetBlue and Spirit plan to file applications and notifications to obtain the
required regulatory approvals.
Although neither JetBlue nor Spirit knows of any reason why it cannot obtain these regulatory approvals in a timely manner, JetBlue and Spirit
cannot be certain when or if they will be obtained. For more information, see “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,”

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 109)
In each case described below, the merger agreement may be terminated and the merger abandoned by action taken or authorized by the board or
boards of directors of the terminating party or parties. The merger agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of JetBlue and Spirit at
any time prior to the effective time of the merger. In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by either party if:
•
any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity has issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger, which order or other action has become final and non-appealable (which order the party
seeking to terminate the merger agreement has used its reasonable best efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable, subject to the
provisions of the merger agreement);
•
the effective time of the merger has not occurred on or before July 28, 2023 or, in certain circumstances, January 28, 2024 or July 24, 2024
(such applicable date, as determined pursuant to the merger agreement, which we refer to as the “outside date”); or
•
the required Spirit stockholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting.
The merger agreement may be terminated by Spirit if:
•
in connection with the Spirit board of directors causing Spirit to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a
superior proposal in accordance with the provisions in the merger agreement; or
•
there is: (i) an uncured inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or breach of any covenant of the merger agreement by JetBlue or
Merger Sub that would result in the failure of the conditions to the obligation of Spirit to effect the merger to be satisfied; (ii) Spirit has
delivered to JetBlue written notice of such inaccuracy or breach; and (iii) such inaccuracy or breach is not capable of cure or, if curable,
has not been cured in all material respects prior to the earlier of the outside date and thirty days after the notice of breach. Spirit cannot
terminate for this reason if it has breached any covenant such that the condition to the consummation of the merger relating to
performance of Spirit’s covenants is not satisfied or there is an uncured inaccuracy in any of Spirit’s representations and warranties
such that the condition to the consummation of the merger relating to the truth and accuracy of Spirit’s representations and warranties
is not satisfied.
The merger agreement may be terminated by JetBlue if:
•
at any time prior to the effective time of the merger: (i) the Spirit board of directors effects a change of board recommendation with
respect to the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger; (ii) Spirit enters into any alternative acquisition
agreement with a third party; (iii) the Spirit board of directors publicly recommends to its stockholders any acquisition proposal by a
third party; (iv) where an acquisition proposal has been publicly disclosed (other than by the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange offer), the Spirit board of directors fails to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the merger within ten business days after
JetBlue’s request; (v) where a tender or exchange offer is commenced, the Spirit board of directors fails to recommend against such
offer’s acceptance by Spirit stockholders of such proposal (including for these purposes, by taking any position contemplated by Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act other than recommending rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten business days of
the commencement of such proposal; or (vi) the Spirit board formally resolves to take or publicly announces its intention to take any of
the foregoing actions (we refer to these events as the “triggering events”); or
•
there is: (i) an uncured inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or breach of any covenant of the merger agreement by Spirit that
would result in the failure of the conditions to the obligation of JetBlue
21
Table of Contents
to effect the merger to be satisfied; (ii) JetBlue has delivered to Spirit written notice of such inaccuracy or breach; and (iii) such
inaccuracy or breach is not capable of cure or, if curable, has not been cured in all material respects prior to the earlier of the outside
date and thirty days after the notice of breach. JetBlue cannot terminate for this reason if it or Merger Sub has breached any covenant
such that the condition to the consummation of the merger relating to performance of JetBlue’s and Merger Sub’s covenants are not
satisfied or there is an uncured inaccuracy in any of their representations and warranties of JetBlue or Merger Sub contained in the
merger agreement such that the condition relating to the truth and accuracy of JetBlue’s and Merger Sub’s representations and
warranties is not satisfied.

Transaction Expenses and Termination Fee (page 110)
All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the merger is
consummated. However, Spirit must pay JetBlue a termination fee of $94.2 million (which we refer to as the “termination fee”) if:
•
Spirit terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement;
•
JetBlue terminates the merger agreement in connection with a triggering event; or
•
(i) the merger agreement is terminated (a) on the outside date, (b) because there is an intentional breach of Spirit’s covenant with
respect to non-solicitation or (c) because the required stockholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting or any adjournment
or postponement of the special meeting; (ii) prior to the date of the special meeting (or prior to the termination of the merger agreement
if there has been no special meeting) an acquisition proposal has been publicly announced and is not withdrawn; and (iii) at any time
on or prior to the first anniversary of the termination of the merger agreement, Spirit consummates any acquisition proposal or enters
into a definitive written agreement related to an alternative acquisition proposal that is ultimately consummated; provided that for
purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), the references to “20%” in the meaning of acquisition proposal are deemed to be references to “50%.”
In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by either JetBlue or Spirit because Spirit stockholder approval of the merger proposal is not
obtained at the special meeting, then Spirit will pay to JetBlue the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by JetBlue in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement up to $25.0
million (which we refer to as the “expense reimbursement”). Any payment of the expense reimbursement will reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, any
termination fee that becomes due and payable under the merger agreement. In addition, upon the termination of the merger agreement by JetBlue
because of a material, uncured breach by Spirit of the merger agreement, Spirit will be required to pay JetBlue an amount equal to the sum of all
amounts previously paid by JetBlue as part of the approval prepayment and additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders.
In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by either Spirit or JetBlue because (i) a governmental entity has issued an order or taken any
other action permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger under applicable U.S. federal competition laws, or (ii) the merger has not
occurred by the outside date solely because of the failure to satisfy the closing condition requiring (a) the waiting period applicable to the
consummation of the merger under the HSR Act to have expired or been terminated or (b) that no governmental entity has issued an
22
Table of Contents
order or taken any other action enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger under applicable U.S. federal competition laws, and that no applicable
competition law will be in effect making the merger illegal or preventing the consummation of the merger, and at the time of such termination all other
closing conditions have been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on such date of termination), then (i) JetBlue will
pay directly to the Spirit stockholders as of a record date that is five business days following the date of such termination the excess of (A) $400.0
million minus (B) the sum of all amounts previously paid by JetBlue as part of the approval prepayment and additional prepayments to the Spirit
stockholders, and will pay to Spirit a corresponding amount payable to the holders of Spirit restricted stock unit awards and performance share
awards, and (ii) JetBlue will pay Spirit a fee in the amount of $70.0 million in each case within two business days following the date of such
termination. However, none of the foregoing payments will be payable by JetBlue if the failure to satisfy the conditions described in this paragraph
is the result of a breach by Spirit of its obligations in the provisions described under “—Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings” and JetBlue would
have been entitled to terminate the merger agreement as a result of such breach under the terms of the merger agreement.

Delisting and Deregistration of Spirit Common Stock (page 77)

1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”).

instruction card to ensure that your vote is counted. To vote (via the Internet) at the special meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker,

Under NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of Spirit common stock in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares
typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However,
banks, brokers and other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters determined to be “non-
routine,” without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that are represented
at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker or nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares to vote on the particular
proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. If your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares of Spirit
common stock in “street name,” your broker, bank, or other nominee will vote your shares of Spirit common stock only if you provide instructions on how
to vote by filling out the voter instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee with this proxy statement.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy materials, including
annual reports, with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single copy of the documents addressed to those

companies. In accordance with these rules, only one set of documents will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless Spirit has
received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders.

At the special meeting, the Spirit stockholders will be asked to adopt the merger agreement. Holders of Spirit common stock should read this proxy
statement, including the annexes, carefully and in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of
the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.
After careful consideration, the Spirit board of directors unanimously adopted the merger agreement, authorized and approved the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined the merger agreement and the merger to be advisable and in the best interests of
Spirit and its stockholders. Please see “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Spirit Board of Directors” included elsewhere in
this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion of the Spirit board of directors’ recommendation.
The Spirit board of directors unanimously recommends that Spirit stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.
Proposal No. 2 — Compensation Proposal",37,37
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Proposal No. 2 — Compensation Proposal,"Proposal No. 2 — Compensation Proposal
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act require that Spirit seek a non-binding advisory vote from its stockholders to
approve the “golden parachute” compensation that may be paid or become payable to Spirit’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger, as disclosed in “The Merger—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 64, including
the table titled “Merger-Related Compensation for Spirit’s Named Executive Officers” and its accompanying footnotes. As required by these provisions,
Spirit is asking the Spirit stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the adoption of the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Spirit’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case, as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Merger—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” and “The
Merger—Merger-Related Compensation for Spirit’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on pages 64 and 73, are hereby APPROVED on a non-
binding, advisory basis.”
The vote with respect to this proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Spirit, the Spirit board of directors, JetBlue, any of Spirit or JetBlue’s
subsidiaries or the combined company. Therefore, regardless of whether Spirit stockholders approve this proposal, if the merger agreement is adopted by
the Spirit stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise related to the merger will still be paid to Spirit’s
named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements. Approval of this
compensation proposal is not a condition to the closing of the merger.
The Spirit board of directors unanimously recommends that Spirit stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the compensation proposal.

Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Proposal No. 3 — Adjournment Proposal,"Proposal No. 3 — Adjournment Proposal
The special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit, among other things, further solicitation of proxies if
necessary to obtain additional votes in favor of the merger proposal.
If, at the special meeting, (i) there are insufficient shares of Spirit common stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, (ii) additional time is required for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which Spirit has determined is
29Table of Contents
reasonably likely to be required under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by Spirit
stockholders prior to the meeting of Spirit stockholders, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies, if and to the extent Spirit
reasonably believes the number of shares of Spirit common stock present or represented and voting in favor of the merger proposal is insufficient to
approve such proposal or (iv) if required by law, Spirit may move to adjourn the special meeting. In accordance with the Spirit bylaws, a vote to approve
the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to adopt the merger proposal may be taken in the absence of a quorum, and the meeting may also be adjourned at the discretion of the secretary
of the special meeting.
The Spirit board of directors unanimously recommends that Spirit stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Background of the Merger",41,41
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The Spirit board of directors and senior management regularly review and assess Spirit’s financial performance, prospects, competitive position and long-
term strategic plan with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. As part of this ongoing process, the Spirit board of directors and senior management
have periodically evaluated potential strategic alternatives relating to Spirit and its business and have engaged in discussions with third parties
concerning potential strategic transactions, including possible acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations and mergers.
On February 5, 2022, the Spirit board of directors unanimously approved and declared advisable the Frontier merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and resolved to recommend that Spirit stockholders vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement at a special
meeting of Spirit stockholders (the “Spirit-Frontier transaction special meeting”). During the same meeting, the compensation committee of the Spirit
board of directors (the “Spirit compensation committee”) unanimously approved the retention bonus program for certain key employees of Spirit in
connection with the Frontier merger agreement. Later on February 5, 2022, Spirit and Frontier executed the finalized merger agreement.
On March 29, 2022, Spirit received an unsolicited proposal from JetBlue to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Spirit common stock at a price of $33.00
per share (the “JetBlue proposal”), which proposal was subsequently provided to Frontier in accordance with the terms of the Frontier merger agreement.
33Table of Contents
On April 7, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit’s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Spirit’s legal
advisor, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP (“Debevoise”), and Spirit’s antitrust counsel, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul Weiss”), present,
held a video conference to review the JetBlue proposal. At that meeting, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, the Spirit
board of directors determined that the JetBlue proposal could reasonably be likely to lead to a “Superior Proposal,” as defined in the Frontier merger
agreement.
The Spirit board of directors directed Spirit’s senior management and its representatives to negotiate a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) with JetBlue
and to engage in discussions with, and provide non-public information to, JetBlue with respect to JetBlue’s proposal, in accordance with the terms of the
Frontier merger agreement. Spirit and JetBlue entered into an NDA on April 8, 2022 and commenced discussions regarding the JetBlue proposal on April
9, 2022.
Between April 9, 2022 and April 20, 2022, representatives of Paul Weiss conducted seven conference calls and video conferences with representatives of
JetBlue’s legal advisor, Shearman & Sterling LLP (“Shearman”), and engaged with economic consultants and economists in order to assess the regulatory
risk of an acquisition of Spirit by JetBlue and to assess the validity and merits of JetBlue’s own analysis.
On April 15, 2022, Spirit provided JetBlue and its representatives with access to a virtual data room containing due diligence materials for Spirit.
On April 19, 2022, members of senior management of Spirit and JetBlue, together with their respective financial advisors, held a video conference to
discuss a broad range of financial and business due diligence matters.
On April 21, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit’s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise
and Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to discuss the JetBlue proposal. The discussion focused primarily on Spirit’s regulatory concerns with
the transaction and the risks to Spirit’s business during the regulatory approval period. The Spirit board of directors directed Spirit’s senior management
and legal advisors to develop a proposal to convey to JetBlue in respect of the contractual protections that Spirit would need to address the regulatory
concerns identified by Spirit.
On April 24, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit’s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise
and Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to further discuss the JetBlue proposal. At that meeting, the Spirit board of directors instructed Spirit’s
senior management to communicate to JetBlue a package of contractual protections that the Spirit board of directors considered appropriate to provide
increased assurance as to the likelihood of regulatory approval of the JetBlue proposal and to protect Spirit and its stockholders against the risk that
such approval would not be obtained, which included a covenant to take all actions necessary to obtain regulatory approval, including being willing to
terminate JetBlue’s Northeast Alliance Agreement (the “NEA”) with American Airlines and make any divestitures necessary to obtain regulatory
approval, and a significant reverse termination fee payable in the event that such regulatory approval ultimately was not obtained. The Spirit board of
directors also instructed Spirit’s senior management to inform JetBlue that, in the event that Spirit ultimately concluded that the JetBlue proposal, as it
might be amended, constituted a “Superior Proposal” as defined in the Frontier merger agreement, Spirit would expect JetBlue to fund the termination fee
payable to Frontier upon termination of the Frontier merger agreement.
On April 25, 2022, Mr. Christie called Robin Hayes, JetBlue’s Chief Executive Officer, to convey the foregoing package of contractual protections.
Following that discussion, at the direction of Spirit, representatives from Barclays and Morgan Stanley held a call with representatives of JetBlue’s
financial advisor, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (“Goldman”), to discuss the same proposal, and representatives of Debevoise delivered to representatives of
Shearman a document setting forth Spirit’s proposal along with proposed language for the regulatory covenant that Spirit would expect to be included in
any definitive merger agreement with JetBlue.
34
Table of Contents
On April 29, 2022, JetBlue sent Spirit a letter setting forth its response to Spirit’s proposed package of contractual protections to address the regulatory
concerns identified by Spirit, along with a draft of the merger agreement. In that response, JetBlue offered (i) to pay a reverse termination fee of $200
million if U.S. antitrust approval was not obtained, (ii) to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory approvals subject to various
limitations, including that JetBlue would not be required to take any action that would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the
anticipated benefits of JetBlue or American Airlines under the NEA or that would have a material adverse effect on Spirit or JetBlue when measured
relative to a company of Spirit’s size, and (iii) to fund the termination fee payable to Frontier upon termination of the Frontier merger agreement.
On April 30, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit’s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise
and Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to discuss the JetBlue proposal, as modified by its April 29, 2022 letter. The Spirit board of directors’
discussion focused on the prospects that JetBlue would be able to obtain regulatory approval for its acquisition of Spirit, particularly in light of the
ongoing litigation regarding the NEA and the requirement of the Frontier merger agreement that, in order for Spirit to change its recommendation to
stockholders or to terminate such agreement to enter into a merger agreement with JetBlue, the JetBlue proposal must be “reasonably capable of being
consummated in accordance with the terms of such Acquisition Proposal, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal.” The Spirit board of directors also discussed the extended time that would be required to reach a final regulatory determination,
expected to be up to two years, and the risks to Spirit if it were unable to complete the proposed transaction with JetBlue at the end of that period.
Following adjournment, the Spirit board of directors continued its meeting on May 1, 2022. The directors, other than Mr. Christie, initially met in executive
session together with representatives of Debevoise, after which Mr. Christie, other members of Spirit’s senior management, and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Paul Weiss joined the meeting. Following further discussion with its advisors, the Spirit board of directors unanimously
determined that the JetBlue proposal did not constitute a “Superior Proposal” as defined in the Frontier merger agreement due to the regulatory concerns.
The Spirit board of directors did not form a view as to whether the economic terms of the JetBlue proposal were more favorable to the Spirit stockholders,
from a financial point of view, than the economic terms of the Frontier merger agreement.
The following morning, on May 2, 2022, Spirit sent a letter to JetBlue, which Spirit also released publicly, informing JetBlue that the Spirit board of
directors had determined that the JetBlue proposal did not constitute a “Superior Proposal” as defined in the Frontier merger agreement, on the grounds
that it did not adequately address regulatory concerns raised by a proposed combination with JetBlue, and stating that the Spirit board of directors
continued to believe that the pending transaction with Frontier represented the best opportunity to maximize value for the Spirit stockholders.
On May 16, 2022, JetBlue issued a press release announcing that it was commencing an unsolicited offer (the “Offer”), through its direct wholly owned
subsidiary Sundown Acquisition Corp., to purchase any and all of the issued and outstanding shares of Spirit common stock for $30.00 per share in cash,
without interest and less any required withholding taxes (the “Offer Price”), which was $3.00 less than the earlier JetBlue proposal. Shortly thereafter,
JetBlue filed with the SEC the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the “Schedule TO”) containing the Offer to Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal and
related documents. The Schedule TO provided that if a consensual transaction were reached with the Spirit board of directors and satisfactory diligence
information was provided to support the price increase, JetBlue would consider increasing the Offer Price to $33.00 per share.
Also on May 16, 2022, JetBlue filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC to be used to solicit proxies in opposition to the
proposed merger with Frontier and other related proposals at the Spirit-Frontier transaction special meeting.
During the evening of May 16, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit’s senior management, with representatives of Debevoise present,
held a video conference to discuss the Offer. Spirit also issued a press
35
Table of Contents
release that evening noting that the Spirit board of directors would review the Offer and intended to advise Spirit stockholders of its formal position
regarding the Offer within 10 business days by making available to Spirit stockholders and filing with the SEC a solicitation/recommendation statement on
Schedule 14D-9, and advised its stockholders to take no action at the time in response to the Offer.
Also on May 16, 2022, Spirit delivered a notice to JetBlue to return or destroy all confidential materials or information exchanged between the parties
pursuant to the NDA. In addition, Spirit revoked JetBlue’s and its advisors’ access to Spirit’s virtual data room. On May 26, 2022, JetBlue confirmed in
writing to Spirit that JetBlue had returned or destroyed all confidential materials or information received by JetBlue pursuant to the NDA.
On May 18, 2022, the Spirit board of directors and members of Spirit’s senior management, with representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise
and Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to discuss the Offer. Following discussion among the Spirit board of directors and its advisors, the Spirit
board of directors unanimously recommended that the Spirit stockholders reject the Offer and not tender their shares of Spirit common stock pursuant to
the Offer.
On May 19, 2022, Spirit filed with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 and issued a press release announcing that the
Spirit board of directors had unanimously determined to reject the Offer.
On June 1, 2022, Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”), a proxy advisory firm, published a report recommending that Spirit stockholders vote against
the adoption of the Frontier merger agreement, in large part on the basis that the Frontier merger agreement did not provide for Frontier to pay Spirit a
“reverse termination fee” in the event that the transaction did not receive antitrust approval. ISS contrasted that with JetBlue’s offer to pay a $200 million
reverse termination fee to Spirit if JetBlue’s proposed transaction was accepted by Spirit but could not be consummated as a result of the failure to obtain
antitrust approval.
Later on June 1, 2022, Mr. Christie spoke with William (“Bill”) A. Franke, chairman of the board of directors of Frontier, by telephone regarding the ISS
report and potential changes to the Frontier merger agreement to address the concerns raised by ISS, including the addition of a reverse termination fee
and potential changes to the merger consideration provided for in the Frontier merger agreement. Later on June 1, 2022, representatives of Debevoise sent
to representatives of Frontier’s legal advisor, Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham & Watkins”), a proposed draft of an amendment to the Frontier merger
agreement.
On June 2, 2022, Mr. Franke and Mr. Christie, respectively joined by other members of Frontier and Spirit management, spoke by telephone. On that call,
Mr. Franke informed Mr. Christie that the Frontier board of directors had met that morning and had authorized an amendment of the Frontier merger
agreement to provide for the payment by Frontier to Spirit of a reverse termination fee in the amount of $250 million if the transaction could not be
consummated as a result of the failure to obtain antitrust approval, but that the Frontier board of directors had not authorized any change to the merger
consideration. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Latham & Watkins sent to representatives of Debevoise a revised draft of the amendment to the
Frontier merger agreement that included the $250 million reverse termination fee.
Later on June 2, 2022, the Spirit board of directors met to consider the changes to the Frontier merger agreement proposed by Frontier, including the $250
million reverse termination fee. After discussion, the Spirit board of directors unanimously approved the proposed amendment to the Frontier merger
agreement.
Later on June 2, 2022, Spirit and Frontier finalized the amendment to the Frontier merger agreement and the parties executed the amendment.
On June 6, 2022, JetBlue sent the Spirit board of directors an updated proposal to acquire all of the shares of Spirit common stock containing the
following terms (i) an aggregate reverse break-up fee of $350 million payable in the event the requisite antitrust approvals are not obtained, (ii) a
prepayment of a portion of the
36
Table of Contents
reverse termination fee in the amount of $1.50 per share in cash, payable to Spirit stockholders as a cash dividend, which would be funded by JetBlue and
would be payable promptly following the later of the approval by the Spirit stockholders of a negotiated transaction with JetBlue and the termination of
the restrictions on the payment of dividends by Spirit imposed by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which
dividend would reduce the reverse termination fee payable by JetBlue to Spirit upon termination of the transaction in the event the requisite antitrust
approvals are not obtained, and (iii) in a negotiated transaction, total aggregate consideration of $31.50 per share in cash to the Spirit stockholders,
comprised of the prepayment dividend of $1.50 per share and $30.00 per share in cash payable upon consummation of JetBlue’s acquisition of Spirit.
JetBlue issued a press release and filed an amendment to the Schedule TO regarding JetBlue’s updated proposal. The amendment to the Schedule TO
provided that if a consensual transaction were reached with the Spirit board of directors and satisfactory diligence information was provided to support
the price increase, JetBlue would be willing to enter into a consensual transaction with Spirit on the terms described above.
Later on June 6, 2022, Mr. Christie spoke with Mr. Franke by telephone regarding the JetBlue’s June 6 proposal and potential changes to the Frontier
merger agreement that might be made in response to JetBlue’s updated proposal, including in particular an increase to the reverse termination fee.
Later on June 6, 2022, representatives of Citi spoke by telephone with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Citi informed
representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley that Frontier would not revise the Frontier merger agreement in response to JetBlue’s updated proposal.
Later on June 6, 2022, at the direction of Spirit, representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley spoke by telephone with representatives of Goldman
Sachs regarding JetBlue’s updated proposal in order to clarify the terms of that proposal.
Later on June 6, 2022, the Spirit board of directors, joined by members of Spirit management and representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise
and Paul Weiss, met to consider next steps in light of JetBlue’s updated proposal and Frontier’s declination to further revise the Frontier merger
agreement in response. After discussion, the Spirit board of directors unanimously determined to postpone the Spirit-Frontier transaction special meeting
from June 10, 2022. At the end of that meeting the Spirit board of directors met in executive session, joined by a representative of Debevoise, to further
discuss JetBlue’s updated proposal and next steps.
Shortly thereafter, representatives of Debevoise sent to representatives of Latham & Watkins a draft of a letter requesting Frontier’s consent under the
Frontier merger agreement to postpone the Spirit-Frontier transaction special meeting to June 30, 2022.
On June 7, 2022, an ad-hoc transaction committee of the Spirit board of directors, joined by members of Spirit management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Debevoise and Paul Weiss met to further discuss JetBlue’s updated proposal and the postponement of the Spirit-Frontier
transaction special meeting.
Later on June 7, 2022, Spirit sent to Frontier a letter requesting Frontier’s consent under the Frontier merger agreement to postpone the Spirit-Frontier
transaction special meeting to June 30, 2022, which consent was provided by Frontier.
Also on June 7, 2022, at the direction of Spirit, representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley held a videoconference with representatives from Citi to
discuss existing proposals from Frontier and JetBlue and communications strategy, and requested that Frontier submit a revised offer to Spirit by June 20,
2022.
On June 8, 2022, at the direction of Spirit, representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley spoke by telephone with representatives of Goldman Sachs
and requested a revised offer from JetBlue by June 20, 2022, outlining the following key items that Spirit would expect to be included in a potential
transaction with JetBlue (i) an
37
Table of Contents
improved economic offer representing the best price that JetBlue is prepared to pay, (ii) regulatory covenants, including a robust divestiture package, that
would provide sufficient assurance as to the ability to obtain antitrust approval, (iii) the ability of Spirit to operate its business in the normal course
during what Spirit expected to be a protracted regulatory review period, and (iv) an employee retention plan that took into account the additional time
period expected before the JetBlue transaction could be consummated. The representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley also explained that Spirit and
its advisors had agreed to provide the same Spirit-related information to JetBlue as was provided to Frontier and that a clean team agreement would need
to be entered into by certain representatives of JetBlue and its advisors in order to access certain highly confidential information or materials.
On June 9, 2022, representatives of Spirit, Paul Weiss, JetBlue and Shearman held a videoconference to discuss regulatory strategy, including potential
divestitures.
During June and July 2022, prior to the execution of the merger agreement, representatives of Shearman and Paul Weiss communicated about the potential
applicability of non-U.S. antitrust merger control filing requirements.
Also on June 9, 2022, representatives of Debevoise sent representatives of Shearman proposed language for the conduct of business covenant to be
included in any definitive merger agreement with JetBlue.
On June 10, 2022, Spirit restored access to its virtual data room for JetBlue and its advisors.
On June 14, 2022, Spirit issued a press release announcing that the Spirit board of directors would engage in further discussions with JetBlue with respect
to JetBlue’s updated proposal, and would also continue to work with Frontier under the terms of the Frontier merger agreement.
Between June 14, 2022 and June 16, 2022, members of the Spirit and JetBlue management teams held multiple due diligence calls focusing on written
questions delivered by JetBlue to Spirit on a variety of topics, including corporate strategy, financial and tax information, legal matters, aircraft fleet, and
human resources.
On June 17, 2022, Mr. Christie and Thomas Canfield, Spirit’s General Counsel, held a call with Mr. Hayes and Brandon Nelson, JetBlue’s General Counsel,
to discuss certain matters relating to employment and integration planning, as well as the process for the submission by JetBlue of a revised merger
proposal.
Later on June 17, 2022, Messrs. Christie and Canfield held a call with Mr. Franke, during which Mr. Franke stated that he was not inclined to increase the
reverse termination fee but was considering other elements of Frontier’s existing proposal, including potentially increasing the cash portion in exchange
for reducing the ownership interest of Spirit shareholders in the combined company. Also on June 17, 2022, at the direction of Spirit, representatives of
Barclays and Morgan Stanley held a telephone call with representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss the timing and process for JetBlue’s submission of
its revised proposal on June 20, 2022, and the anticipated process following the submission of JetBlue’s revised proposal.
Later on June 17, 2022, Spirit provided a copy of its proposed retention plan in the virtual data room accessible by representatives of JetBlue and

Table of Contents
On June 20, 2022, JetBlue sent Spirit a revised proposal and a revised draft of the merger agreement, which included (i) a price of $33.50 per share of
common stock of Spirit, (ii) a regulatory commitment to divest assets of JetBlue and Spirit up to a material adverse effect on JetBlue and its subsidiaries
(including Spirit), subject to various limitations including as to divestitures that JetBlue determined would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely
affect the anticipated benefits of the parties to the NEA, (iii) a reverse termination fee of $350 million, and (iv) a prepayment dividend of $1.50 per share in
cash to Spirit stockholders payable upon a vote of the stockholders approving a Spirit-JetBlue combination, which dividend would be funded by JetBlue
and would reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the price per share payable on the closing of the merger or the reverse termination fee in the event such fee
became payable upon the termination of the merger agreement. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Debevoise provided a copy of the JetBlue proposal
and its draft merger agreement to Frontier, as required under the Frontier merger agreement.

was discussing internally whether to propose to revise the terms to the Frontier merger agreement to (i) increase the cash portion of the merger
consideration by $2.00 per share, (ii) provide for a cash dividend to Spirit stockholders of approximately $250 million in total following a vote of the Spirit
stockholders approving a Spirit-Frontier merger, which dividend would be funded by Frontier and would reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the price per
share payable upon the closing of the merger or the reverse termination fee in the event such fee became payable upon the termination of the merger
agreement, (iii) increase the reverse termination fee from $250 million to $350 million, and (iv) reduce the number of board seats of the combined company
to be designated by Spirit from five to four. Mr. Bill Franke stressed that the foregoing terms were merely illustrative, did not constitute a firm proposal,
and remained under discussion within Frontier. That evening, representatives of Debevoise and Latham & Watkins discussed these same terms, and

agreement that had been discussed by Messrs. Christie, Franke and Franke. Following discussion among the Spirit board of directors and its advisors as

stockholders approving, and (iii) added a “ticking fee” dividend of $0.10 per share in cash per month payable starting in January 2023 through the
consummation of the JetBlue merger or termination of the merger agreement. The prepayment dividend and ticking fee dividends would be funded by
JetBlue and would reduce the per share merger consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis in an aggregate amount of up to $3.65 per share or the reverse
termination fee by up to $400 million in the event that fee was payable, but would be repayable by Spirit upon the termination of the merger agreement for
any other reason.

and Paul Weiss present, held a video conference to discuss JetBlue’s revised proposal. Following discussion among the Spirit board of directors and its
financial and legal advisors, the Spirit board of directors unanimously determined that JetBlue’s revised proposal did not adequately address the
regulatory concerns raised by a proposed combination with JetBlue, did not offer Spirit and its stockholders sufficient compensation in the event the
proposed transaction with JetBlue was not consummated, and did not deliver greater value to the Spirit stockholders than the Frontier merger agreement.

agreement and exchanged comments by email to certain provisions of the draft merger agreement, including the prepayments to Spirit stockholders, the

Debevoise and Shearman agreed that it would be feasible for JetBlue to make direct payments to Spirit stockholders (or their brokers) of the prepayment
amounts referred to in JetBlue’s revised proposal. JetBlue then proposed, through representatives of Shearman, that any definitive merger agreement
between JetBlue and Spirit provide for the direct prepayments by JetBlue to Spirit stockholders.

stockholders.

termination having the same effect as if the Frontier merger agreement were to be terminated following the failure of the Spirit stockholders to approve the
merger agreement. Representatives of Latham & Watkins subsequently discussed that proposal with representatives of Frontier and informed
representatives of Debevoise that Frontier was not willing to terminate the Frontier merger agreement on the terms proposed by Debevoise.

financial analyses provided to the Spirit board of directors in advance of the meeting (i) Barclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently
confirmed in writing) to the Spirit board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations, and assumptions
stated in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than the holders of the excluded
shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of shares of Spirit common stock, and (ii) Morgan
Stanley rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the Spirit board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common
stock (other than the holders of the excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of
Spirit common stock. The Spirit board of directors unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and resolved to recommend that Spirit stockholders vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
During the same meeting on July 27, 2022, the Spirit compensation committee unanimously approved a key employee retention bonus program pursuant
to which certain key employees of Spirit, including its executive officers, are eligible to receive a cash-based and, under certain circumstances, equity-
based retention award. For participants who are executive officers of Spirit, the retention award amounts generally range from 100% of a participant’s total
cash compensation (for Vice Presidents) to 150% of a participant’s total cash compensation (for Senior Vice Presidents and above). The cash-based
retention awards are generally payable in two installments: (i) 25% of a retention award will be paid on July 28, 2023 (or, if sooner, at the closing of the
merger), and (ii) the remaining 75% of a retention award will be paid within 30 days following the closing of the merger, in each case, subject to a
participant’s continued employment through the applicable payment date and, for executive officers, no sooner than April 2, 2023. If an executive officer’s
retention award exceeds 100% of the executive officer’s total cash compensation, then such excess amount will instead be payable in the form of
restricted stock units of Spirit that will vest in three equal annual installments (measured from the scheduled payment date of the cash-based portion of
the retention award), and be assumed by JetBlue as of the closing of the merger on the same terms and conditions. Further, Spirit may provide an
additional retention award to any participant, subject, where applicable, to approval of the Spirit compensation committee and JetBlue, the value of which
would be based on retention awards granted to similarly situated employees and the proportion of the expected retention period that has transpired. Any
such additional retention awards would be payable in accordance with the payment schedule described above, but no earlier than twelve months
following the date of grant, subject to continued employment through such payment date, and would be assumed by JetBlue as of the closing of the
merger. Participants would be entitled to 50% of their respective retention awards in the event the merger is not consummated, to be paid on the 30th day
following the termination of the merger agreement (or on April 2, 2023, if later).
Later on July 27, 2022, representatives of Debevoise and Shearman agreed to certain final revisions to Spirit’s disclosure schedules to the merger
agreement, and representatives of Paul Weiss and Shearman held a videoconference to discuss certain regulatory aspects of the merger.

Spirit Financial Forecasts
Other than limited short-term guidance concerning certain aspects of its expected financial performance which is publicly issued each quarter, Spirit does
not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other financial results given, among other reasons, the
uncertainty of realizing the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Spirit prepared certain unaudited prospective financial information (which
we refer to as the “Spirit Financial Forecasts”), that was provided to the Spirit board of directors in connection with their evaluation of the merger and to
Barclays and Morgan Stanley, financial advisors to Spirit, for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions described in the sections of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” and “The Merger—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.” The Spirit
Financial Forecasts were also provided to JetBlue and to Goldman, financial advisor to JetBlue. Select material line items for certain periods from the Spirit
Financial Forecasts, as well as material operating assumptions underlying such forecasts, are set forth below.
The Spirit Financial Forecasts were prepared based on the following key forecast assumptions:
•
Recovery. Unit revenue is assumed to stabilize at fuel-price adjusted pre-Covid-19 levels in mid-2023 with full capacity deployment delayed.
•
Revenue. Revenue is a reflection of current underlying demand assumptions, fuel price forecasts, and pace of Spirit’s return to full capacity
deployment.
•
Fuel Expense. Fuel pricing is based on the forward curve available as of mid-July 2022. No hedging activity is assumed.
•
Non-fuel Operating Expenses. Capacity growth is the primary driver, with additional increases driven by inflationary assumptions, as well
as additional labor costs estimated as of mid-July 2022.
•
Fleet Plan. Fleet plan is based on Spirit’s committed aircraft order book, with additional aircraft assumed in 2025-2026 to achieve stated mid-
teens growth target.
The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that any of JetBlue, Spirit, their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors
or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it necessarily to be predictive of actual future results, or
that it should be construed as financial guidance, and it should not be relied on as such. This information was prepared solely for internal use and is
subjective in many respects.

Important Information About the Spirit Financial Forecasts
The Spirit Financial Forecasts provide summary unaudited prospective financial information for Spirit. The Spirit Financial Forecasts were not prepared
with a view toward public disclosure and the inclusion of such Spirit Financial Forecasts should not be regarded as an indication Spirit, or any other
recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future results.
While presented with numeric specificity, the Spirit Financial Forecasts were not prepared for purposes of public disclosure, nor were they prepared on a
basis designed to comply with GAAP published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of projections. However, in the view of Spirit management, the Spirit Financial Forecasts were prepared on
a reasonable basis, and reflected the best estimates and judgments available at the time the Spirit Financial Forecasts were prepared, and present, to the
best of Spirit management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of Spirit. Neither Spirit’s
independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants, compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to
the Spirit Financial Forecasts summarized above, and has not expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on this information or its
achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the Spirit Financial Forecasts. The reports of the independent
registered public accounting firm incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relate to historical financial statements. They do not extend to any
financial projections and should not be seen to do so.
Although presented with numerical specificity, the Spirit Financial Forecasts were prepared in accordance with variables, estimates, and assumptions that
are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of Spirit, and which may prove not to have been, or to no longer be, accurate. While in the view
of Spirit management the Spirit Financial Forecasts were prepared on a reasonable basis, the Spirit Financial Forecasts are subject to many risks and
uncertainties. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from the Spirit Financial Forecasts include risks
and uncertainties relating to Spirit’s businesses, industry performance, the regulatory environment, general business and economic conditions, market
and financial conditions, various risks set forth in Spirit’s reports filed with the SEC, and other factors described or referenced in the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” of this proxy statement.
The Spirit Financial Forecasts also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and to conditions,
transactions or events that may occur and were not anticipated at the time the Spirit Financial Forecasts were prepared. In addition, the Spirit Financial
Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date the Spirit Financial Forecasts were prepared.
Accordingly, actual results will likely differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the Spirit Financial Forecasts. We do not assure you that
the financial results in the Spirit Financial Forecasts set forth above will be realized or that future financial results of Spirit will not materially vary from
those in the Spirit Financial Forecasts.

“Unlevered Free Cash Flows” is a non-GAAP measure defined as Adjusted EBITDAR less rent expense, less unlevered cash tax expense (taking
into account net operating losses and other differences between accounting tax expense and cash taxes paid), less change in net working capital,
less change in deferred heavy maintenance, less capital expenditures (including pre-delivery deposits for flight equipment, net of refunds, and
proceeds from sale of property and equipment), plus certain other non-cash expenses.

None of Spirit, or its affiliates, officers, directors, or other representatives gives any stockholder of Spirit, or any other person, any assurance that actual
results will not differ materially from the Spirit Financial Forecasts, and, except as otherwise required by law, none of them undertakes any obligation to
update or otherwise revise or reconcile the Spirit Financial Forecasts to reflect circumstances after the date the Spirit Financial Forecasts were generated
or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying the Spirit Financial Forecasts
are shown to be in error.
No one has made or makes any representation to any stockholder of Spirit, or anyone else regarding, nor assumes any responsibility for the validity,
reasonableness, accuracy, or completeness of, the Spirit Financial Forecasts set forth above. You are cautioned not to rely on the Spirit Financial
Forecasts. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Spirit board of directors, any of its advisors or any other
person considered, or now considers, it to be material or to be a reliable prediction of actual future results.
The Spirit Financial Forecasts included above cover multiple years, and this information by its nature becomes subject to greater uncertainty with each
successive year. The Spirit Financial Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information
contained in Spirit’s respective public filings with the SEC.
Due to the forward-looking nature of the Spirit Financial Forecasts, specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile any non-
GAAP measures presented to GAAP measures are not available. Spirit believes that there is a degree of volatility with respect to certain GAAP measures,
and certain adjustments made to arrive at the relevant non-GAAP measures, which preclude Spirit from providing accurate forecasted non-GAAP to
GAAP reconciliations.
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Spirit Board of Directors",53,55
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Spirit Board of Directors,"Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Spirit Board of Directors
In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and recommend its adoption by Spirit stockholders, the Spirit board of directors consulted
with management as well as Spirit’s financial, legal and other advisers, and also considered a variety of factors that the Spirit board of directors viewed
as supporting its decision, including, without limitation, the following:
•
that the Spirit board of directors believed that entering into the merger agreement with JetBlue was the best available strategic alternative for
Spirit given the termination of the previously proposed merger agreement between Spirit and Frontier following the failure of the Spirit
stockholders to approve that agreement;
•
that the proposed merger consideration represents a premium of 50.5% based on the 30-day volume weighted average prices of Spirit
common stock ending as of the close of trading on February 4, 2022, the last trading date unaffected by rumors related to a possible
transaction between Spirit and an acquirer; represents a premium of 37.9% to the closing price of Spirit’s common stock on July 27, 2022, the
last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement; and represents a premium of 48.5% to the closing price of Spirit
common stock on September 9, 2022, the last practicable trading date before the filing of this proxy statement, in each case, based on an
assumed merger consideration of $33.50 per share;
•
the expectation that the merger will create a more competitive and financially successful airline than Spirit would be able to create on a
stand-alone basis, including because the combined company would constitute the fifth largest airline in the U.S.;
•
that the proposed merger consideration consists solely of cash, and the merger agreement contemplates the prepayment of merger
consideration in certain circumstances, which provides immediate liquidity and primarily certainty of value to Spirit stockholders compared
to a transaction in which Spirit stockholders would receive shares of an acquirer’s stock, thus eliminating for Spirit stockholders the
uncertainty and risk of the continued execution of the Spirit business on a stand-alone basis or the combined company following the
completion of the proposed merger;

the oral opinions of each of Barclays and Morgan Stanley rendered to the Spirit board of directors on July 27, 2022, subsequently confirmed
in writing, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by each of Barclays and Morgan Stanley as set forth in their respective
written opinions, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than the holders of certain
excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of Spirit common stock,
each as further described in detail below under the sections entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” beginning on page 50
and “The Merger—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC” beginning on page 56;
•
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including:
○
Spirit’s ability to engage in negotiations with third parties regarding potential alternative acquisition proposals under certain
circumstances;
○
the Spirit board of directors’ right, after complying with the terms of the merger agreement, to terminate the merger agreement in order
to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including
payment of a termination fee to JetBlue of $94.2 million (approximately 2.5% of the aggregate consideration payable to Spirit
stockholders in the merger), which is within the customary range of termination fees payable in similar transactions and which, in the
view of the Spirit board of directors, taking into consideration the advice of its advisors, would not preclude a third party with both
the financial capability and strategic interest in Spirit from submitting a potential superior proposal;
○
the obligation of JetBlue to make a prepayment directly to Spirit stockholders of $2.50 per share following their approval of the merger
agreement, and to make additional prepayments of $0.10 per share per month commencing in January 2023 until the earlier of closing
and termination of the merger agreement, which prepayments in excess of an aggregate of $3.65 will represent additional consideration
to Spirit stockholders;
○
that such prepayments to Spirit stockholders are not contingent on the closing of the merger and that Spirit will have no obligation to
reimburse JetBlue for such prepayments if the merger is not consummated except in circumstances where the merger agreement is
terminated because of an uncured breach by Spirit of the merger agreement;
○
the amount of $70 million payable by JetBlue to Spirit, in addition to the amounts paid or payable directly to Spirit stockholders of not
less $400 million, if the merger is not consummated due to the failure to obtain U.S. antitrust approval or clearance;
○
the covenants contained in the merger agreement in respect of the efforts required by the parties to complete the merger;
○
the Spirit board of directors’ view that the merger agreement was the product of arm’s-length negotiations and contained customary
terms and conditions;
○
the fact that the merger would be subject to the approval of Spirit stockholders, and Spirit stockholders would be free to reject the
merger;
•
the fact that if Spirit stockholders so desire and if they comply fully with all of the required procedures under the DGCL, they will be able to
exercise appraisal rights with respect to the merger, which would allow such stockholders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery as further described in detail below under the section entitled “The Merger—Appraisal
Rights in the Merger” beginning on page 77; and
•
the course of negotiations between Spirit and JetBlue, which resulted in an increase of at least $0.50 from the price per share of Spirit
common stock initially offered by JetBlue, an increase of at least
48
Table of Contents
$270 million from the initial reverse termination fee offered by JetBlue, and additional flexibility for Spirit to operate its business during the
period between the execution of the merger agreement and the earlier of closing or termination thereof, and the Spirit board of directors’
belief, based on these negotiations, that this was the highest price per share and the highest reverse termination fee that JetBlue was willing
to pay, and that the terms of the merger agreement were the most favorable terms to Spirit to which JetBlue was then willing to agree.
The Spirit board of directors also considered the potential adverse impact of other factors weighing against its decision to approve the merger
agreement and recommend its adoption by Spirit stockholders, including, without limitation, the following:
•
the risk that the merger will not be completed as a result of the inability to obtain required antitrust approval or clearance;
•
Spirit will no longer exist as an independent company, and accordingly, Spirit stockholders will no longer participate in any future growth it
may have or any potential future increase in its value;
•
the risk that if the merger is not consummated, the trading price of Spirit common stock and the market’s perceptions of Spirit’s prospects
could be adversely affected;
•
potential unknown liabilities, liabilities that are significantly larger than Spirit and JetBlue currently anticipate, and unforeseen increased
expenses or delays associated with the merger;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Spirit’s business during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the completion of
the merger;
•
the risk that the terms of the merger agreement, including provisions relating to the payment of a termination fee under specified
circumstances, could have the effect of discouraging other parties that would otherwise be interested in a transaction with Spirit from
proposing such a transaction;
•
that litigation may occur in connection with the merger and that such litigation could prevent the merger or increase costs related to the
merger;
•
the possibility that Spirit stockholders might not approve adopt the merger and that, as a result, Spirit would be obligated to reimburse
JetBlue for its expenses, up to $25 million;
•
the time it may take for the merger to receive the required regulatory approvals, particularly while JetBlue is in active litigation with the DOJ
over the NEA;
•
Spirit’s management’s focus and resources may become diverted from other important business opportunities and operational matters while
working to implement the merger, which could adversely affect Spirit’s business;
•
the effect of a public announcement of Spirit entering into the merger agreement on Spirit’s operations and employees, Spirit’s ability to
retain key management, Spirit’s ability to effectively recruit replacement personnel if key personnel were to depart while the merger is
pending and the potential adverse effects on the financial results of Spirit as a result of any related disruption in Spirit’s business;
•
that the reverse termination fee is the sole remedy payable by JetBlue in the event that the merger agreement is terminated for failure to
obtain U.S. antitrust clearance, which may adversely affect Spirit’s ability to enforce, or JetBlue’s incentive to comply with, the regulatory
undertakings;
•
that there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the merger will be satisfied, or that the merger
will receive the required regulatory approvals, and as a result, the possibility that the merger may not be completed even if the merger is
approved by Spirit stockholders;
•
that if the merger is not completed, Spirit will have incurred significant risk and transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility
of disruption to Spirit’s operations, diversion of
49
Table of Contents
management and employee attention, employee attrition, and a potentially negative effect on Spirit’s business and customer relationships;
•
the interests that certain executive officers and directors of Spirit may have with respect to the merger, as described in the section entitled
“The Merger—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 64, which the Spirit board of directors
was aware of in connection with its evaluation of the proposed merger; and
•
that the receipt of the proposed merger consideration in exchange for Spirit common stock will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.
In addition, the Spirit board of directors also realized that there can be no assurance regarding future results, including results expected or considered in
the factors listed above. However, the Spirit board of directors concluded that the potential positive factors outweighed the risks and other potentially
negative factors associated with the merger.
In reaching its conclusion, the Spirit board of directors did not find it practical to assign, and did not assign, any relative or specific weight to the
different factors that were considered, and individual members of the Spirit board of directors may have given different weight to different factors. It
should be noted that the explanation of the reasoning of the Spirit board of directors and certain information presented in this section are forward-looking
in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.",55,58
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.,"Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.
Spirit engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor with respect to pursuing strategic alternatives for Spirit, including a possible sale of Spirit, pursuant
to an engagement letter dated November 21, 2019. On July 27, 2022, Barclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to
the Spirit board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the
consideration to be received by the stockholders of Spirit in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.
The full text of Barclays’ written opinion, dated as of July 27, 2022, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Barclays’ written opinion sets forth,
among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in
rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays’ opinion and the
methodology that Barclays used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
Barclays’ opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays’ Fairness Opinion Committee, is addressed to the Spirit board of directors, addresses
only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Spirit in the proposed transaction and does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Spirit as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed transaction or any other
matter. The terms of the proposed transaction were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Spirit and JetBlue and were unanimously
approved by the Spirit board of directors. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to Spirit or that any specific form of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the proposed transaction. Barclays was not requested to address, and its opinion does
not in any manner address, Spirit’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the proposed transaction, the likelihood of the consummation
of the proposed transaction, or the relative merits of the proposed transaction as compared to any other transaction in which Spirit may engage, including
the transaction set forth in the Frontier merger agreement (which we refer to as the “prior transaction”), which transaction Spirit advised Barclays had
been terminated. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature
of any compensation to any officers, directors or
50Table of Contents
employees of any parties to the proposed transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to the stockholders of
Spirit in the proposed transaction or otherwise. No limitations were imposed by the Spirit board of directors upon Barclays with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:
•
reviewed and analyzed a draft of the merger agreement, dated as of July 26, 2022, and the specific terms of the proposed transaction;
•
reviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning Spirit and JetBlue that Barclays believed to be relevant to Barclays’
analysis, including Spirit’s and JetBlue’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and Spirit’s and
JetBlue’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022;
•
reviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Spirit furnished to
Barclays by Spirit, including the Spirit Financial Forecasts;
•
reviewed and analyzed a trading history of Spirit common stock from July 26, 2017 to July 26, 2022, and a comparison of that trading history
with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
•
reviewed and analyzed published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance and price
targets of Spirit;
•
reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of Spirit with those of other
companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
•
had discussions with Spirit management concerning its business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects; and
•
has undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by Barclays
without any independent verification of such information (and had not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such
information). Barclays also relied upon the assurances of Spirit management that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Spirit Financial Forecasts, upon the advice of Spirit, Barclays assumed that such projections
were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Spirit management as to the future financial
performance of Spirit and that Spirit would perform substantially in accordance with such projections. Barclays assumed no responsibility for and
expressed no view as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not
conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of Spirit and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities
of Spirit. Barclays’ opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, July 27,
2022. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on events or circumstances that may occur after July 27, 2022.
Barclays assumed that the executed merger agreement will conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed by Barclays. In addition, Barclays
assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and all agreements related thereto. Barclays also
assumed, upon the advice of Spirit, that all material governmental, regulatory and third-party approvals, consents and releases for the proposed
transaction will be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the merger agreement and that the proposed transaction will be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof.
Barclays did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the proposed transaction, nor did Barclays’ opinion
address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood Spirit had obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from
qualified professionals.

Table of Contents
In connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as summarized below. In arriving at its
opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values to the shares of Spirit common stock but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Spirit in the proposed transaction on the basis of various financial and
comparative analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by it but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in
the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole, as
considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the process underlying its opinion.
Summary of Material Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to the Spirit board of directors. The summary of
Barclays’ analyses and reviews provided below is not a complete description of the analyses and reviews underlying Barclays’ opinion. The preparation
of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and review and
the application of those methods to particular circumstances, and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description.
For the purposes of its analyses and reviews, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Spirit, Barclays or any other parties to the proposed
transaction. No company, business or transaction considered in Barclays’ analyses and reviews is identical to Spirit or the proposed transaction, and an
evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies, businesses or transactions considered in Barclays’ analyses and reviews. None of Spirit, Barclays or any other person assumes responsibility
if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis or review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not
purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the companies, businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in,
and the results derived from, Barclays’ analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The summary of the financial analyses and reviews provided below includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
financial analyses and reviews used by Barclays, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full description of the
analyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of Barclays’ analyses and reviews.
Selected Comparable Company Analysis
In order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to provide a range of relative implied equity values per
share of Spirit by reference to those companies, which could then be
52
Table of Contents
used to calculate implied ranges, Barclays reviewed and compared specific financial and operating data relating to Spirit with selected companies that
Barclays, based on its experience in the airline industry, deemed comparable to Spirit. The selected comparable companies with respect to Spirit were:
•
Southwest Airlines Co.
•
Allegiant Travel Company
•
Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc.
•
JetBlue Airways Corporation
•
Frontier Group Holdings, Inc.
Barclays calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios of Spirit and the selected comparable companies. As part of its selected
comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and analyzed each company’s ratio of its current stock price to its projected earnings per share
(commonly referred to as a price earnings ratio, or P/E), and each company’s adjusted enterprise value to certain projected financial criteria (such as
revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent, or EBITDAR). The adjusted enterprise value of each company was
obtained by adding its short and long-term debt and operating leases to the sum of the market value of its common equity, the value of any preferred
stock (at liquidation value) and the book value of any minority interest, and subtracting its cash and cash equivalents. All of these calculations were
performed, and based on publicly available financial data and closing prices, as of July 26, 2022, for the selected comparable companies, the last trading
date prior to the delivery of Barclays’ opinion, and as of February 4, 2022, for Spirit, the last trading date prior to news reports of the prior transaction
(which we refer to as the “unaffected date”). The results of this selected comparable company analysis are summarized below:

Barclays selected the comparable companies listed above because their businesses and operating profiles are reasonably similar to that of Spirit.
However, because of the inherent differences between the business, operations and prospects of Spirit and those of the selected comparable companies,
Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected comparable company analysis.
Accordingly, Barclays also made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and
prospects of Spirit and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to
consider the results of the quantitative analysis. These qualitative judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels
and degree of operational risk between Spirit and the companies included in the selected company analysis. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the air transportation services industry, Barclays focused its analysis of the selected financial metrics to 2023E.
Based upon the analysis described above and its professional judgment, Barclays selected a range of 2023 estimated P/E multiples of 8.0x to 10.0x for
Spirit and applied such range to Spirit’s adjusted EPS, as set out in the Spirit Financial Forecasts, to calculate a range of implied prices per share of Spirit
common stock of $16 to $20. Based upon its professional judgment, Barclays also selected a range of 2023 estimated EBITDAR multiples
53
Table of Contents
of 4.0x to 5.0x for Spirit and applied such range to Spirit’s EBITDAR, as set out in the Spirit Financial Forecasts, to calculate a range of implied prices per
share of Spirit common stock of $7 to $17. Barclays noted that, on the basis of the selected comparable company analysis, the consideration to be
received by the stockholders of Spirit in the merger was above the 2023 estimated P/E range and above the 2023 estimated EBITDAR range.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
In order to estimate the present value of Spirit common stock, Barclays performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Spirit. A discounted cash flow
analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of
the asset. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts
by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other
appropriate factors.
To calculate the estimated enterprise value of Spirit using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays (i) added Spirit’s projected after-tax unlevered free
cash flows for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 through the end of fiscal year 2026 based on the Spirit Financial Forecasts to the “terminal value” of
Spirit as of December 31, 2026, and then (ii) discounted such amount to its present value using a range of selected discount rates. The after-tax unlevered
free cash flows were calculated by taking the projected total EBITDAR, adjusted for one-time or non-recurring items, and subtracting rent expenses,
unlevered cash taxes and capital expenditures and adjusting for the impact of depreciation and amortization, changes in working capital (including
changes in deferred heavy maintenance) and certain other non-cash expenses. The residual value of Spirit at the end of the forecast period, or “terminal
value,” was estimated by selecting a range of terminal value multiples based on estimated last twelve months EBITDAR (which we refer to as “LTM
EBITDAR”) for the period from April 1, 2022, to December 31, 2026, of 5.5x to 7.5x, which was derived by analyzing historical average LTM EBITDAR
multiples from selected comparable companies and applying such range to Spirit’s 2026 estimated LTM EBITDAR, as set out in the Spirit Financial
Forecasts. The range of after-tax discount rates of 10.5% to 12.5% was selected based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of Spirit and
the comparable companies. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Spirit by (A) (i) subtracting estimated total debt of $3.2 billion
and (ii) adding cash of $1.4 billion, each as of March 31, 2022, from the estimated enterprise value using the discounted cash flow method and (B) dividing
such amount by the fully diluted number of shares of Spirit common stock. These calculations resulted in a range of implied price per share of $26 to $55
(which we refer to as the “Spirit DCF range”). Barclays noted that the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Spirit in the merger was within
the Spirit DCF range.
Other Factors
Barclays also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial analyses in connection with rendering its advice, but
were references for informational purposes, including, among other things, the information described below under “—Historical Share Price Analysis”
and “—Research Analyst Price Targets.”
Historical Share Price Analysis
To illustrate the trend in the historical trading prices of Spirit common stock, Barclays considered historical data with regard to the trading prices of Spirit
common stock for the period from July 26, 2021 to July 26, 2022, and compared such data with the relative stock price performances during the same
periods of the S&P 500, the U.S. Global Jets ETF and the selected companies described above under “—Summary of Material Financial Analyses
—Selected Comparable Company Analysis.” Barclays noted that the closing price of Spirit common stock ranged from $16 to $29 during the 52-week
period ended July 26, 2022.
54
Table of Contents
Research Analyst Price Targets
Barclays reviewed, for informational purposes, as of July 26, 2022, the publicly available standalone price targets of Spirit common stock published by
equity research analysts associated with various Wall Street bulge-bracket and middle market brokers. The research analysts’ price target per share of
Spirit common stock ranged from $24 to $36 per share. The publicly available share price targets published by such equity research analysts do not
necessarily reflect the current market trading price for Spirit common stock and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including future financial
performance of Spirit and future market conditions. Research analyst price targets for Spirit were used for informational purposes only and were not
included in Barclays’ financial analyses.
General
Barclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings,
competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.
The Spirit board of directors selected Barclays because of its familiarity with Spirit and its qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions generally, as well as substantial experience in transactions comparable to the
proposed transaction.
Barclays is acting as financial advisor to Spirit in connection with the proposed transaction. As compensation for its services in connection with the
proposed transaction, Spirit paid Barclays a fee of $3 million upon the delivery of Barclays’ opinion and a fee of $3 million upon the delivery of Barclays’
opinion in connection with the prior transaction (together, referred to as the “opinion fees”). The opinion fees were not contingent upon the conclusion
of Barclays’ opinion or the consummation of the proposed transaction or the prior transaction. Additional compensation of $14 million will be payable on
completion of the proposed transaction against which the opinion fees will be credited. In addition, Spirit has agreed to reimburse Barclays for a portion
of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may
arise out of its engagement by Spirit and the rendering of Barclays’ opinion. Barclays has performed various investment banking services for Spirit and
JetBlue in the past, and may perform such services in the future, and has received, and would expect to receive, customary fees for such services.
Specifically, in the past two years, Barclays has performed the following investment banking and financial services: (a) for Spirit (i) having acted as a
financial advisor to Spirit in connection with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020; (ii) having acted as a structuring agent and
joint bookrunner on Spirit’s $850 million senior secured notes in September 2020; (iii) having acted as an underwriter on Spirit’s 2026 convertible notes in
April 2021; (iv) having acted as an advisor on Spirit’s registered direct offering and repurchase in April 2021; (v) having served as a lender under Spirit’s
existing revolving credit facility; and (vi) having provided advisory services to Spirit on its assessment of certain strategic alternatives, including the
prior transaction and (b) for JetBlue (i) having served as an active bookrunner on JetBlue’s approximately $800 million Enhanced Equipment Trust
Certificate offering in August 2020; (ii) having served as a joint-bookrunning manager on JetBlue’s offering of 41,975,000 shares in December 2020; (iii)
having served as an active bookrunner on JetBlue’s 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 in March 2021; and (iv) having served as a lender under
JetBlue’s existing revolving credit facility. During the period beginning January 1, 2020, through the date of rendering its opinion, the aggregate amount
of fees that Barclays received from Spirit and JetBlue for the investment banking and financial services was approximately $17.6 million and $15.3 million,
respectively.
Barclays, its subsidiaries and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial banking, lending, asset management and
other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of Barclays’ business, Barclays and its affiliates may actively trade and effect
transactions in the equity, debt and/or

Spirit retained Morgan Stanley to act as financial advisor to the Spirit board of directors in connection with the proposed merger, pursuant to an
engagement letter dated December 17, 2019. The Spirit board of directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan
Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its knowledge of, and involvement in, recent transactions in the industry, and its knowledge of Spirit’s
business and affairs. At the meeting of the Spirit board of directors on July 27, 2022, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
writing, that as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications
and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by
the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than certain excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view
to such holders of shares of Spirit common stock.
The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of July 27, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the various assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its
opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley’s opinion
was rendered for the benefit of the Spirit board of directors, in its capacity as such, and addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of
the date of such opinion, of the merger consideration to the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than certain excluded shares). Morgan
Stanley’s opinion did not address any other aspects or implications of the merger, including the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, the price at which shares of Spirit common stock would trade at any time, or the fairness of the
amount or nature of the compensation to any officers, directors or employees of Spirit, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common stock pursuant to the merger. Morgan Stanley did not express any opinion or
recommendation as to how the Spirit stockholders should vote at the stockholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the merger. The summary of
the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Spirit;
•

56Table of Contents
•

In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by Spirit, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With
respect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of Spirit management of the future financial performance of Spirit. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions,
including, among other things, that the definitive merger agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan
Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the
contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit, and did not
solicit, interest from any party with respect to any acquisition, business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving Spirit. Morgan Stanley
did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby
or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection therewith.
Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the
assessment of Spirit and its legal, tax and regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax and regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with
respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Spirit’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,
relative to the merger consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than certain excluded shares) in the transaction.
Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the treatment of the Spirit convertible notes or the Spirit warrants pursuant to the merger
agreement. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Spirit, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished
with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect
on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, July 27, 2022. Events occurring after July 27, 2022 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion
and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its
written opinion dated July 27, 2022. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed
and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or
weight given to those analyses. In connection with arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis described below. Considering any portion of such analyses and factors considered, without considering all
analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. Some of these summaries of
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables
must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Furthermore,
mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to below.
For purposes of Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the analyses described below, and with the consent of Spirit management, Morgan Stanley has assumed
that the merger consideration is $33.50 per share in cash.

Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or
before July 26, 2022, the last trading day prior to the date of the meeting of the Spirit board of directors at which Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,
and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. Capitalization information for Spirit, including fully-diluted number of shares and balance
sheet information, was provided on July 25, 2022 by Spirit management to Morgan Stanley, and was approved by Spirit management for Morgan Stanley’s
use in its financial analyses.
In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and relied upon the Spirit Financial Forecasts,
as more fully described in the section entitled “—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, which were approved by Spirit management for
Morgan Stanley’s use in connection with its financial analyses.
Public Trading Benchmark Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading benchmark analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar
companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for Spirit with comparable publicly available
consensus equity analyst research estimates for selected companies that, in Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment, share certain similar business
characteristics with and have certain comparable operating characteristics, including, among other things, product characteristics, similarly sized revenue
and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalization, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics, to those of Spirit (which companies
are referred to as the comparable companies) (which we refer to as the “Spirit Consensus Forecasted Financial Information of Spirit”). JetBlue was
included in the group of comparable companies.
For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of adjusted enterprise value (which we refer to as “Adj. EV”), which Morgan Stanley
defined as fully diluted market capitalization plus total debt, including capitalized operating lease liabilities, plus preferred stock, plus non-controlling
interest, less cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities and short term investments), to EBITDAR, which Morgan Stanley defined as
operating income plus depreciation, amortization and rent expense plus addbacks for certain one-time costs, in each case estimated for the calendar year
2023, which ratio Morgan Stanley referred to as 2023E Adj. EV / EBITDAR. Morgan Stanley also analyzed the ratio of price per share as of July 26, 2022 to
earnings per share estimated for the calendar year 2023, which ratio Morgan Stanley referred to as 2023E P / E. The Spirit (Unaffected) market data was as
of February 4, 2022 (the unaffected date for Spirit’s share price, reflecting the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Frontier merger
agreement). The Spirit (JETS Adjusted) market data was as of February 4, 2022 (the unaffected date for Spirit’s share price, reflecting the last trading day
prior to the announcement of the Frontier merger agreement), but the Spirit share price was adjusted for the percentage change in the US Global Jets ETF
between February 4, 2022 and July 26, 2022.
The below tables summarize the companies, the metrics and the multiples employed in this analysis:

No company utilized in the public trading benchmark analysis is identical to Spirit or directly comparable in business mix, size or other metrics.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing analysis necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences
between Spirit and the companies being compared and other factors that would affect the value of the companies to which Spirit is being compared. In
selecting comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous judgments and assumptions with respect to size, business mix, industry performance,
general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Spirit. These include,
among other things, the impact of competition on Spirit’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition and prospects of Spirit, the industry, or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of
Spirit or the companies to which it is being compared.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis on Spirit, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the
present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range
of per share equity values for Spirit.
Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated present value of the stand-alone unlevered free cash flows that Spirit was forecasted to generate for the nine
months ending December 31, 2022 and calendar years 2023 through 2026 on a standalone basis. Financial data used in this analysis were based on the
Spirit Financial Forecasts.
Morgan Stanley performed this analysis on the estimated future cash flows contained in the Spirit Financial Forecasts as set forth in the section entitled
“—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” For purposes of this analysis, unlevered free cash flows were calculated as Adjusted EBITDAR less
rent expense, less unlevered cash tax expense (taking into account net operating losses and other differences between accounting tax expense and cash
taxes paid), less change in net working capital, less change in deferred heavy maintenance, less capital expenditures (including pre-delivery deposits for
flight equipment, net of refunds, and proceeds from sale of property and equipment), plus certain other non-cash expenses. These estimated unlevered
free cash flows were reviewed and approved by Spirit management for Morgan Stanley’s use.
Morgan Stanley calculated terminal values for Spirit by applying a range of multiples of Adj. EV / EBITDAR of 5.5x to 7.0x, based on Morgan Stanley’s
professional judgment, to the Adjusted EBITDAR of Spirit for the
59
Table of Contents
calendar year 2026. Morgan Stanley then adjusted the terminal value for the capitalized operating leases at December 31, 2026 (based on the Spirit
Financial Forecasts) and discounted the unlevered free cash flows and terminal value to present value as of March 31, 2022 using mid-year convention
(except for terminal value which was discounted using end-of-period methodology) and a range of discount rates from 10.6% to 12.2%, which were
selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment to reflect an estimate of Spirit’s weighted average cost of capital (which we refer to as
“WACC”). The WACC was determined utilizing the capital asset pricing model to calculate Spirit’s cost of equity and estimated blended interest rate for
Spirit’s secured and unsecured debt as the basis for Spirit’s cost of debt. To calculate the implied per share equity value, Morgan Stanley then divided the
implied equity value by the number of fully diluted shares of Spirit common stock outstanding as of July 25, 2022, as provided by Spirit management on
July 25, 2022 using the treasury stock method.
Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of Spirit common stock on a fully-diluted basis
(rounded to the nearest $0.25):

Discounted Equity Value Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity value of a company
as a function of the company’s estimated future earnings. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied
present value for such company’s potential future equity value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present
equity values per share on a stand-alone basis for Spirit.
To calculate the discounted equity value for Spirit, Morgan Stanley utilized estimated calendar year 2025 EBITDAR and estimated calendar year 2025
earnings per share based on the Spirit Financial Forecasts. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience after reviewing and
comparing certain financial estimates for Spirit, Morgan Stanley applied a range of multiples of Adj. EV / EBITDAR for the 12-month period following
January 1, 2025 of 5.0x to 6.5x, and a range of multiples of P / E for the 12-month period following January 1, 2025 of 9.0x to 11.0x, respectively, to these
estimates, which ranges were selected based upon Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience taking into account Spirit’s historical long-
term trading multiples, and discounted the resulting values to March 31, 2022 at a discount rate of 12.9% based on Morgan Stanley’s estimate of Spirit’s
then-current cost of equity.
Based on this analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following ranges of implied equity value per share of Spirit common stock on a fully-diluted basis

Other Information
Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but
which were noted as reference data for the Spirit board of directors, including the following information described below under “—Historical Trading
Range” and “—Discounted Analyst Price Targets.”
Historical Trading Range
Morgan Stanley reviewed the historical range of closing stock prices of Spirit common stock for the 52-week period ended on February 4, 2022 and the
historical range of closing stock prices of Spirit common stock for the 52-week period ended on July 26, 2022. The ranges were as follows:

Morgan Stanley noted that the merger consideration was $33.50 per share, based upon its assumptions made with the consent of Spirit management.
The historical trading range analysis was presented for reference purposes only, and was not relied upon for valuation purposes.
Discounted Analyst Price Targets
Morgan Stanley reviewed future public market trading price targets for Spirit common stock, prepared and published by selected equity research analysts
prior to July 26, 2022, based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates. These forward targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of
the 12-month future public market trading price of Spirit common stock. Morgan Stanley discounted to March 31, 2022, these 12-month future market
trading price estimates by the estimated cost of equity for Spirit of 12.9%, which discount rates were selected based upon Morgan Stanley’s professional
judgment and experience.
The indicative discounted value range of the research analysts’ price targets was $21.25 to $32.00 per share for Spirit common stock.
Morgan Stanley noted that the merger consideration was $33.50 per share, based upon its assumptions made with the consent of Spirit management.
The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect the current market trading prices for shares of
Spirit common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of Spirit as well as future market
conditions.
The discounted analyst price targets analysis was presented for reference purposes only, and was not relied upon by Morgan Stanley for valuation
purposes.
General
In connection with the review of the merger by the Spirit board of directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not
61
Table of Contents
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without
considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley
may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to
be Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual value of Spirit. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous judgments and assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
the control of Spirit. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Spirit’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and
the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Spirit, the industry, or the financial markets in general. Any
estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Spirit common stock (other than certain excluded shares) and in connection with the delivery of
its written opinion, dated July 27, 2022, to the Spirit board of directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which
shares of Spirit common stock might actually trade.
The merger consideration was determined by Spirit and JetBlue through arm’s length negotiations between Spirit and JetBlue and was approved by the
Spirit board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided financial advice to the Spirit board of directors during these negotiations but did not, however,
recommend any specific merger consideration to Spirit or the Spirit board of directors or opine that any specific merger consideration constituted the only
appropriate merger consideration for the merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other
alternative business or financial strategies or transaction or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available, nor did it address the
underlying business decision of Spirit to enter into the merger agreement or proceed with the merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not in
any manner address the price at which Spirit common stock would trade at any time, or any compensation or compensation agreements arising from (or
relating to) the merger which benefit any officer, director, employee of Spirit, or any class of such persons, and was not intended to and did not express
any opinion or recommendation as to how the Spirit stockholders should vote at the stockholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the merger.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Spirit board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Spirit board of
directors in deciding to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. Consequently, the analyses as
described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Spirit board of directors with respect to the merger consideration or of
whether the Spirit board of directors would have been willing to agree to a different merger consideration. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a
committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.
Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its
securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime
brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at
any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and
effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of JetBlue, Spirit, or any other company,
or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.
Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Spirit board of directors with financial advisory services and a financial opinion,
described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex
62
Table of Contents
C, in connection with the merger, and Spirit has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $20.0 million, $1.75 million of which was paid in
connection with a separate engagement between Morgan Stanley and Spirit and is creditable against the fees for this transaction, $3 million of which was
paid upon the delivery of Morgan Stanley’s fairness opinion to the Spirit board of directors in connection with Spirit’s merger agreement with Frontier, $3
million of which became payable upon the delivery of Morgan Stanley’s fairness opinion to the Spirit board of directors in connection with Spirit’s merger
agreement with JetBlue, and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon, and will be paid upon, the consummation of the merger. Spirit also agreed
to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred from time to time in connection with its engagement. In addition, Spirit
agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any,
controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates, against certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses relating to, arising out of or in
connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement.
In the two years prior to July 5, 2022, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided (i) financial advisory and financing services to Spirit for which
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates received aggregate fees of between $10 million and $25 million and (ii) financing services to JetBlue for which Morgan
Stanley and its affiliates received aggregate fees of between $15 million and $25 million. As of the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley or an affiliate
thereof is a lender to Spirit and JetBlue. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Spirit and JetBlue and their
respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Financing",64,71
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Financing,"Financing
We anticipate that the funds needed to complete the merger will be funded in part with proceeds from the debt financing (as described below). Under the
merger agreement, JetBlue has agreed to deposit with a designated paying agent at or prior to the effective time of the merger the amount of cash
necessary to pay the amounts due to Spirit stockholders at the closing of the merger. Under the merger agreement, JetBlue has agreed to deposit with
Spirit (or, solely with respect to holders of equity awards who are not current or former employees, the paying agent) the amount of cash necessary to
pay the amounts due to Spirit’s holders of equity awards at the closing of the merger. Under the merger agreement, JetBlue has also agreed to make a
prepayment directly to Spirit stockholders of $2.50 per share following their approval of the merger agreement, and to make additional prepayments of
$0.10 per share per month commencing in January 2023 until the earlier of closing and termination of the merger agreement. JetBlue will enter into an
agreement with a disbursing agent that will contemplate, among other things, that JetBlue will deposit the funds necessary to make such payments with
the disbursing agent prior to the date such payments are due.
Debt Financing
In connection with the merger, JetBlue has entered into a second amended and restated debt commitment letter, dated July 28, 2022 (the “debt commitment
letter”), among JetBlue, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, BofA Securities, Inc., Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, Credit
Suisse Loan Funding LLC, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Natixis, New York Branch, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and MUFG
Bank, Ltd. (collectively referred to as the “debt commitment parties”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the debt
commitment parties have committed to provide to JetBlue, at the effective time of the merger, with a senior secured bridge facility in an aggregate principal
amount of up to $3.5 billion (collectively, the “debt financing”).
Under the terms of the debt commitment letter, the debt commitment parties’ obligation to fund the debt financing is subject to customary conditions,
including the consummation of the merger, in all material respects
63Table of Contents
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and other customary conditions, including, but not limited to:
•
the execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the debt commitment letter;
•
the delivery of customary closing documents;
•
the accuracy of certain representations and warranties in the merger agreement and specified representations and warranties in the
definitive debt documents;
•
the absence, since January 1, 2021, of a Spirit material adverse effect (which, for purposes of the debt commitment letter, is defined as in the
merger agreement), with certain exceptions;
•
the delivery of certain audited and unaudited financial statements of JetBlue and Spirit;
•
execution of customary documents required to create and perfect security interests, subject to the terms of and as required by the debt
commitment letter;
•
the payment of all applicable fees and expenses of the debt commitment parties;
•
receipt by the lenders of documentation and other information required under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations (including the PATRIOT Act); and
•
JetBlue having engaged one or more investment banks reasonably satisfactory to the lead arrangers to arrange, publicly sell or privately
place debt to replace the bridge facility.
Commitments in respect of the debt commitment letter will terminate on the earliest to occur of (1) public abandonment by JetBlue of the merger or the
termination by JetBlue, or with JetBlue’s consent, of the merger agreement prior to the consummation of the merger, (2) the consummation of the merger
without the debt financing, and (3) five business days after the outside date (as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement); provided
that such later outside date will not be later than July 24, 2024. JetBlue may, at its option, reduce the committed amount of debt financing under the debt
commitment letter, so long as (i) the aggregate amount of the debt financing (as so reduced) is sufficient, together with any other sources of funds
available to JetBlue and Merger Sub, to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) JetBlue concurrently deposits cash
and cash equivalents in an amount equal to such commitment reduction into a segregated account which will be solely available to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger",71,72
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,"Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendations of the Spirit board of directors with respect to the merger, Spirit stockholders should be aware that Spirit’s directors
and executive officers have interests in the merger, including financial interests, that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the other
Spirit stockholders. The Spirit board of directors was aware of and considered these interests during its deliberations of the merits of the merger and in
determining to recommend to Spirit stockholders that they vote for the merger proposal and thereby approve the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger (to the extent such interests existed at that time). See the sections entitled “—Background of the Merger” and
“—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Spirit Board of Directors” of this proxy statement, respectively. These interests are described and
quantified in detail in the narrative and tables below.
Spirit’s executive officers for purposes of the discussion below include:
•
Edward M. Christie, President and Chief Executive Officer;
•
Scott M. Haralson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;
•
John Bendoraitis, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer;

M. Laurie Villa, Spirit’s former Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, has been omitted from the discussion below because she has no
interest in the merger (except insofar as she is a holder of Spirit common stock) or any rights to compensation that will be accelerated or enhanced in
connection with the merger due to her departure from Spirit in June 2021.
Certain Assumptions
Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions, as well as those described in the footnotes to the tables in the section titled “—Merger-Related Compensation for Spirit’s Named
Executive Officers” below, were used:
•
the relevant price per share of Spirit common stock is $33.50, which is the price per share to be received by Spirit stockholders as merger
consideration in respect of their shares of Spirit common stock, assuming, solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section, that no
approval prepayment amount or additional prepayment amount will be paid to Spirit stockholders in respect of their shares of Spirit common
stock;
•
the effective time is September 12, 2022, which is the assumed date of the effective time of the merger solely for purposes of the disclosure
in this section (the “assumed effective time”);
•
the number of unvested Spirit equity-based and cash-based awards held by each executive officer of Spirit is as of September 12, 2022, the
latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement;
•
the completion of the merger will constitute a change in control, change of control or term of similar meaning for purposes of all Spirit plans
and agreements described below;
•
the employment of each executive officer of Spirit is terminated by Spirit without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for
“good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Spirit executive severance plan (as defined below)), in each case, at or immediately
following the assumed effective time;

(including 2022 Spirit PSU awards), in each case, that were granted under the Spirit equity award plan and the applicable award agreement thereunder. In
connection with the completion of the merger, all outstanding Spirit RSU awards, Spirit MSU awards and 2022 Spirit PSU awards will be assumed by
JetBlue (treating any performance-vesting condition as being achieved based on target performance) and converted into the right to receive (x) the
merger consideration, plus (y) the approval prepayment amount, solely to the extent (i) the related award has not been otherwise equitably or
discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity award plan and no amount has been otherwise paid to the holder to reflect the approval prepayment and
(ii) paid or payable after the closing of the merger, in each case, pursuant to the merger agreement, plus (z) any additional prepayment amount, solely to
the extent the related award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity award plan and no amount has been
otherwise paid to the holder to reflect any additional prepayment, with each such cash payment subject to the same service-based vesting schedule
applicable to the related Spirit RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Each Spirit PSU award (other than 2022 Spirit PSU
awards) will entitle each holder to receive the number of shares of Spirit common stock earned thereunder based on target performance as of immediately
prior to the effective time, pro-rated based on the portion of the applicable performance period elapsed as of the closing date of the merger, with the
resulting shares to be canceled and converted into the right to receive (x) the merger consideration, plus (y) the approval prepayment amount, solely to
the extent the related award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted and no amount has been otherwise paid to the holder to reflect
the approval prepayment, plus (z) any additional prepayment amount, solely to the extent the related award has not been otherwise equitably or
discretionarily adjusted and no amount has been otherwise paid to the holder to reflect any additional prepayment. For more details on the treatment of
outstanding Spirit equity-based awards in connection with the merger, see “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Spirit Equity-Based Awards and
Warrants,” beginning on page 86.
Equity-Based Awards held by Non-Employee Directors
Non-employee directors of Spirit held an aggregate of 48,529 Spirit RSU awards as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time. The amounts
reported in the table below reflect the number of outstanding Spirit RSU awards held by each non-employee director as of the assumed effective time, and
the value in respect of such Spirit RSU awards that will, effective as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time, be assumed by JetBlue and
converted into the right to receive JetBlue cash awards, which will be subject to the same service-based vesting schedule applicable to the related Spirit
RSU award as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time, as described above in “—Treatment of Outstanding Spirit Equity-Based Awards—In
General.” For each non-employee director, the value of the Spirit RSU awards is equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of such Spirit
RSU awards by $33.50 (the relevant price per share of Spirit common stock, as noted above under “—Certain Assumptions”). All unit numbers and dollar
values have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

director’s services.
Equity-Based Awards held by Executive Officers of Spirit
Spirit RSU awards, Spirit MSU awards and 2022 Spirit PSU awards held by Spirit’s executive officers are subject to “double-trigger” accelerated vesting
upon termination of an executive officer’s employment without “cause” or resignation by the executive officer for “good reason” (as such terms are
defined in the applicable award agreement) within twelve months following the completion of the merger. Spirit PSU awards (other than Spirit MSU
awards and 2022 Spirit PSU awards) held by Spirit’s executive officers are subject to “single trigger” accelerated vesting solely as a result of the closing
and proration based on the portion of the applicable performance period elapsed as of the closing date of the merger, as described above in “—Treatment
of Outstanding Spirit Equity-Based Awards—In General.” The amounts reported in the table below reflect the number of outstanding Spirit equity-based
awards held by each executive officer of Spirit as of the assumed effective time and the value in respect of:

Treatment of Outstanding Spirit Cash-Based Awards
Executive officers of Spirit, other than Ms. Grindle and Mr. Vanier, hold (i) time-based cash awards (each, a “Spirit time-based cash award”) and (ii) cash-
based awards subject to achievement of performance conditions (each, a “Spirit performance cash award”). The Spirit time-based cash awards and Spirit
performance cash awards will be assumed by JetBlue (treating any performance-vesting condition as being achieved based on target performance) and
continue to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule in the applicable award agreement. These awards are subject to “double-trigger” accelerated
vesting upon termination of an executive officer’s employment by Spirit without “cause” or resignation by the executive officer for “good reason” (as
such terms are defined in the Spirit executive severance plan) within twelve months following the completion of the merger, and will vest at (x) the date of
such termination of employment, if occurring on or after April 2, 2023 or (y) the end of the “non-compete period” (as defined in the following sentence), if
the termination occurs prior to April 2, 2023. The non-compete period will commence on the date of such termination of employment and end on the later
to occur of April 2, 2023 and the 90th day following such termination of employment. The amounts reported in the table below reflect the value in respect
of the Spirit time-based cash awards and Spirit performance cash awards that would be assumed by JetBlue at the assumed effective time:

Spirit 2017 Executive Severance Plan
Spirit maintains the 2017 Executive Severance Plan (the “Spirit executive severance plan”), which provides for payments and benefits upon a termination
of an executive officer’s services with Spirit without “cause” or resignation by the executive officer for “good reason” (as defined in the Spirit executive
severance plan) within eighteen months following a “change in control” (as defined in the Spirit executive severance plan) (a “change in control
termination”), in each case, conditioned upon the executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, and continued compliance with
any applicable restrictive covenant, as discussed in “—Restrictive Covenants” below.
In the event of a change in control termination, an executive officer will be entitled to receive:
(i)
a cash severance amount equal to (a) if such executive officer holds a title of “Vice President,” (1) 100% of the executive officer’s base salary
in effect on the termination date or the effective date of the Spirit executive severance plan (whichever is greater), plus (2) 100% of the
executive officer’s target incentive bonus for the year in which the “change in control” occurs, or (b) if such executive officer holds a title of
“Senior Vice President” or above, (1) 200% of the executive officer’s base salary in effect on the termination date or the effective date of the
Spirit executive severance plan (whichever is greater), plus (2) 200% of the executive officer’s target incentive bonus for the year in which
the “change in control” occurs;
(ii)
a pro-rated bonus for actual days of service in the year in which the “change in control” occurs, based on actual performance as of the date
of termination;
(iii)
continued coverage under COBRA for a period of six months (if the executive officer holds a title of “Vice President”) or twelve months (if
the executive officer holds a title of “Senior Vice President” or above), or, in each case, until the executive officer accepts a new position
with another company, whichever is shorter;
(iv)
a family travel pass for a period of six months (if the executive officer holds a title of “Vice President”) or twelve months (if the executive
officer holds a title of “Senior Vice President” or above) or, in each case, until the executive officer receives similar flight benefits with a new
employer, whichever is shorter;
(v)
continued use of the executive officer’s Spirit-issued cellphone for a period of thirty days following the executive officer’s last day of
service; and
(vi)
upon request by the executive officer within thirty days following the termination date, outplacement services through an outplacement
provider selected by Spirit, subject to a cap of $10,000.
Pursuant to the terms of the Spirit executive severance plan, payments or benefits provided for or otherwise payable to a Spirit executive officer pursuant
to the plan that would constitute a “parachute payment” as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to
as the “Code”), and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, will be reduced to an amount that can be paid without
triggering such excise tax, but only if such reduced amount would be greater than the net after tax proceeds (taking into account both the excise tax and
any interest or penalties payable by the executive officer with respect thereto) of the unreduced potential “parachute payments.”
For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to Spirit’s named executive officer in connection with a
qualifying termination following the merger, see “—Merger-Related Compensation for Spirit’s Named Executive Officers” below.
Existing Spirit Executive Agreements
Spirit has an existing employment letter agreement with Mr. Edward M. Christie and existing offer letters with the following executive officers: Messrs.
Scott M. Haralson, John Bendoraitis, Matthew H. Klein, Thomas C. Canfield, Rocky B. Wiggins, Brian J. McMenamy and Kevin Blake Vanier, and Ms.
Melinda C. Grindle.
69
Table of Contents
Other than for Mr. Christie, each such employment agreement and offer letter provides for severance solely in accordance with the Spirit executive
severance plan, which provides for severance benefits upon a change in control termination, as discussed in “—Spirit 2017 Executive Severance Plan”
above.
Restrictive Covenants
Mr. Christie is subject to a non-competition covenant and a non-solicitation of customers and employees covenant that are each applicable during the
period of employment and for twelve months following the termination of his services with Spirit pursuant to the terms of his letter agreement with Spirit.
Messrs. Haralson, McMenamy and Vanier and Ms. Grindle are each subject to a non-solicitation of employees covenant applicable during the period of
employment and for twelve months following the termination of their services with Spirit, and a perpetual non-disparagement covenant, pursuant to the
terms of their respective offer letters.
The other executive officers of Spirit are each subject to the restrictive covenants set forth in the Spirit executive severance plan, which include (i) a non-
solicitation of employees covenant that is applicable during the period of employment and the longer of (a) the period ending on the first anniversary of
the termination of the executive officer’s services or (b) the period over which the executive officer is entitled to receive cash severance payments under
the Spirit executive severance plan and (ii) a perpetual non-disparagement covenant. Further, the executive officers are also subject to a clawback and
forfeiture provision in their equity award agreements with Spirit in the event that they engage in any activity that is in competition with, or harmful to the
interests of, Spirit.
All executive officers are required to perpetually maintain the confidentiality of Spirit’s confidential information. Generally, the severance payments for
Spirit’s executive officers are conditioned upon (among other things) continued compliance with these covenants.
Spirit Retention Program
In connection with entering into the merger agreement, Spirit has established a retention program (the “Spirit retention program”) to incentivize and
encourage the continued employment of certain key employees through and following the consummation of the merger. Pursuant to the Spirit retention
program, Spirit will provide cash-based and, under certain circumstances, equity-based retention awards to certain key employees of Spirit, including
each of its executive officers (the “officer participants”), and certain non-officer employees (the “non-officer participants” and, together with the officer
participants, the “participants”).
Under the terms of the Spirit retention program, the retention awards for non-officer participants are generally payable in two installments, as follows: (i)
25% of a retention award will be paid to each non-officer participant on July 28, 2023 (or, if sooner, at the closing), subject to the non-officer participant’s
continued employment through such date, and (ii) the remaining 75% of a retention award will be paid within 30 days following the closing, subject to the
non-officer participant’s continued employment through the closing. Retention awards for officer participants will be payable on the same payment
schedule for non-officer participants, but in no event sooner than April 2, 2023, subject to the officer participant’s continued employment through the
applicable payment date.
In the event that a participant’s employment is terminated without “cause” or, solely with respect to a participant with a title of Director or above, for
“good reason” (in each case, as defined in the Spirit executive severance plan), then the participant’s retention award will vest and be paid in accordance
with the payment schedule described above, subject to compliance with the applicable conditions and obligations. If the closing occurs prior to April 2,
2023, and an officer participant’s termination of employment occurs after the closing and prior to April 2, 2023, then the officer participant’s retention
award will be paid after the lapse of the officer participant’s non-compete period (as defined above). If a participant (a) voluntarily resigns from Spirit
(other than, where applicable, for “good reason”), (b) is terminated by Spirit for “cause,” or (c) is terminated by Spirit due to the participant’s failure to (x)
perform satisfactorily pursuant to a documented individual performance improvement
70
Table of Contents
plan for the participant, or (y) provide reasonably necessary support to Spirit to effect a timely closing and to participate in pre-closing integration
planning, then all unpaid portions of such terminated participant’s retention award will be forfeited.
Spirit may provide an additional retention award to any non-officer participant and, if authorized by the Spirit compensation committee and approved by
JetBlue, any officer participant, provided that no non-officer participant may receive more than one additional retention award. The value of any
additional retention award will be determined based on retention awards granted to similarly situated employees and the proportion of the expected
retention period that has transpired and, with respect to non-officer participants, may not exceed 50% of the value of the non-officer participant’s initial
retention award. Any such additional retention awards will be paid in accordance with the payment schedule described above, but no earlier than twelve
months following the date of grant, subject to continued employment through such payment date. If a non-officer participant’s employment is terminated
without “cause” or, solely with respect to a non-officer participant with a title of Director or above, for “good reason” (in each case, as defined in the
Spirit executive severance plan), then any such additional retention award will be paid as soon as administratively practicable following such non-officer
participant’s termination of employment. All additional retention awards will be assumed by JetBlue as of the closing.
In the event that an officer participant’s initial retention award or, if authorized by the Spirit compensation committee and approved by JetBlue, additional
retention award, exceeds 100% of the sum of the officer participant’s (x) base salary and (y) target short-term incentive bonus, in each case, as of
February 1, 2022, then such excess amount will be payable in the form of restricted stock units of Spirit (the “Spirit retention RSU awards”), provided that
if an officer participant is terminated without “cause” or resigns for “good reason” (in each case, as defined in the Spirit executive severance plan), in
each case, prior to the closing, then such excess amount will instead be payable in cash in accordance with the payment schedule as described above,
subject to Spirit’s compliance with all applicable conditions. Any Spirit retention RSU awards will be issued (i) immediately prior to the closing, if issued
with respect to an initial retention award, or (ii) on the scheduled vesting date of the cash payable portion of the retention award, if issued with respect to
an additional retention award. The Spirit retention RSU awards will vest in three equal annual installments commencing from the scheduled payment date
of the cash payable portion of the officer participant’s retention award. The Spirit retention RSU awards will be assumed by JetBlue as of the closing and
converted into JetBlue RSU awards based on an adjustment ratio, subject to the same terms and conditions of the Spirit retention RSU awards, including
the vesting schedule, provided that JetBlue may settle such converted Spirit retention RSU awards in cash or stock at the sole discretion of the JetBlue
compensation committee. If an officer participant’s employment is terminated without “cause” or for “good reason” (in each case, as defined in the Spirit
executive severance plan) during the period commencing on the grant date of the Spirit retention RSU awards and ending twelve months after the closing,
then the Spirit retention RSU awards (or converted JetBlue RSUs) will vest in full and be settled as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.
If the merger agreement is terminated and the merger is not consummated, then (i) each non-officer participant who is still employed as of the date the
merger agreement is terminated will be entitled to 50% of the non-officer participant’s retention award (less any amounts previously paid), and (ii) each
officer participant who is still employed as of the date the merger agreement is terminated will be entitled to 50% of the officer participant’s retention
award (less any amounts previously paid), to be paid on the 30th day following the termination of the merger agreement (or on April 2, 2023, if later).
Subject to the terms and conditions described above, (i) each executive officer who holds a title of “Vice President” will receive a retention award in an
amount equal to the sum of each such executive officer’s base salary and target short-term incentive bonus, in each case, as of February 1, 2022, and (ii)
each executive officer who holds a title of “Senior Vice President” and above will receive a retention award in an amount equal to 150% of the sum of each
such executive’s base salary and target short-term incentive bonus, in each case, as of February 1, 2022.

Frontier Retention Program
On February 5, 2022, the Spirit compensation committee approved a key employee retention program (the “Frontier retention program”) in connection
with Spirit’s proposed transactions with Frontier pursuant to the Frontier merger agreement. Pursuant to the Frontier retention program, (i) each
participant with a title of Sr. Director and below who was still employed on July 27, 2022 (the date on which the Frontier merger agreement was terminated)
became entitled to a payment of 50% of the participant’s retention award (less any amounts previously paid), and (ii) each participant with a title of Vice
President and above, including Spirit’s executive officers, who is still employed as of April 2, 2023 will be entitled to 50% of such participant’s retention
award (less any amounts previously paid), to be paid within 30 days following such applicable date.
The table below sets forth the payment (each, a “partial retention award”) that each executive officer of Spirit is eligible to receive under the Frontier
retention program in connection with the termination of the Frontier merger agreement, assuming all other terms and conditions are satisfied:

Annual Cash Bonuses
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the closing of the merger occurs on or before December 31, 2023, (i) annual cash bonuses in respect of
the period between January 1, 2023 and the closing date will be paid to Spirit employees (including its executive officers) within three business days
following the closing of the merger in amounts calculated based on the level of performance attained as of immediately prior to the closing, as determined
by the Spirit board of directors in accordance with applicable performance and other customary criteria consistent with past practice, and prorated to
reflect the portion of the 2023 performance period elapsed as of the closing date and (ii) JetBlue will pay Spirit continuing employees (including its
executive officers) an annual bonus in respect of the 2023 fiscal year equal to the excess of (x) the annual bonus payable under the applicable Spirit bonus
plan for 2023 as in effect as of the closing date, calculated based on actual performance for the entire 2023 fiscal year over (y) the bonus paid to such
executive officer pursuant to clause (i).
Spirit and JetBlue have further agreed that, if the closing of the merger occurs in 2024 but prior to the date on which annual cash bonuses in respect of
2023 are determined and paid to Spirit employees (including its executive officers), such bonus payments in respect of 2023, if any, will be calculated on
the basis of actual performance for the 2023 performance period under the terms of the applicable Spirit bonus plan as will be determined by JetBlue’s
board of directors in good faith using a methodology reasonably consistent with the past practices of the Spirit board of directors. In addition, if the
closing does not occur prior to March 1, 2024, then Spirit will, following prior consultation with JetBlue, be permitted to adopt performance goals with
respect to an annual cash bonus program for Spirit’s 2024 fiscal year in the ordinary course of business, and in such case JetBlue will honor such bonus
program for Spirit continuing employees (including its executive officers) in accordance with its terms (subject to commercially reasonable adjustments
after the closing date as required for integration purposes). Except as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement or in an applicable
severance plan adopted by Spirit, in each case, prior to the date of the merger agreement or in accordance with the merger agreement, in order to be
eligible to receive any bonus payment, a continuing employee must be

employed by either Spirit or JetBlue or any subsidiary of JetBlue on the date the bonus is paid (or, with respect to any bonus period in 2023 ending on or
prior to the closing, the closing date) and, if not so employed on such date, any bonus payment otherwise due to such individual will be forfeited.
Future Long-Term Incentive Awards
Spirit and JetBlue have agreed that Spirit may grant equity- and cash-based long-term incentive awards to employees, including executive officers, in
respect of the remainder of fiscal year 2022, and in respect of fiscal years 2023 and 2024, in each case, in the ordinary course consistent with Spirit’s 2022
practices and subject to certain limitations. Any equity-based long-term incentive awards granted in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 that are outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time will be assumed by JetBlue and converted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the related equity-
based long-term incentive award as of immediately prior to the effective time, a JetBlue RSU award based on an adjustment ratio, subject to the same
terms and conditions (including the vesting schedule) that applied to the related equity-based long-term incentive award as of immediately prior to the
effective time; provided, however, that the JetBlue RSU award may be settled in cash or stock as determined by the JetBlue compensation committee in its
sole discretion. Any cash-based long-term incentive awards granted in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 will be assumed by JetBlue as of the effective time upon
the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreements.

Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Merger-Related Compensation for Spirit’s Named Executive Officers,"Merger-Related Compensation for Spirit’s Named Executive Officers
This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the estimated amounts of compensation for each of Spirit’s
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the
applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable to Spirit’s named executive
officers. The merger-related compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of Spirit stockholders, as described
above in “Spirit’s Proposals—Proposal No. 2 — Compensation Proposal.”
The table below sets forth estimates of the amounts of payments and benefits that each of Spirit’s named executive officers would receive in connection
with the merger using the assumptions described above under “—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Certain
Assumptions.” These estimates are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the
assumptions described in the footnotes to the table. The amounts below do not reflect compensation actions that may occur after the date of this proxy
statement but before the effective time. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a Spirit named executive officer may materially differ from
the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts set forth below have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

without “cause” or due to the named executive officer’s resignation for “good reason,” in each case, at or immediately following the assumed
effective time, will not result in the forfeiture by the named executive officer of such partial retention award pursuant to the terms of the Frontier
retention program, which requires each named executive officer of Spirit to remain continuously employed through April 2, 2023 to be eligible to
receive such partial retention award, as described above under ““—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Frontier
Retention Program,” and (D) each named executive officer’s unvested Spirit performance cash award and, for Mr. Haralson only, Spirit time-based

months after the assumed effective time, as described above under “—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
—Treatment of Outstanding Spirit Cash-Based Awards.” The payments of cash severance are each equal to (i) 200% of the named executive
officer’s base salary (as in effect at the assumed effective time, assuming that the termination of employment occurs on such date) and (ii) 200% of

year 2022 (i.e., the period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022) based on the named executive officer’s actual days of service in

(a) The cash severance payments are “double-trigger” payments, as they are each conditioned upon both the consummation of the merger
and termination of a named executive officer’s employment by Spirit without “cause” or resignation by the named executive officer for “good
reason” (in each case, as defined in the Spirit executive severance plan) within eighteen months following the effective time of the merger. In
addition, the receipt of such payments is conditioned upon the named executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, and
continued compliance with any applicable restrictive covenants.
(b) The amounts reported in this column represent the actual bonus earned by the named executive officer in respect of the first half of fiscal
year 2022 (i.e., the period commencing January 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2022), and a pro-rated bonus in respect of the second half of fiscal year
2022 (i.e., the period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022) based on the named executive officer’s actual days of service from
July 1, 2022, through the assumed effective time.

(c) The amounts reported in this column reflect the portion of the named executive officer’s retention award under the Spirit retention
program that is payable in cash, which is equal to the sum of 100% of the named executive officer’s base salary and target short-term incentive
bonus, in each case, as of February 1, 2022, as described above under “—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
—Spirit Retention Program.” The remaining portion of the named executive officer’s retention award, which is equal to the sum of 50% of the
named executive officer’s base salary and target short-term incentive bonus, in each case, as of February 1, 2022, is payable in the form of Spirit
retention RSU awards, as further discussed in footnote (2) below. The cash portion of the retention awards are “single-trigger” payments, as they
are conditioned solely upon the consummation of the merger.
(d) The amounts reported in this column reflect the partial retention award that each named executive officer is eligible to receive under the
Frontier retention program in connection with the termination of the Frontier merger agreement, which is equal to 50% of the named executive
officer’s retention award under the Frontier retention program, assuming, solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section, that the termination
of the named executive officer by Spirit without “cause” or due to the named executive officer’s resignation for “good reason,” in each case, at or
immediately following the assumed effective time, will not result in the forfeiture by the named executive officer of such partial retention award
pursuant to the terms of the Frontier retention program, which requires each named executive officer of Spirit to remain continuously employed
through April 2, 2023 to be eligible to receive such partial retention award, as described above under “—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger—Frontier Retention Program.”
(e) The Spirit time-based cash awards and Spirit performance cash awards are considered “double trigger” benefits, as they are each
conditioned upon both the consummation of the merger and termination of a named executive officer’s employment by Spirit without “cause” or
resignation by the named executive officer for “good reason” (in each case, as defined in the applicable award agreement) within twelve months
following the effective time of the merger. The following table quantifies the Spirit performance cash awards and, for Mr. Haralson only, the Spirit

Equity. The amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate value of the unvested (i) Spirit RSU awards, Spirit MSU awards and 2022
Spirit PSU awards held by each named executive officer of Spirit that will, effective as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time, be
assumed by JetBlue (treating, where applicable, any performance-vesting condition as being achieved based on target performance) and converted
into the right to receive JetBlue cash awards, which will be subject to the same service-based vesting schedule applicable to the related Spirit RSU
award as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time, including accelerated vesting upon a qualifying termination of employment within
twelve months following the consummation of the merger, as described above in “—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Equity-Based Awards held by Executive Officers of Spirit,” (ii) Spirit PSU awards (other than 2022 Spirit PSU awards) held by each named
executive officer that will, effective as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time, be settled in shares of Spirit common stock (treating any
performance-vesting condition as being achieved based on target performance), prorated based on the portion of the applicable performance period
elapsed as of the assumed effective time and converted into the right to receive certain cash payments, as described above in “—Interests of
Spirit’s Directors and
75
Table of Contents
Executive Officers in the Merger—Equity-Based Awards held by Executive Officers of Spirit,” and (iii) the portion of the named executive officer’s
retention award that is payable in the form of Spirit retention RSU awards that will be assumed by JetBlue as of the assumed effective time and
converted into JetBlue RSU awards based on an adjustment ratio, and continue to vest on the same terms and conditions as applied to the Spirit
retention RSU awards as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time, including accelerated vesting upon a qualifying termination of
employment within twelve months following the consummation of the merger, as described above under “—Interests of Spirit’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger—Spirit Retention Program.” The accelerated vesting of the Spirit RSU awards, Spirit MSU awards and 2022 Spirit
PSU Awards are considered “double trigger” benefits, as it is conditioned upon both the consummation of the merger and the named executive
officer’s termination without “cause” or resignation for “good reason” (in each case, as defined in the applicable award agreement) within twelve
months following the consummation of the merger. The accelerated vesting of the Spirit PSU awards (other than the 2022 Spirit PSU awards) are
considered “single trigger” benefits, as it is conditioned upon solely the consummation of the merger. Depending on the actual effective time of the
merger, it is possible that the equity values set forth in the table above will be higher or lower depending on actual performance. The following table
quantifies the Spirit RSU awards, Spirit MSU awards, Spirit PSU Awards (other than 2022 Spirit PSU awards), 2022 Spirit PSU awards and Spirit

(a) The amounts reported in this column were calculated by multiplying the number of shares underlying each Spirit RSU award, Spirit PSU
award and 2022 Spirit PSU award, as applicable, by $33.50 (the relevant price per share of Spirit common stock, as noted above under “—Interests of
Spirit’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Certain Assumptions”), with (x) any performance-vesting condition in respect of the Spirit
PSU awards and 2022 Spirit PSU awards treated as having been achieved based on target performance as of the assumed effective time and (y) the
resulting amount in respect of the Spirit PSU awards (other than the 2022 Spirit PSU awards) prorated based on the portion of the applicable
performance period elapsed as of the assumed effective time.
(b) The amounts reported in this column were calculated by multiplying the target number of units underlying the Spirit MSU award as set
forth in the named executive officer’s award agreement by 163.13% (which is the applicable performance multiplier designated in each award
agreement based on the relevant price of $33.50 per share of Spirit common stock).
(c) The amounts reported in this column represent the equity-based portion of each named executive officer’s retention award under the
Spirit retention program that is payable in the form of Spirit retention RSU awards, which is equal to the sum of 50% of the named executive
officer’s base salary and target short-term incentive bonus, in each case, as of February 1, 2022, as described above under “—Interests of Spirit’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Spirit Retention Program.”

assumed effective time: (i) continued health coverage under COBRA for a period of twelve months for each named executive officer, at the same rate
as in effect immediately prior to the assumed effective time (assuming that the termination of employment occurs on such date), (ii) outplacement
services for each named executive officer, (iii) use of a Spirit-owned mobile phone by each named executive officer for a period of thirty days
following the assumed effective time (assuming that the termination of employment occurs on such date), and (iv) for each of Messrs. Haralson,
Bendoraitis, Klein and Canfield, a family travel pass for a period of twelve months following the assumed effective time (assuming that the
termination of employment occurs on such date) and, for Mr. Christie, a lifetime travel pass (as provided for under his employment letter agreement
with Spirit). These perquisites and benefits are considered “double-trigger” payments, as they are each conditioned upon both the consummation
of the merger and termination of the named executive officer’s employment by Spirit without “cause” or resignation by the named executive officer
for “good reason” (in each case, as defined in the Spirit executive severance plan) within eighteen months following the effective time of the merger.
In addition, the receipt of such payments is conditioned upon the named executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims,
and continued compliance with any applicable restrictive covenants. The following table quantifies each separate perquisite and benefit included in

(a) Amounts reported in this column are based on the incremental cost to Spirit of providing such continued coverage to each named
executive officer. These benefits are also contingent upon each named executive officer timely and properly electing continuation coverage under
COBRA.
(b) Amounts reported in this column reflect the maximum of $10,000 that may be incurred by Spirit for such outplacement services in respect
of each such named executive officer.
(c) Amounts reported in this column are based on the incremental cost to Spirit of providing each named executive officer with continued use
of a mobile phone for a period of thirty days following the assumed effective time.
(d) Amounts reported in this column are based on the incremental cost to Spirit of providing travel passes to each named executive officer,
including reasonable estimates of the cost of incremental fuel, insurance, security, station cleaning, facility rent and station baggage rent, but
excluding fees and taxes paid by each named executive officer for the transportation. For Messrs. Haralson, Bendoraitis, Klein and Canfield, we
have assumed that such named executive officers and their eligible family members would each take ten round-trip flights during the applicable
twelve-month post-employment period. For Mr. Christie, the present value of his lifetime travel pass was calculated using a discount rate of 7.00%
and mortality assumptions based on the United States Statistics Life Expectancy Tables, and we have assumed that Mr. Christie and his eligible
family members would each take ten round-trip flights each year.

Appraisal Rights in the Merger",85,85
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Appraisal Rights in the Merger,"Appraisal Rights in the Merger
Under the DGCL, Spirit stockholders have the right to dissent from the merger and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of Spirit
common stock as determined by the Court of Chancery, together with
77Table of Contents
interest, if any, as determined by the Court, in lieu of the consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement. These
rights are known as appraisal rights. Spirit stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.
The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed by a stockholder in
order to perfect appraisal rights in connection with the merger. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and is incorporated
by reference herein in its entirety. Failure to precisely follow any of the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of
your appraisal rights. All references in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Spirit common stock unless otherwise
indicated.
Section 262 of the DGCL requires that, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, stockholders for whom
appraisal rights are available be notified not less than twenty days before the stockholders meeting to vote on the merger in connection with which
appraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to
Spirit stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in connection with the merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL
and a copy of the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached hereto as Annex D. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should
carefully review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL contained in Annex D to this proxy statement, since failure to timely and properly comply with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.
Any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights should consider consulting legal counsel before attempting to exercise such rights.
If you wish to exercise appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Spirit common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:
•
You must deliver to us a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote with respect to the merger is taken. This written
demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption and
approval of the merger agreement and the merger. Voting against or failing to vote for the merger proposal by itself does not constitute a
demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the
stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder’s failure to make a written
demand before the vote with respect to the merger is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
•
You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the merger proposal. A vote in favor of the merger proposal, by proxy submitted by
mail, over the Internet, by telephone or virtually during the special meeting, will cause you to lose your appraisal rights in respect of the
shares so voted and will nullify any written demands for appraisal you previously submitted. A proxy which does not contain voting
instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal. Therefore, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights must vote against the merger proposal or abstain from voting on the merger proposal.
•
You must continue to hold your shares of Spirit common stock from the date of making the demand through the effective date of the merger.
Therefore, a stockholder who is the record holder of shares of Spirit common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made but
who thereafter transfers the shares before the effective date of the merger will lose any right to appraisal with respect to such shares.
•
You must otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
78
Table of Contents
If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration (without interest
and subject to any required tax withholding), but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Spirit common stock.
Only a holder of record of shares of Spirit common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand for
appraisal in respect of shares of Spirit common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, fully and correctly, as his, her or its name
appears on his, her or its stock certificates, and must state that such person intends thereby to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Spirit common
stock in connection with the merger. If shares of Spirit common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if the shares of Spirit common stock are owned of record by more
than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an
authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal on behalf of a stockholder of record; however, the agent must
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner or
owners. If the shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or nominee, the broker, bank or nominee may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the
shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners; in such case,
however, the written demand should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is expressly mentioned,
we will presume that the demand covers all shares held in the name of the record owner. If you hold your shares of Spirit common stock in a brokerage
account or in other nominee form and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker or the other nominee to determine the
appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.
Beneficial owners of shares of Spirit common stock held in “street name” who desires appraisal should take such actions as may be necessary to ensure
that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of such shares. Shares held through brokerage firms, banks and other financial
institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a nominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co. Any beneficial
holder desiring appraisal who holds shares through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution is responsible for ensuring that the demand for
appraisal is made by the record holder. The beneficial holder of such shares should instruct such firm, bank or institution that the demand for appraisal be
made by the record holder of the shares, which may be the nominee of a central security depository if the shares have been so deposited. As required by
Section 262, a demand for appraisal must reasonably inform Spirit of the identity of the holder(s) of record (which may be a nominee as described above)
and of such holder’s intention to seek appraisal of such shares.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be addressed to Spirit at Spirit Airlines, Inc., 2800 Executive Way, Miramar,
Florida 33025, and must be delivered before the vote on the merger agreement is taken at the special meeting.
Within ten days after the effective date of the merger, Spirit, as the surviving corporation, must give written notice that the merger has become effective to
each stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL, has properly delivered a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of
the merger agreement and the merger. At any time within sixty days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has demanded an
appraisal, and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration (without interest and subject to any required tax withholding) specified by the merger
agreement for his, her or its shares of Spirit common stock by delivering to Spirit, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for
appraisal. After this period, the stockholder may withdraw such demand for appraisal only with the written consent of Spirit, as the surviving corporation.
Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will, upon
written request to Spirit, as the surviving corporation, be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth
79
Table of Contents
the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger agreement and the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal rights have
been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Spirit common stock held in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, request from the corporation the statement described in the
previous sentence. Such written statement will be mailed to the requesting stockholder within ten days after such written request is received by the
surviving corporation or within ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, either Spirit, as the surviving corporation, or any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the
fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Spirit common stock held in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the
filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition will be made upon Spirit, as the surviving corporation. If no such petition is filed
within that 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all holders of shares who had previously demanded appraisal of their shares. Spirit, as the
surviving corporation, has no obligation to file such a petition in the event there are dissenting stockholders. There is no present intent on the part of
Spirit to file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that Spirit will file such a petition or that Spirit
will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should
initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the
DGCL.
If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to Spirit, as the surviving corporation, Spirit will then be
obligated, within twenty days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was
filed, a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements
as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court of Chancery,
must give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving corporation and to the
stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice must also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the
day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court of Chancery
deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication must be approved by the Court of Chancery, and the costs thereof will be borne by
the surviving corporation. At the hearing on such petition, the Court of Chancery will determine the stockholders who have complied with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who
have demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; if any stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss
the proceedings as to that stockholder. In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible
for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.
After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of Spirit common stock, the Court of Chancery will appraise the shares,
determining their fair value exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any.
Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in Section 262 of the DGCL,
interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and
the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, Spirit, as the surviving corporation,
80
Table of Contents
may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if
any, between the amount paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at
that time. Upon application by Spirit, as the surviving corporation, or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court of
Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal before the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by Spirit, as the surviving corporation, and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock
to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. When the fair value is determined, the Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with
interest thereon, if any, by Spirit, as the surviving corporation, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and in the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to Spirit of the certificates representing such stock.
In determining the fair value of the shares of Spirit common stock and, if applicable, interest, the Court of Chancery is required to take into account all
relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an
appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community
and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value
of a company.”
The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court may consider market value, asset value, the negotiated
transaction price, the unaffected stock price, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as
of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has recently indicated that
absent deficiencies in the sale process the negotiated transaction price should be given “considerable weight” by the Court of Chancery in determining
fair value. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass
known elements of value,” but rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,
the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as
of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Spirit common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same
as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not
otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Moreover, we do not anticipate offering more than the per share merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve the right
to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of Spirit common stock is less than the
per share merger consideration.
Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon Spirit, as the surviving corporation, and the stockholders participating in the appraisal
proceeding by the Court of Chancery as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery
may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares
entitled to appraisal. In the absence of an order, each party bears its own expenses. Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal
rights in compliance with
81
Table of Contents
Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive
payments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares, other than with respect to payment as of a record date before the effective
time of the merger. If no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers a written
withdrawal of his or her demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger within sixty days after the effective date of the merger or
thereafter with the written approval of Spirit, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed, the appraisal
proceeding in the Court of Chancery will not be dismissed as to any stockholder without the prior approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing will not affect the rights of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to
accept the merger consideration that such holder would have received (without interest and subject to any required tax withholding) pursuant to the
merger agreement within sixty days after the effective date of the merger.
In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue appraisal rights should consult
their legal advisors.",85,90
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,"Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
U.S. Antitrust Laws
Under the HSR Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions may not be consummated unless Notification and Report Forms (which
we refer to as “HSR Notifications”) have been filed with the Antitrust Division of the DOJ (which we refer to as the “Antitrust Division”) and the FTC,
and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. JetBlue and Spirit filed a Premerger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the
Antitrust Division and the FTC in connection with the merger contemplated by the merger agreement on August 12, 2022. The initial waiting period is
thirty days, but (i) this period may be shortened if the reviewing agency grants “early termination,” (ii) it may be restarted if the acquiring person
voluntarily withdraws and re-files its Notification and Report Form, and/or (iii) it may be extended if the reviewing agency issues a request for additional
information and documentary material (which we refer to as a “Second Request”), in which case, the waiting period expires thirty days after the date when
both parties have substantially complied with such request though it is customary to reach a timing agreement with the Antitrust Division to not
consummate the proposed merger for a further period of time after substantial compliance. The merger is subject to such requirements, and JetBlue and
Spirit expect that the Antitrust Division will issue a Second Request. The Antitrust Division will assess the legality under the antitrust laws of the
proposed merger. At any time before or after the consummation of the proposed merger, the Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust
laws of the United States as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the merger or seeking divestiture of the
assets of JetBlue and/or Spirit or their respective subsidiaries. Private parties and individual state attorneys general may also bring legal actions under the
antitrust laws. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if such a challenge is made, what the
result would be.
Competition Laws of Other Jurisdictions
The antitrust, competition or merger control laws of certain other countries in which Spirit and/or JetBlue operate may require the submission of a merger
control notification with, and the obtaining of the pre-merger approval of, antitrust or competition authorities therein. There can be no assurance that a
challenge to the merger on foreign antitrust or competition grounds will not be made, or if such a challenge is made, what the result will be.
Other Regulatory Approvals
In addition to the antitrust related filings, clearances and approvals discussed above, JetBlue and Spirit must file notices with, and obtain any approvals
and authorizations required to be obtained from, the DOT, the FAA and

the FCC, as well as all other approvals and authorizations required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement from any other governmental authority.

on March 30, 2022. The complaints name as defendants Spirit and members of the Spirit board of directors. The Stein complaint also names as defendants
Frontier and Top Gun Acquisition Corp.
Except for the Playford complaint, which was brought pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL demanding the right to inspect, among other things, certain
books and records relating to the prior transaction with Frontier, each of the complaints alleges violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The complaints generally allege that the defendants filed a materially incomplete and misleading registration
statement or proxy statement with the SEC. Each of the complaints seeks injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the prior transaction with
Frontier, damages and other relief.
The Lo complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on June 10, 2022, the Crenshaw complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on
June 16, 2022, the Votto complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 18, 2022, the Stein complaint was voluntarily dismissed with

As of September 9, 2022, seven stockholder demand letters have been sent to Spirit by alleged Spirit stockholders in connection with the prior transaction
with Frontier. A stockholder demand letter was sent on behalf of Wade Alford on March 29, 2022. A stockholder demand letter was sent on behalf of
Catherine Coffman on April 6, 2022. A stockholder demand letter was sent on behalf of Jordan Wilson on April 25, 2022. A stockholder demand letter was
sent on behalf of Steven Evans on May 2, 2022. A stockholder demand letter was

sent on behalf of Edward Smith on May 3, 2022. A stockholder demand letter was sent on behalf of Teamsters Local 237 Additional Security Benefit Fund
and Teamsters Local 237 Supplemental Fund for Housing Authority Employees on May 23, 2022 (the “Teamsters demand letter”). A stockholder demand
letter was sent on behalf of Ian Rachelefsky on July 11, 2022 (the “Rachelefsky demand letter”). Except for the Rachelefsky and Teamsters demand letters,
which were sent pursuant to Section 220 of the DGCL demanding the right to inspect, among other things, certain books and records relating to the prior
transaction with Frontier, each of the letters alleged disclosure deficiencies in the proxy statement soliciting stockholder approval of the Frontier merger
agreement and demanded that additional disclosures be made before Spirit stockholders vote on the prior transaction with Frontier.
Spirit believes that the claims asserted in the complaints and demand letters are without merit and have been mooted by (i) subsequent disclosures made
by Spirit and (ii) the agreement between Spirit and Frontier on July 27, 2022 to mutually terminate the Frontier merger agreement. Spirit may receive
additional stockholder demand letters, and additional lawsuits related to the merger or the prior transaction with Frontier may be filed in the future.

The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement.
Factual disclosures about JetBlue or Spirit contained in this proxy statement or in JetBlue’s or Spirit’s public reports filed with the SEC may supplement,
update or modify the factual disclosures about JetBlue and Spirit contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary. The representations,
warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to
by Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations
and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties

between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a

Spirit MSU awards), will be assumed by JetBlue and converted into, for each share of Spirit common stock underlying the related Spirit RSU award as of
immediately prior to the effective time (treating for this purpose any performance-based vesting conditions to which a 2022 Spirit PSU award or Spirit
MSU award is subject as having been achieved based on target performance as of immediately prior to the effective time), the right to receive an amount
in cash that is subject to the same service vesting schedule applicable to the related Spirit RSU award and is equal to the sum of:
(x) the merger consideration, plus
(y) solely to the extent (1) the related Spirit RSU award has not been otherwise equitably or discretionarily adjusted under the Spirit equity award

Spirit PSU Awards (Other than 2022 Spirit PSU Awards). Each Spirit PSU award granted pursuant to the Spirit equity award plan (other than a 2022

performance as of immediately prior to the effective time, in each case, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of whole
months elapsed from the first day of the applicable performance period until the closing and the denominator of which is equal to the total months in the
applicable performance period. Any shares of Spirit common stock so delivered in respect of a Spirit PSU award will be deemed to be issued and

converted into a warrant exercisable for the merger consideration, and JetBlue will assume the punctual performance and observance of each and every
covenant, agreement, and condition of the warrants such that each such warrant will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
as applied to the warrants prior to the effective time. The approval prepayment amount and the additional prepayment amount will be payable upon

Prior to the effective time of the merger, JetBlue will enter into an agreement with a paying agent designated by JetBlue and reasonably acceptable to
Spirit to act as paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment and issuance of the merger consideration. At or immediately following the effective
time of the merger, JetBlue will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the paying agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate merger
consideration to which holders of shares of Spirit common stock will be entitled at the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as the “payment
fund”).
As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, and in any event within three business days thereafter, JetBlue will cause the paying
agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Spirit common stock (i) in the case of such shares represented by certificates, (A) a letter of transmittal,
which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates (if any) will pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the
paying agent, and will otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as JetBlue or the paying agent may reasonably specify and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates, and (ii) in the case of book-entry shares, each share will automatically upon the effective
time of the merger be entitled to receive, and the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable
after the effective time of the merger (and in any event, within three business days thereafter), the merger consideration payable for each such share.
In case of certificates, upon delivery and surrender of certificates for cancellation to the paying agent and a duly executed letter of transmittal in proper
form, the holders thereof will be entitled to receive from the payment fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration with
respect to each share evidenced by such certificates.

to one another as of specific dates. These representations and warranties have been made for the benefit of the other parties to the merger agreement and
may be intended not as statements of fact but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be incorrect. In
addition, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter provided by Spirit
to JetBlue and Merger Sub in connection with the signing of the merger agreement and a confidential disclosure letter provided by JetBlue and Merger
Sub to Spirit in connection with the signing of the merger agreement. While Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub do not believe that the disclosure letters
contain information required to be publicly disclosed under the applicable securities laws other than information that has already been so disclosed, the
disclosure letters do contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the attached
merger agreement. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties as current characterizations of factual information about Spirit,
JetBlue or Merger Sub since they were made as of specific dates, may be intended merely as a risk allocation mechanism between us, JetBlue and Merger
Sub and are modified in important ways by the confidential disclosure letters.

Upon entry into the merger agreement, Spirit agreed that it will, and will cause its officers, directors and employees to, and instruct its other
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any persons or entities that may be
ongoing with respect to any acquisition proposal, or any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, discussions, negotiations or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal. Spirit also agreed that it will promptly inform each such person or entity of the obligations in
the merger agreement and promptly instruct each person or entity that has previously executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such
person or entity’s consideration of an acquisition proposal to return to Spirit, or destroy any non-public information previously furnished to such person
or entity to any person or entity’s representatives by or on behalf of Spirit, and promptly terminate all physical and electronic data room access
previously granted to any such person or entity and its representatives.
Spirit also agreed that it will not, and will cause its officers, directors and employees to not, and instruct its other representatives to not, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations relating to any acquisition proposal with any
person or entity other than JetBlue or Merger Sub; (iii) furnish to any person or entity other than JetBlue or Merger Sub, any non-public information in
connection with an acquisition proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; (iv) enter into any agreement, letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option or other similar contract providing for or
otherwise relating to any acquisition proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement)
or that is intended to result in, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal (each of which we refer to as an “alternative
acquisition agreement”); or (v) submit any acquisition proposal or any matter related thereto to the vote of the Spirit stockholders.
Spirit will not terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it is a party; however, Spirit
may grant a waiver of any such provision to the extent required to permit a party to submit an acquisition proposal if the Spirit board of directors
determines that the failure to grant such waiver would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Spirit directors and Spirit
promptly notifies JetBlue.
Spirit must promptly (and in any event, within twenty-four hours): (i) notify JetBlue of (A) any inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) relating to an
acquisition proposal (including any material modification thereto) that is received by Spirit or any of its respective representatives or (B) any inquiries,
requests, proposals or offers received by, or any discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with Spirit or any of its respective
representatives concerning an acquisition proposal; and (ii) disclose to JetBlue the identity of such person making, and provide an unredacted copy of,
any such written acquisition proposal or any such inquiry, expression of interest, request, proposal or offer made in writing (or, if made orally, a
reasonably detailed description of such acquisition proposal, inquiry, request, proposal or offer). Spirit will, promptly upon receipt or
96Table of Contents
delivery thereof (and in any event, within twenty-four hours), provide JetBlue and its outside counsel with copies of all drafts and final versions of
definitive or other agreements including schedules and exhibits relating to such acquisition proposal, in each case exchanged between Spirit or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the person making such acquisition proposal or any of its representatives, on the other hand. Spirit will keep
JetBlue reasonably informed of the status and terms (including with respect to any change in price or other material amendments) of any such acquisition
proposal or other inquiry, request, offer or proposal concerning an acquisition proposal. Spirit will promptly, and in any event, within twenty-four hours
following a determination by the Spirit board of directors that an acquisition proposal is a superior proposal, notify JetBlue of such determination.
However, if at any time on or after the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of (1) receipt of Spirit stockholder approval to adopt the merger and (2)
the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms: (i) Spirit has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal from a third party; (ii)
such acquisition proposal did not result from a breach of the provisions of the merger agreement related to acquisition proposals; (iii) the Spirit board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel that such acquisition proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be likely to lead to a superior proposal; (iv) after consultation with its outside counsel, the Spirit board of directors determines in good faith
that the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Spirit stockholders under applicable
law; and (v) Spirit receives from such person an executed acceptable confidentiality agreement; then Spirit may take the following actions: (A) furnish
information with respect to Spirit to the person or entity making such acquisition proposal pursuant to one or more acceptable confidentiality
agreements; and/or (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or entity making such acquisition proposal regarding such acquisition
proposal. In such event, Spirit must provide written notice to JetBlue of the determination referenced in clause (iii) and (iv) in the foregoing sentence
promptly (and in any event, within twenty-four hours), and Spirit must provide to JetBlue in writing any information concerning Spirit provided to such
other person or entity that was not previously provided to JetBlue or its representatives prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided
to such other person or entity. Spirit will also deliver to JetBlue a copy of any executed acceptable confidentiality agreement promptly following its
execution.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement related to acquisition proposals, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the
effective time of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, none of Spirit, the Spirit board of directors nor any
committee thereof will, or will publicly propose to: (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, or modify in a manner adverse to JetBlue (or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or so modify), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Spirit board of directors or any such
committee of the merger proposal; (ii) fail to include the Spirit board of directors’ recommendation in favor of the approval of the merger proposal in this
proxy statement; (iii) approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose to approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable)
any acquisition proposal; (iv) submit any acquisition proposal or any matter related thereto to the vote of the Spirit stockholders; or (v) authorize,
commit, resolve or agree to take any such actions (each such action we refer to as a “change of company board recommendation”).
However, if: (i) Spirit has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal from a third party that did not result from a breach of the merger agreement and
that the Spirit board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a superior
proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement that have been delivered to Spirit by JetBlue in
writing during the notice period provided pursuant thereto; and (ii) the Spirit board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that a failure to make a change of company board recommendation and/or cause Spirit to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement
with respect to such superior proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the directors of Spirit to the
Spirit stockholders under applicable law, then, prior to (but not after) the time the required stockholder vote for the merger proposal is obtained, the Spirit
board of directors may take the following actions: (y) effect a change of company board recommendation with respect to such superior proposal; or (z)
terminate
97
Table of Contents
the merger agreement pursuant to its terms and enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal. In connection with
such termination of the merger agreement, Spirit would be required to pay JetBlue a termination fee of $94.2 million. In addition, prior to effecting such
change of company board recommendation or terminating the merger agreement, Spirit is required to: (A) provide prior written notice to JetBlue, at least
four business days in advance, of Spirit’s intention to take such action with respect to such superior proposal, which notice will specify the material terms
and conditions of such superior proposal (including all of the information that is specified in the merger agreement with respect to such superior
proposal), together with a copy of all relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such superior proposal; and (B) during such notice
period, negotiate with JetBlue in good faith (to the extent JetBlue desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement so that such acquisition proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal, provided that in the event of any material revisions to the
superior proposal, Spirit will be required to deliver a new written notice to JetBlue and to comply with the requirements of the merger agreement with
respect to such new written notice; however, the notice period for any subsequent notice will be shortened from four business days to two business
days. The notice period (and any extension thereof) must have expired before Spirit effects any such change of company board recommendation or
terminates the merger agreement.
In the event that prior to (but not after) the time the required stockholder vote for the merger proposal is obtained, the Spirit board of directors may make
a change of company board recommendation in response to any material event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition (other than
resulting from a breach of the merger agreement by Spirit) that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Spirit board of directors as of the date of
the merger agreement and becomes known to the Spirit board of directors after such date (which we refer to as an “intervening event”), if the Spirit board
of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel that, in light of such intervening event and taking into account the
results of any negotiations with JetBlue as provided by the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and any offer from JetBlue as provided by the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Spirit stockholders under applicable law. However, the Spirit board of directors may not withdraw, modify or amend the Spirit board of
directors recommendation in a manner adverse to JetBlue unless: (i) Spirit has provided prior written notice to JetBlue, at least four business days in
advance of Spirit’s intention to make a change of company board recommendation, which notice specifies the Spirit board of directors’ reason for
proposing to effect such change of company board recommendation and will describe in reasonable detail the intervening event; (ii) prior to effecting
such change of company board recommendation, Spirit has negotiated with JetBlue in good faith (to the extent JetBlue desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Spirit board of directors to effect
such change of company board recommendation; (iii) JetBlue has not, during the applicable notice period, made an offer to modify the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, which is set forth in a definitive written amendment to the merger agreement delivered to Spirit and executed on
behalf of JetBlue and Merger Sub, that the Spirit board of directors has in good faith determined (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) would obviate the need for the Spirit board of directors to effect such change of company board recommendation; and (iv) the
intervening event notice period has expired. For purposes of this proxy statement, acquisition proposal means, with respect to JetBlue or Spirit, any offer
or proposal from any person or group (other than JetBlue, Merger Sub or Spirit) concerning any, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
direct or indirect: (i) merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, which would result in any person or group (or the shareholders of any person or group) beneficially owning, directly or
indirectly, more than 20% or more of the voting power of JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, or 20% of the voting power of the surviving entity in a merger
involving JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, or the resulting direct or indirect parent of JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, or such surviving entity (or any
securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting power); (ii) sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license or other disposition
of assets of JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable, representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of JetBlue or Spirit (whether based on fair market value,
revenue generation or net income); (iii) issuance or sale by JetBlue or Spirit, as
98
Table of Contents
applicable, of equity interests representing, convertible into or exchangeable for 20% or more of the voting power of JetBlue or Spirit, as applicable; (iv)
transaction in which any person or entity will acquire beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership or any group has been formed
which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, equity interests representing 20% or more of the voting power of JetBlue or
Spirit, as applicable; (v) any tender offer of exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated would result, directly or
indirectly, in any person or group (or the shareholders of any person or group) beneficially owning 20% or more of the voting power of JetBlue or Spirit,
as applicable; or (vi) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the merger).
For purposes of this proxy statement, superior proposal means a bona fide written acquisition proposal (except the references therein to “20%” will be
replaced by “50%”) made by any person or group (other than JetBlue or any of its subsidiaries) after the date of the merger agreement, which acquisition
proposal did not result from a breach of the provisions of the merger agreement that relate to acquisition proposal, that the Spirit board of directors has
determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and with its financial advisors: (i) would, if consummated, result in
a transaction that is more favorable to Spirit stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the merger (after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms
that may be offered by JetBlue as provided by the terms and conditions of the merger agreement); and (ii) is reasonably capable of being consummated in
accordance with the terms of such acquisition proposal, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such acquisition proposal.
Proxy Statement; Spirit Special Meeting",104,107
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Proxy Statement; Spirit Special Meeting,"Proxy Statement; Spirit Special Meeting
Spirit agreed to prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the merger
agreement (and in any event, within twenty business days after the date of the merger agreement). Spirit further agreed to use its reasonable best efforts
to: (i) cause the preliminary proxy statement, when filed, to comply in all material respects with applicable law; and (ii) respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the preliminary proxy statement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the preliminary proxy statement, or response to related SEC comments, will be made by Spirit without JetBlue’s prior consent and without
providing JetBlue and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment. Spirit agreed to consider in good faith all comments reasonably
proposed by JetBlue. Spirit agreed to mail the proxy statement to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after Spirit learns that the
preliminary proxy statement will not be reviewed by the SEC or that the SEC has no further comments to the preliminary proxy statement (the “proxy
statement clearance date”). Spirit will promptly notify JetBlue upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the preliminary proxy statement, and will, as promptly as practicable after receipt, provide JetBlue with copies of all
material correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to
the proxy statement received from the SEC and advise JetBlue on any oral comments with respect to the proxy statement received from the SEC.
Spirit agreed to duly establish a record date for and duly call, give notice of and hold a meeting of its stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after
the proxy statement clearance date, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of the merger agreement, provided that the special meeting will not be
initially scheduled to occur later than forty-five days following the proxy statement clearance date. Spirit will not, without the consent of JetBlue, adjourn
or postpone, cancel, recess or reschedule, the special meeting; provided, however, that Spirit may postpone or adjourn the special meeting: (i) with the
prior written consent of JetBlue; (ii) if a quorum has not been established; (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which Spirit determines in good faith is reasonably likely to be required under applicable law; (iv) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies; or (v) if required by law, provided that such postponement or adjournment are subject to certain
limitations as set forth in the merger agreement, including a maximum length of postponement and adjournments of twenty business days from the
originally scheduled meeting date.
99Table of Contents
Spirit also agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and to take all
other actions necessary or advisable to secure approval from the Spirit stockholders. If at the time of the originally scheduled date of the special meeting,
a quorum has not been established or Spirit has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Spirit common stock for approval of
the merger agreement and transactions contemplated therein, then Spirit will, at the request of JetBlue (to the extent permitted by law), adjourn the special
meeting to a date specified by JetBlue. Without the prior written consent of JetBlue, the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will be the only matters (other than matters of procedure and matters required by law to be voted on by the Spirit
stockholders in connection with the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein) that Spirit will propose to be acted on
by the Spirit stockholders at the special meeting. Spirit also has agreed to submit the merger agreement for adoption by the Spirit stockholders at the
special meeting whether or not a change of company board recommendation has occurred.
Employee Matters",107,108
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Employee Matters,"Employee Matters
Through the first anniversary of the closing date of the merger, JetBlue has agreed to provide each continuing employee of Spirit (each, a “continuing
employee”) who is not covered by a Spirit collective bargaining agreement with: (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than that provided
by Spirit to such continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time; (ii) a target cash bonus opportunity and commissions opportunity that
are no less favorable in the aggregate that that provided by Spirit to such continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time; and (iii)
employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-based incentives and, subject to the merger agreement, severance benefits) that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than that provided by Spirit to such continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time. The employment terms and
conditions of each continuing employee whose employment is covered by a Spirit collective bargaining agreement will be governed by such applicable
collective bargaining agreement.
As of and following the effective time, JetBlue may elect to satisfy its obligations in respect of employee compensation and benefits by: (i) continuing
Spirit benefit plans with respect to continuing employees; (ii) permitting continuing employees and, as applicable, their eligible dependent to participate
in the employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any
vacation, sick or personal times off plans or programs) of JetBlue; or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii). If JetBlue elects to have continuing
employees and their eligible dependents participate in JetBlue’s benefit plans, programs or policies following the effective time, then JetBlue will use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) subject to certain customary exclusions, recognize the service of continuing employees with Spirit or any of its
predecessors for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefits to the same extent that such service was previously
recognized by Spirit as of the date of the merger agreement attributable to any period before the effective time; (ii) waive any pre-existing conditions (to
the extent waived under any corresponding Spirit benefit plan in which the continuing employee participated as of immediately prior to the effective time)
or actively at work or similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or required physical examinations with respect to
continuing employees and their eligible dependents under any health or similar plan of JetBlue; and (iii) cause any deductibles paid by continuing
employees under any Spirit health, dental, vision or similar plans in the plan year in which the continuing employee and their eligible dependents are
transferred to JetBlue’s health, dental, vision or similar plans to be credited towards deductibles under such plans of JetBlue or any of its subsidiaries.
Following the effective time, JetBlue will be bound by, honor and comply with the terms of certain employment, severance and change in control plans,
policies and agreements and other Spirit benefit plans (each, an “honored Spirit plan”).
Spirit and JetBlue have agreed that, if the closing of the merger occurs on or before December 31, 2023: (i) annual cash bonuses in respect of the period
between January 1, 2023, and the closing date will be paid to employees of Spirit within three business days following the closing of the merger in
amounts calculated based
100Table of Contents
on the level of performance attained as of immediately prior to the closing, as determined by the Spirit board of directors in accordance with applicable
performance and other customary criteria consistent with past practice, and prorated to reflect the portion of the 2023 performance period elapsed as of
the closing date; and (ii) JetBlue will pay continuing employees an annual bonus in respect of the 2023 fiscal year equal to the excess of (x) the annual
bonus payable under the applicable Spirit bonus plan for 2023 as in effect as of the closing date, calculated based on actual performance for the entire
2023 fiscal year, over (y) the bonus paid to such continuing employee pursuant to clause (i).
Spirit and JetBlue have further agreed that, if the closing of the merger occurs in 2024 but prior to the date on which annual cash bonuses in respect of
2023 are determined and paid, such bonus payments in respect of 2023, if any, will be calculated on the basis of actual performance for the 2023
performance period under the terms of the applicable Spirit bonus plan as will be determined by JetBlue’s board of directors in good faith using a
methodology reasonably consistent with the past practices of the Spirit board of directors. In addition, if the closing does not occur prior to March 1,
2024, then Spirit will, following prior consultation with JetBlue, be permitted to adopt performance goals with respect to an annual cash bonus program for
Spirit’s 2024 fiscal year in the ordinary course of business, and in such case JetBlue will honor such bonus program for continuing employees in
accordance with its terms (subject to commercially reasonable adjustments after the closing date as required for integration purposes). Except as
otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement or in an applicable severance plan adopted by Spirit, in each case, prior to the date of the
merger agreement or in accordance with the merger agreement, in order to be eligible to receive any bonus payment, a continuing employee must be
employed by either Spirit or JetBlue or any of JetBlue’s subsidiaries on the date the bonus is paid (or, with respect to any bonus period in 2023 ending on
or prior to the closing, the closing date), and if not so employed on such date, any bonus payment otherwise due to such individual will be forfeited.
Following the effective time, JetBlue will, or will cause one of its affiliates to, be bound by and comply with the terms of the Spirit collective bargaining
agreements as in effect as of the closing date until JetBlue or its affiliates negotiate a new collective agreement. JetBlue has also agreed to honor all
applicable seniority integration or similar rights contained in any Spirit collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.
The merger agreement does not require the continued employment of any Spirit employee and the provisions of the merger agreement related to service
providers do not create any rights for Spirit employees, and no provision of the merger agreement prevents JetBlue (or, following the effective time, Spirit)
from amending or terminating any employee benefit plans, programs, agreements, or arrangements.
From and after the date of the merger agreement until the effective time, Spirit has agreed that any material written or formal oral communications to
employees of Spirit regarding the terms and conditions of their employment (including compensation and benefits) following the merger will include the
applicable disclaimer set forth in the merger agreement and will be subject to prior review and (to the extent such communications are not limited to a
description or summary of the terms expressly set forth in the merger agreement or in an honored Spirit plan) approval by JetBlue and its outside counsel
(any such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Indemnification and Insurance",108,109
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Indemnification and Insurance,"Indemnification and Insurance
For a period of six years from and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will, and JetBlue will cause the surviving corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of Spirit to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of the
date of the merger agreement by Spirit pursuant to applicable law, Spirit’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Spirit’s Amended and
Restated Bylaws, and the indemnification agreements in existence on the date of the merger agreement with any directors, officers and employees of Spirit
arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of Spirit occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger. The
surviving corporation will, and JetBlue will cause the surviving corporation to, advance expenses (including
101Table of Contents
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any suit, claim, action, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding with respect
to the matters, subject to indemnification pursuant to the merger agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in the governing documents of
Spirit and the indemnification agreements in existence on the date of the merger agreement.
For a period of six years from and after the effective time of the merger, JetBlue will cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving
corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification of directors and officers of Spirit for periods at or
prior to the effective time of the merger than are currently set forth in Spirit’s governing documents. The surviving corporation will cause the
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of Spirit to continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the effective time.
The surviving corporation will either: (i) obtain a tail insurance policy with a claims period of at least six years from the effective time with respect to
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as Spirit’s existing policies for claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or prior to the effective time; or (ii) maintain in effect for six years from the effective time, if available, the current directors’ and officers’
liability insurance policies maintained by Spirit, provided that the surviving corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than Spirit’s existing policy with
respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time.
However, the surviving corporation will not be required to pay an annual premium for the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of the merger agreement. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence will be deemed to
be satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the effective time, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events occurring on or before the effective time. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained prior to the effective time of the merger, JetBlue will cause the surviving corporation to maintain such policies in full force and effect and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
In the event JetBlue or the surviving corporation: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other entity and will not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then
proper provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, will assume the
obligations set forth in the merger agreement with respect to indemnification and insurance.
The obligations described in this section will: (i) continue, notwithstanding any six-year limitation referred to above, until the final disposition of any suit,
action, proceeding or investigation brought or commenced during such six-year period; and (ii) not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any indemnitee to whom the provisions of the merger agreement relating to insurance and indemnification applies without the consent of
such affected indemnitee. The parties expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom the provisions of the merger agreement relating to insurance and
indemnification apply will be third-party beneficiaries of such provisions of the merger agreement.",109,110

Access to Information; Confidentiality
Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement to which Spirit is a party, and except as would
reasonably be expected to result in the loss or waiver of any attorney-client, work product or other applicable privilege (provided, that to the extent Spirit
or any Spirit representative withholds
102Table of Contents
information or access due to the risk of loss or waiver of such privilege, Spirit or such Spirit representative will notify JetBlue of such withholding and use
commercially reasonable efforts to communicate such information in a manner that does not risk such loss or waiver), from entry into the merger
agreement to the effective time,
Spirit agreed to: (i) provide to JetBlue and Merger Sub and their respective representatives reasonable access at reasonable times during normal operating
hours to the books and records of Spirit upon prior written notice; and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties,
contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of Spirit as JetBlue or its representatives may reasonably request. However, any investigation of
JetBlue or its representatives will be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of Spirit.
Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings
Each of JetBlue and Spirit agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement as promptly as practicable; and (ii) obtain from any governmental entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, confirmations, clearances, certificates, exemptions, registrations or orders required to be obtained by JetBlue or Spirit or any of their
respective subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any governmental entity (including those in connection with the HSR Act), in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.
Neither JetBlue nor Spirit, in connection with the receipt of any necessary license, permit, waiver, approval, authorization or order of a governmental
entity (including under the HSR Act), will be required to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business (or, following the closing,
the combined business) in a specified manner, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business (or, following the closing,
the combined business) in a specified manner, or enter into or agree to enter into a voting trust arrangement, proxy arrangement, “hold separate”
agreement or arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to the assets, operations or conduct of their business (or, following the
closing, the combined business) in a specified manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of JetBlue, Spirit or their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates (we refer to each such action as a “divestiture action”), if such divestiture action would or would reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse effect on JetBlue and its subsidiaries (including Spirit and its subsidiaries) after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, taken as a whole. However: (i) JetBlue agreed to take the divestiture actions with respect to any of Spirit’s
holdings at Boston Logan International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport and
five gates and related ground facilities at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport; (ii) subject to the other provisions of the merger agreement,
the identity of any additional divestiture actions will be determined by JetBlue in its sole and absolute discretion; and (iii) in no event will JetBlue be
required to agree to or effect any divestiture action that in JetBlue’s discretion would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the
anticipated benefits of the parties to the NEA and the agreements contemplated thereby. At JetBlue’s request, Spirit will reasonably assist JetBlue with
any sales process with respect to any business or assets proposed to be subject to a divestiture action.
JetBlue will control and lead all communications and strategy relating to obtaining all approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations from any governmental entity or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the merger and other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry or litigation by or before, or any negotiations with, a
governmental entity; provided, however, that JetBlue will consult in advance with Spirit and in good faith take Spirit’s views into account regarding the
overall strategic direction of any such litigation or approval process, as applicable, and consult with Spirit prior to taking any material substantive
positions, making dispositive motions or other material substantive filings or submissions or entering into any negotiations concerning such litigation or
approvals, as applicable.

Spirit Special Meeting
Spirit has agreed to hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the merger agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable and upon other related matters. Except to the extent that the Spirit board of directors has made a recommendation change with respect to a
Superior Proposal (as defined in the merger agreement), the Spirit board of directors is required to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
stockholders the vote required to adopt the merger agreement, including by communicating to its stockholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in this proxy statement) that they adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Notwithstanding any Spirit change in recommendation, unless the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, Spirit is required to
convene a meeting of its stockholders and to submit the merger agreement to a vote of such stockholders. Spirit must, at the request of JetBlue (to the
extent permitted by Law), adjourn or postpone such meeting if there are insufficient shares of Spirit common stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Spirit has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary for approval of the merger agreement.
Certain Notices
From and after the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger, each party thereto will promptly notify the other party thereto of: (i)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would or would be reasonably likely to (a) cause any condition to the obligations of any party to
effect the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement not to be satisfied or (b) prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement; (ii) the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to the merger agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of
any party to effect the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement not to be satisfied; (iii) receipt of any written notice to the
receiving party from any person alleging that the consent or approval of such person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and the pursuit of such consent would (in the good faith determination of such party) reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or (iv) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any governmental entity, the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (or any other securities market) in connection with the merger;
provided, however, that the delivery of any such notice will not limit, cure any breach of or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in the merger agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available under the merger agreement to the party receiving such
notice. Spirit will promptly notify JetBlue of any action (or threats of action) by the FAA or the DOT that materially amends, modifies, suspends, revokes,
terminates, cancels or withdraws any Spirit permit or slots.
Public Announcements
Each of Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub agreed that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement will be issued by any party without the prior written consent of Spirit and JetBlue (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement, including as such release or announcement may be required by applicable
law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or governmental entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement will use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

State Takeover Laws
If any “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “business combination” or other anti-takeover laws becomes or is deemed to be applicable to Spirit,
JetBlue, Merger Sub or the merger, including the acquisition of shares of Spirit common stock pursuant thereto or any other transaction contemplated by
the merger agreement, then the Spirit board of directors will take all action necessary to render such law inapplicable to such entities and transactions.
JetBlue Agreement Concerning Merger Sub
JetBlue will cause Merger Sub to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement.
Section 16 Matters
Prior to the effective time of the Merger, the Spirit board of directors, or a duly authorized committee of non-employee directors thereof, will adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of Spirit who is a covered person of Spirit
for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (which we refer to as “Section 16”) of shares of Spirit common stock will be an exempt transaction for
purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
Spirit Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration
Spirit and JetBlue will cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the delisting of shares of Spirit common stock from the NYSE
and the deregistration of such shares of Spirit common stock as promptly as practicable following the effective time of the merger in compliance with
applicable law.
Stockholder Litigation
Spirit will promptly provide JetBlue with any pleadings and correspondence relating to any suit, claim, action, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other
proceeding involving Spirit or any of its officers or directors or any other of its representatives relating to the merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and will keep JetBlue reasonably and promptly informed regarding the status of any suit, claim, action, hearing,
arbitration, investigation or other proceeding. Spirit will cooperate with and give JetBlue a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any such suit, claim, action, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the
prior written consent of JetBlue (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Spirit will also give JetBlue the right to review
and comment on all filings or responses to be made by it in connection with any such suit, claim, action, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other
proceeding, and it will in good faith take such comments into account.
Tax Matters
Except for payment of any transfer or other taxes required by reason of payment of the merger consideration to a person other than the holder of record of
a certificate(s) representing Spirit common stock, each of Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub will pay any sales, use, ad valorem, property, transfer (including
real property transfer) and similar taxes imposed on Spirit, JetBlue or Merger Sub, as the case may be, as a result of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated under the merger agreement. The parties agreed to cooperate in good faith to prepare and timely deliver any certificate or instrument
necessary for a party to the merger agreement to claim an applicable exemption from any such taxes otherwise payable.

Within the time periods required by the terms of the applicable indenture for Spirit’s 2025 convertible notes and 2026 convertible notes (which we
collectively refer to as the “convertible notes indenture”), Spirit agreed to take
105
Table of Contents
all actions required by, or all commercially reasonable actions requested by JetBlue pursuant to and in compliance with, the convertible notes indenture to
be performed by Spirit as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including (i) the giving of any notices that may be required by the convertible notes indenture or reasonably requested by JetBlue,
and (ii) delivery to the trustee, the holders of Spirit’s convertible notes or other applicable person, as applicable, of any instruments, certificates, opinions
of Spirit’s counsel or other documents required by the convertible notes indenture or reasonably requested by JetBlue in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of the merger agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby or as otherwise required by, or reasonably requested by JetBlue
pursuant to or in compliance with, the convertible notes indenture. Spirit also agreed to deliver a copy of any such notice, instrument, certificate, opinion
or other document to JetBlue at least three business days (or such shorter period of time as may be required to comply with the terms of the convertible
notes indenture) prior to delivering such notice or entering into such other document or instrument, and to consider any reasonable comments thereto
proposed by JetBlue in good faith. Spirit and the surviving corporation will execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered, as applicable), in
accordance with the convertible notes indenture, supplemental indentures and any other documents or instruments as may be requested by the trustee in
connection with the execution of such supplemental indentures, in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the trustee and Spirit,
pursuant to and with such terms as required under the convertible notes indenture.
Prior to the effective time and without the written consent of JetBlue, Spirit will not take any action that would result in an adjustment to the “Conversion
Rate” (as defined in the convertible notes indenture) of Spirit’s convertible notes, other than in connection with the entry into or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Except as provided for in the merger agreement, prior to the Effective Time and without the written consent of JetBlue, Spirit will not amend the
convertible notes indenture. Prior to the effective time, Spirit will comply with all requirements of the convertible notes indenture. Following the effective
time, the surviving corporation will comply with all requirements of the convertible notes indenture.
Prior to the effective time, Spirit will settle any conversions of (i) Spirit’s 2025 convertible notes pursuant to “Physical Settlement” (as defined in the
applicable indenture) and (ii) Spirit’s 2026 convertible notes pursuant to “Cash Settlement” (as defined in the applicable indenture).
Financing
JetBlue will, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange the debt financing and to
consummate the debt financing on the closing date. Such actions will include using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the debt commitment
letter (except as otherwise permitted under the merger agreement) until the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated or the
merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; (ii) cause senior management of JetBlue to participate in, and assist with, the preparation of
rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or, if deemed advisable by JetBlue, seek a waiver on a timely
basis of) all debt financing conditions within its control; (iv) negotiate, execute and deliver debt financing documents that reflect the terms contained in
the debt commitment letter (including any “market flex” provisions related thereto) or on such other terms no less favorable to JetBlue than those set
forth in the debt commitment letter; and (v) in the event that the conditions to the obligations of Spirit, JetBlue and Merger Sub to consummate the
merger and the debt financing conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, enforce JetBlue’s rights under the debt commitment
letter in the event of a financing failure event (as defined and further described in the merger agreement), that prevents, impedes or
delays the closing of the merger. JetBlue will use reasonable best efforts to give Spirit prompt notice of any material breach or repudiation by any lender
or other financing sources to the debt commitment letter of which JetBlue obtains knowledge.
106
Table of Contents
Spirit will, and will cause its representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide JetBlue all cooperation and take all corporate action required, as
reasonably requested by JetBlue in connection with the arrangement, marketing and consummate of the debt financing. JetBlue will promptly reimburse
Spirit for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Spirit in performing its obligation to
cooperate with JetBlue in connection with the debt financing, and JetBlue will indemnify Spirit for all liabilities and losses incurred by Spirit and its
representatives in connection with the debt financing other than to the extent any liabilities or losses arise from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of, or material breach of the merger agreement by, Spirit or any of its representatives.
JetBlue Tax Indemnification
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and as more fully described therein, JetBlue has agreed to indemnify Spirit for
certain income tax losses arising from a final determination, or settlement of a claim, that Spirit is required to recognize the approval prepayment and/or the
additional prepayments as income or gain for income tax purposes or that the Spirit termination fee (as defined in the section “—Transaction Expenses
and Termination Fee”) is non-deductible to Spirit. In the event that Spirit utilizes any net operating losses or other tax attributes to reduce or offset any
income tax losses that would have otherwise been indemnifiable, JetBlue is required to pay to Spirit any tax benefit that Spirit would have realized with
respect to such tax attributes in a future tax period “as and when” such tax benefits would have been realized and determined on a “with and without”
basis, taking into account such tax attributes as the last items claimed for any taxable year. Spirit has agreed to cooperate with JetBlue and provide
JetBlue with any material information that it may reasonably request in connection with an indemnifiable income tax loss or a tax proceeding relating
thereto. The indemnification obligations of JetBlue generally survive until sixty days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
Frontier Expense Reimbursement
Within three business days of Spirit providing JetBlue with evidence of the expense reimbursement amount of up to $25.0 million paid by Spirit to Frontier
pursuant to the Frontier merger agreement, JetBlue paid such amount to Spirit by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated
by Spirit.

In each case described below, the merger agreement may be terminated and the merger abandoned by action taken or authorized by the board or boards

to the effective time. In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by either party if:
•
any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental entity has issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger, which order or other action has become final and non-appealable (which order the party
seeking to terminate the merger agreement has used its reasonable best efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable, as required by the

proposal in accordance with the provisions in the merger agreement; or
•
there is: (i) an uncured inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or breach of any covenant of the merger agreement by either JetBlue or
Merger Sub that would result in the failure of the conditions to the obligation of Spirit to effect the merger to be satisfied; (ii) Spirit has
delivered to JetBlue written notice of such inaccuracy or breach; and (iii) such inaccuracy or breach is not capable of cure or, if curable, has
not been cured in all material respects prior to the earlier of the outside date and thirty days after the notice of breach. Spirit cannot
terminate for this reason if it has breached any covenant such that the condition to the merger relating to performance of Spirit’s covenants
is not satisfied or there is an uncured inaccuracy in any of Spirit’s representations and warranties such that the condition to the merger
relating to the truth and accuracy of Spirit’s representations and warranties is not satisfied.
The merger agreement may be terminated by JetBlue if:

All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the merger is consummated.
However, Spirit must pay JetBlue a termination fee of $94.2 million if:
•
Spirit terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal;
•
JetBlue terminates the merger agreement in connection with a triggering event; or
•
(i) the merger agreement is terminated (a) on the outside date, (b) because there is an intentional breach of Spirit’s covenant with respect to
non-solicitation or the special meeting or (c) because the required

Spirit stockholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting; (ii) prior to
the date of the special meeting (or prior to the termination of the merger agreement if there has been no special meeting) an acquisition
proposal has been publicly announced and is not withdrawn; and (iii) at any time on or prior to the first anniversary of the termination of
the merger agreement, Spirit consummates any acquisition proposal or enters into a definitive written agreement providing for the
consummation of an alternative acquisition proposal that is ultimately consummated; provided that for purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), the
references to “20%” in the meaning of acquisition proposal are deemed to be references to “50%.”
In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by either JetBlue or Spirit because the Spirit stockholder approval of the merger proposal is not
obtained at the special meeting, then Spirit will pay to JetBlue the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by JetBlue in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement up to $25.0 million. Any
payment of the expense reimbursement will reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, any termination fee that becomes due and payable under the merger
agreement. In addition, upon the termination of the merger agreement by JetBlue because of a material, uncured breach by Spirit of the merger agreement,
Spirit will pay to JetBlue an amount (which we refer to as the “Spirit termination fee”) equal to the sum of all amounts previously paid by JetBlue as part of
the approval prepayment and additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders.
In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by either Spirit or JetBlue because: (i) a governmental entity has issued an order or taken any other
action permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger under applicable U.S. federal competition laws; or (ii) the merger has not occurred by
the outside date solely because of the failure to satisfy the closing condition requiring (a) the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the
merger under the HSR Act to have expired or been terminated or (b) that no governmental entity has issued an order or taken any other action enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the merger under applicable U.S. federal competition laws, and that no applicable competition law will be in effect making the
merger illegal or preventing the consummation of the merger, and at the time of either such termination all other closing conditions have been satisfied (or
are capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on such date of termination); then: (i) JetBlue will pay directly to the Spirit stockholders as of a
record date that is five business days following the date of such termination the excess of (A) $400.0 million minus (B) the sum of all amounts previously
paid by JetBlue as part of the approval prepayment and additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders, and will pay to Spirit a corresponding amount
payable to the holders of Spirit restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards; and (ii) JetBlue will pay Spirit a fee in the amount of $70.0
million, in each case within two business days following the date of such termination. However, none of the foregoing payments will be payable by
JetBlue if the failure to satisfy the conditions described in this paragraph is the result of a breach by Spirit of its obligations in the provisions described

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER",121,122
Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER,"MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
The following is a general discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each as
defined below) of Spirit common stock that exchange their shares of Spirit common stock for cash in the merger. The following discussion is based upon
the Code, the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative authorities, rulings and decisions, all as in effect as of the
date of this proxy statement. These authorities may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of
2010 (including the U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection
therewith) nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction, or under any U.S. federal laws other
than those pertaining to the income tax.
The following discussion applies only to holders of Spirit common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
might be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances and does not apply to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal
income tax laws (such as, for example, dealers or brokers in securities, commodities or foreign currencies; traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-
to-market method of accounting; banks and certain other financial institutions; insurance companies; mutual funds; tax-exempt organizations; holders
subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code; persons who are required to recognize income or gain with respect to the merger no later
than such income or gain is required to be reported on an applicable financial statement under Section 451(b) of the Code; partnerships, S corporations or
other pass-through entities (or investors therein); regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; former citizens or residents of the
United States; U.S. expatriates; U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; holders who hold shares of Spirit common stock as part of a
hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction or other integrated investment; holders who acquired Spirit common stock pursuant to the
exercise of employee stock options, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation; holders who exercise appraisal rights; or
holders who actually or constructively own more than 5% of Spirit’s common stock).
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a holder of Spirit common stock, the tax treatment of a partner
in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes that is a holder of Spirit common stock, and any partners in such partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the
tax consequences of the merger in light of their specific circumstances.
All holders of Spirit common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of the merger in light of their
particular facts and circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, foreign and other tax laws.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Spirit common stock
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Spirit common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (1)
an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation, or entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, organized in
or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (3) a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (b) such trust has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (4) an estate, the income of which is
includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, regardless of its source.
114Table of Contents
The exchange of shares of Spirit common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. A U.S. holder of Spirit common stock generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount of
merger consideration received by the U.S. holder and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Spirit common stock surrendered in
exchange therefor. Gain or loss must be calculated separately for each block of Spirit common stock exchanged by such U.S. holder if such blocks were
acquired at different times or for different prices. Any gain or loss recognized generally would be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding
period in a particular block of Spirit common stock exceeds one year at the time of the merger. Long-term capital gain of certain non-corporate U.S. holders
(including individuals) currently is eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the per-share amount of cash payable by JetBlue as merger consideration in the merger is reduced by the sum
of (1) the approval prepayment amount and (2) the lesser of (i) $1.15 and (ii) the aggregate additional prepayment amount. See the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Prepayments.” The tax treatment of the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit
stockholders is not clear. The parties have agreed to report the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments to the Spirit stockholders as
amounts paid by JetBlue to, and for the benefit of, the Spirit stockholders for U.S. federal income tax and all other applicable tax purposes. Assuming that
this characterization applies, the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments could be treated as merger consideration paid before the closing of
the merger (with a corresponding adjustment to the gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder when such U.S. holder sells or exchanges its shares of Spirit
common stock); as gain realized by a U.S. holder in respect of a separate right or obligation with respect to its shares of Spirit common stock (e.g., if the
merger is not consummated or if a U.S. holder disposes of its shares before the closing of the merger); or potentially as ordinary income to the U.S. holder.
It is also possible that the IRS could disagree with the above characterization and seek to characterize the approval prepayment and/or the additional
prepayments in a different manner.
U.S. holders of Spirit common stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the approval prepayment and the additional

For purposes of this discussion, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Spirit common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or
arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Any gain realized by a non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such non-U.S. holder in the United States), in
which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if such non-U.S.
holder is a foreign corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax equal to 30% of such non-U.S. holder’s effectively
connected earnings and profits (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
•
such non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares
of Spirit common stock for cash pursuant to the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) and may be offset by certain U.S.
source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year; or
•
Spirit is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code (“USRPHC”)
at any time within the shorter of the five-year period ending
115
Table of Contents
on the date of the merger and such non-U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of Spirit common stock, which we
refer to as the “relevant period,” and such non-U.S. holder owned (actually or constructively) more than 5% of the shares of Spirit common
stock at any time during the relevant period. Spirit believes that Spirit is not, and has not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year
period preceding the merger.
As discussed above under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Spirit common stock,” the tax treatment of the
approval prepayment and the additional prepayments is not clear. The approval prepayment and the additional prepayments could be treated as merger
consideration paid before the closing of the merger, which should be treated in the same manner as the merger consideration paid to a non-U.S. holder in
the merger. Alternatively, it is possible that the approval prepayment and the additional prepayments could be treated as fixed or determinable annual or
periodical (FDAP) income to a non-U.S. holder, in which case it could be treated either as non-U.S. source or as U.S. source FDAP income. If treated as
non-U.S. source FDAP income, the approval prepayment and additional prepayments received by a non-U.S. holder should not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax. U.S. source FDAP income received by a non-U.S. holder is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30% (or a lower
rate under an applicable income tax treaty), unless the income is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such non-U.S. holder in the
United States), in which case such income generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if such
non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such income may also be subject to the branch profits tax equal to 30% of such non-U.S. holder’s effectively
connected earnings and profits (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty). In light of the uncertainty as to the tax treatment of the approval
prepayment and the additional prepayments, there is a meaningful possibility that a broker, dealer, bank or other custodian that holds shares of Spirit
common stock beneficially owned by a non-U.S. holder may withhold at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire
amount of the approval prepayment and/or the additional prepayments.
Non-U.S. holders of Spirit common stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the approval prepayment and the
additional prepayments to them in light of their particular circumstances.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%) may apply to payments of cash made to a holder of Spirit common stock
pursuant to the merger or to the approval prepayment or the additional prepayments.
Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. holder of Spirit common stock that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding on a properly completed IRS Form W-9 or (2) a non-U.S. holder of Spirit common stock
that furnishes a certification of such non-U.S. holder’s foreign status on a properly completed applicable IRS Form W-8 or otherwise establishes an
exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability if the required information is supplied to the IRS in a timely manner.
This discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, tax advice. All holders of
Spirit common stock should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations as
well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing
jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

CONFIDENTIAL

Board of Directors
Spirit Airlines, Inc.

Miramar, Florida 33025
Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that Spirit Airlines, Inc. (the “Company”) intends to enter into a transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”) with JetBlue Airways
Corporation (“Parent”) and Sundown Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. We
further understand that, at the effective time of the Merger, among other things, each share of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share
(“Company Common Stock”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than any Dissenting Shares (as defined in the
Agreement (as defined below) and any shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, owned of record by Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries (together, the “Excluded Shares”) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined in the Agreement) (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction are set forth in more detail in
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated on or about July 28, 2022, by and among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (the “Agreement”), including
aggregate payments of $400 million to be made by Parent to the stockholders of the Company and an additional payment of $70 million to be made by
Parent to the Company in the event of the exercise of certain termination rights, as set forth in the Agreement. The summary of the Proposed Transaction
set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement.
We have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render our opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
to the Company’s stockholders (other than holders of the Excluded Shares) of the Consideration to be received by such stockholders in the Proposed
Transaction. We have not been requested to opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the Company’s underlying business decision
to proceed with or effect the Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of consummation of the Proposed Transaction. In addition, we express no opinion
on, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees
of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be offered to the stockholders of the Company
in the Proposed Transaction or otherwise. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Proposed Transaction as compared to any other
transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage, including the transaction set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
February 5, 2022, by and among Frontier Group Holdings, Inc., Top Gun Acquisition Corp. and the Company (the “Prior Transaction”), which transaction
you have advised us has been terminated.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) a draft of the Agreement, dated July 26, 2022 and the specific terms of the Proposed
Transaction; (2) publicly available information concerning the Company and Parent that we believe to be relevant to our analysis, including the
Company’s and Parent’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s and Parent’s Quarterly Reports on
B-1Table of Contents
Page 2 of 3
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022; (3) financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of
the Company furnished to us by the Company, including financial projections of the Company prepared by management of the Company (the “Company
Projections”); (4) a trading history of the Company Common Stock from July 26, 2017 to July 26, 2022 and a comparison of that trading history with those
of other companies that we deemed relevant; (5) published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance
and price targets of the Company; and (6) a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of the Company with those of
other companies that we deemed relevant. In addition, we have had discussions with the management of the Company concerning its business,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects and have undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed
appropriate.
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by us
without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such
information) and have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Company Projections, upon the advice of the Company, we have assumed that
such projections have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the
Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and that the Company will perform substantially in accordance with such projections.
We assume no responsibility for and we express no view as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they are based. In arriving
at our opinion, we have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and have not made or obtained any
evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company. Our opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic and other conditions as
they exist on, and can be evaluated as of, the date of this letter. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on events or
circumstances that may occur after the date of this letter.
We have assumed that the executed Agreement will conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed by us. In addition, we have assumed
the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and all agreements related thereto. We have also assumed, upon the
advice of the Company, that all material governmental, regulatory and third party approvals, consents and releases for the Proposed Transaction will be
obtained within the constraints contemplated by the Agreement and that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of
the Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. We do not express any opinion as to any
tax or other consequences that might result from the Proposed Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters,
as to which we understand that the Company has obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.

Amount. For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, and with your consent, we have assumed that the Merger Consideration is $33.50 per share. The
terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined shall

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant

Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.
We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or
supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the financial projections, we
have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the
definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection
with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations,
conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed
Merger. We do not express any view on, and this opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in
connection therewith. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification,
the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with
respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such
persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) in
the transaction. We express no opinion with respect to the treatment of the Company Convertible Notes or the Company Warrants pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished
with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in
preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
In arriving at our opinion, we were not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition, business
combination or other extraordinary transaction, involving the Company.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a
portion of which is contingent upon the rendering of this financial opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the
Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory and financing services for the Company and financing services for
Parent and have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to
Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.
Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management
businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and

the Company, their respective affiliates or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related
derivative instrument.
Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger

Agreement and does not address the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to other business or
financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to enter into the Merger
Agreement or proceed with any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our customary
practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without
our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition, this opinion does not
in any manner address the prices at which the Company Common Stock will trade at any time and Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or
recommendation as to how the shareholders of Company should vote at the shareholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the Merger or whether
to take any other actions in connection with the Merger.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock.

which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter
of transmittal, which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates (if any) will pass, only upon
delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent, and will otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the
Paying Agent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the
holder of such Certificates will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates.
Any Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. If payment
of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it will
be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and the Person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will have established to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable. Any holder of non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one (1) or
more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within three (3) Business
Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration payable for each such Book-Entry Share. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement.

(c)
Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and
thereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect
to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, then (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.2(b)) they will be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.
(d)
Termination of Payment Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest
accrued with respect thereto) not disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b). If, prior to six (6) years after the Effective Time
(or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Certificates has not complied
with the procedures in Section 2.2(b) to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the
payment in respect of such Certificates will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(e)
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a customary affidavit of loss and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
(f)
Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and any other applicable withholding
agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares or any other Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided, that
withholding for Merger Consideration or other payments received in respect of Company RSU Awards, Company Performance Share
Awards and 2022 Company Performance Share Awards shall be effected as cash and net share withholding in proportion to the type of
consideration payable to the holder thereof. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or other Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.",136,137

respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the “Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and will instead represent the right to receive only the payment provided by

Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to receive such payment in respect of such Dissenting Shares will cease and such Dissenting Shares
will be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and will be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and shall no longer be Dissenting Shares. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent will have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any
to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any

such Government Support Law restrictions, and (ii) Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be paid at the earliest time permitted

Spirit Airlines MA.Pdf,Financing,"Financing. The Parent Group collectively will have, as of the Closing Date, sufficient cash and cash equivalents, available lines of credit or other
sources of immediately available funds to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that require
payment on the Closing Date. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter (other than
the redacted portions of any fee letters, which redactions shall be limited to pricing, fee amounts, price flex and other economic terms and in no case
shall such redactions relate to terms that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing). The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other commitment or arrangement
relating to the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could affect the availability of the Debt Financing or the timing of
the Closing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letters related thereto. The proceeds of the Debt Financing (both
before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all “market flex” provisions related thereto), together with any other sources of funds
immediately available to Parent or Merger Sub at Closing (including cash and cash equivalents and available lines of credit held by the Company
(assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement and the performance by the Company of
its obligations hereunder) and the proceeds of the loans under existing revolving credit facilities of Parent), will be sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Debt Commitment Parties, to provide the financing contemplated
thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and, subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of creditors. Parent has fully
paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with the Debt Financing. As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent under any term of the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, assuming the conditions precedent set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 are satisfied (other than those that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), Parent has no reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or (ii) the
Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full
amount of

the Debt Financing other than the Financing Conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent understands and acknowledges that
under the terms of this Agreement, the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are not in any way contingent upon or
otherwise subject to the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of any financing arrangements, the obtaining by Parent or Merger Sub of any
financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Parent or Merger Sub.

Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (i) the sum of the value of all “liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities,” as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such
debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such
date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or

Proposal from a third party that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3 and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement that have been delivered to the Company by Parent in writing during the Notice Period (or any
extension thereof) provided pursuant to this Section 5.3(f), and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that a failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation and/or cause the Company to enter

the fiduciary duties owed by the directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then, prior to the time
(but not after) the Company Required Vote is obtained, the Company Board may take the following actions: (y) effect a Change of Board
Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal or (z) terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement

Company’s intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being understood that the delivery of such notice
and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment will not, by itself,
constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice will specify the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including all of the information that is specified in Section 5.3(c)), and the Company
has contemporaneously provided a copy of all relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior
Proposal;
(ii)
prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company will, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, that in the event of any material revisions to the Superior
Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.3(f) with respect to such new written notice; provided, further, that the Notice Period for any subsequent notice will be shortened
from four (4) Business Days to two (2) Business Days; and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the time (but not after) the Company Required Vote is
obtained, the Company Board may make a Change of Board Recommendation for an Intervening Event if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event and taking into account the
results of any negotiations with Parent as contemplated by subsection (ii) below and any offer from Parent contemplated by subsection (iii)
below, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the directors
of the Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may not withdraw,
modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing unless:

the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the “Intervening Event
Notice Period”), of the Company’s intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation (it being understood that the delivery of
such notice and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment shall not, by
itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the
Company Board’s reason for proposing to effect such Change of Board Recommendation and shall describe in reasonable detail the
Intervening Event;

(ii)
prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company shall, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Change of Board Recommendation;
(iii)
Parent shall not have, within the Intervening Event Notice Period, made an offer to modify the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, which is set forth in a definitive written amendment to this Agreement delivered to the Company and executed on behalf
of Parent and Merger Sub, that the Company Board has in good faith determined (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor) would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and

the Intervening Event Notice Period shall have expired.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company (i) from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders that the Company Board determines to make in good
faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties under, or in order to otherwise comply with, applicable
Law, in each case, so long as (A) any such disclosure includes the Company Board Recommendation without any modification thereof, and

(a)
As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later than twenty (20) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Company
Stockholder Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the “Proxy Statement”). The Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Proxy Statement, when filed, to comply in all material respects with all legal requirements
applicable thereto and (ii) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff
concerning the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement, or response to SEC comments with
respect thereto, will be made by the Company without Parent’s prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and without providing Parent and its outside counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company
shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent; provided, however, that the Company, in connection with a
Change of Board Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a
Qualifying Amendment to effect such change, and in such event, the right of approval set forth in this Section 5.4(a) shall apply only with
respect to such information relating to Parent or Merger Sub, and shall be subject to the right of Parent to have its board of directors’
deliberations and conclusions be accurately described therein. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date. The Company will promptly notify Parent upon the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and will, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of all material correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise the
other on any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the
Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include
a misstatement of a material fact or omit to
A-37Table of Contents
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by law, disseminated to the Company stockholders. Parent shall promptly provide such information regarding Parent and Merger
Sub that the Company may reasonably request for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.
(b)
The Company shall duly establish a record date for and duly call, give notice of and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the “Company
Stockholder Meeting”) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date for the purpose of voting on the
adoption of this Agreement, provided that the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be initially scheduled to occur later than forty-five
(45) days following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date. In furtherance of the foregoing and in consultation with Parent, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall set a preliminary record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting and
commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act. The Company shall not, without the consent of Parent, adjourn
or postpone, cancel, recess or reschedule, the Company Stockholder Meeting; provided, however, that the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; (ii) if a quorum has not been established; (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is reasonably
likely to be required under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Company’s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting; (iv) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies, if
and to the extent the Company reasonably believes the requisite Company Stockholder Approval would not otherwise be obtained; or (v) if
required by Law; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be
postponed or adjourned (x) to a date later than the third (3rd) Business Day preceding the Outside Date (as it may be extended pursuant to
Section 7.1(e)) or (y) for more than ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate from the Originally Scheduled Date, in each case, without the
prior written consent of Parent; provided, further, that in no event shall the Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed or adjourned
pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) and Section 5.4(c) by more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate from the Originally Scheduled
Date. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last seven (7)
Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with
respect to the Company Stockholder Approval.
(c)
Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement, and to take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if, at the time of the Originally Scheduled Date, a quorum has not been established or the Company
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Company Stockholder Approval, then the Company shall, at the
request of Parent (to the extent permitted by Law), adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to a date specified by Parent; provided, that
the Company shall not be required pursuant to this sentence to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two (2) times or for
more than ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate from the Originally Scheduled Date; provided, further, that in no event shall the
Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed or adjourned pursuant to this Section 5.4(c) and Section 5.4(b) by more than twenty (20)
Business Days in the aggregate from the Originally Scheduled Date. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be the only matters (other than matters of procedure and matters
required by Law to be voted on by the stockholders of the Company in connection with the adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company will propose to be acted on by the stockholders of
A-38

the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Article 7, the Company’s obligations to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to this Section 5.4 will not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or by
any Change of Board Recommendation.

agreement to form a joint venture, strategic alliance or strategic partnership with another Person, in each case (1) and (2), if the entering into

(a)
For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent will provide, or will cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company
who continues to be employed by a member of the Parent Group (individually, a “Continuing Employee” and collectively, “Continuing
Employees”) who is not covered by a Company CBA with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than the base salary or
wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target cash bonus opportunity and
commissions opportunity that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the target cash bonus opportunity and commissions opportunity
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits (excluding equity and
equity-based incentives and, subject to Section 5.8(d), severance benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than employee
benefits (excluding equity and equity-based incentives and, subject to Section 5.8(d), severance benefits) provided to such Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The employment terms and conditions of each Continuing Employee whose
employment is covered by a Company CBA shall be governed by the applicable Company CBA.
(b)
As of and following the Effective Time, Parent may satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section 5.8(a) in respect of employee benefits by (i)
continuing Company Benefit Plans with respect to Continuing Employees, (ii) permitting Continuing Employees and, as applicable, their
eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including any plan intended to qualify within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, or personal time off plans or programs) of Parent, or (iii) a combination of
clauses (i) and (ii). To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents participate in its employee
benefit plans, program or policies following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans in which Continuing
Employees are entitled to participate to treat, the service of Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its predecessors to the
extent previously recognized by the Company as of the date hereof attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service rendered
to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate
benefits including the applicability of minimum waiting periods for participation, but excluding benefit accrual (including minimum pension
amount) under equity incentive plans, defined benefit pension plans or retiree welfare benefit plans of Parent, or as would otherwise result
in a duplication of benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing
conditions or actively at work or similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or required physical
examinations under any health or similar plan of Parent to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents;
provided, however, that with respect to preexisting conditions, such conditions shall be waived to the extent waived under the
corresponding plan in which Continuing Employees participated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall also use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any deductibles paid by Continuing Employees under any of the Company’s health, dental, vision
or similar plans in the plan year in which Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents are transitioned to Parent’s health, dental,
vision or similar plans to be credited towards deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent.
(c)
If the Closing occurs on or before December 31, 2023, (i) annual cash bonuses in respect of the period between January 1, 2023, and the
Closing Date shall be paid to employees of the Company within three (3) Business Days following the Closing in amounts calculated based
on the level of performance attained as of immediately prior to the Closing, as determined by the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) in accordance with applicable performance and other customary criteria consistent with past practice, and prorated to
reflect the portion of the 2023 performance period elapsed as of the Closing Date and (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay Continuing Employees an annual bonus in respect of the 2023 fiscal year equal to the excess of (x) the annual
A-43Table of Contents
bonus payable under the applicable Company bonus plan for 2023 as in effect as of the Closing Date calculated based on actual
performance for the entire 2023 fiscal year over (y) the bonus paid to such Continuing Employee pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5.8(c).
If the Closing occurs in 2024 but prior to the date on which annual cash bonuses in respect of 2023 are determined and paid, such bonus
payments in respect of 2023, if any, shall be calculated on the basis of actual performance for the 2023 performance period under the terms
of the applicable Company bonus plan as shall be determined by the Parent Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) in good faith
using a methodology reasonably consistent with the past practices of the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee of non-employee
directors thereof). In addition, if the Closing does not occur prior to March 1, 2024, then, notwithstanding anything in Section 5.1 to the
contrary, the Company shall, following prior consultation with Parent, be permitted to adopt performance goals with respect to an annual
cash bonus program for the Company’s 2024 fiscal year in the ordinary course of business, and in such case Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor such bonus program for Continuing Employees in accordance with its terms (subject to commercially
reasonable adjustments after the Closing Date as required for integration purposes). Except as otherwise provided in an applicable
employment agreement or in an applicable severance plan adopted by the Company, in each case, prior to the date of this Agreement or in
accordance with this Section 5.8, in order to be eligible to receive any bonus payment pursuant to this Section 5.8(c), a Continuing
Employee must be employed by either the Company or a member of the Parent Group on the date the bonus is paid (or, with respect to any
bonus period in 2023 ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the Closing Date), and if not so employed on such date, any bonus payment
otherwise due to such individual shall be forfeited.

Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a
“change in control” or “change of control” (or other similar phrase) for purposes of each Company Benefit Plan. From and after the Closing,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) be bound by, honor and comply with the terms of each employment, severance
and change in control plan, policy and agreement and other Company Benefit Plan listed in Section 5.8(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) take such actions as set forth on Section 5.8(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
(e)
From and after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates to, be bound by, and to comply with the terms of, the Company
CBAs as in effect as of the Closing Date until Parent or its affiliates negotiate a new collective agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 5.8, Parent further agrees that the provisions of this Section 5.8 shall be subject to any applicable provisions of the
Company CBA in respect of Continuing Employees, to the extent such provisions are inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the
provisions of any such Company CBA as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Furthermore, Parent agrees to honor all applicable
seniority integration or similar rights contained in any Company CBA in accordance with the terms thereof.

Nothing in this Agreement will require the continued employment of any Person and no provision of this Agreement will prevent Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or benefit plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
of any Parent or its Subsidiaries. The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Agreement with
respect to Service Providers are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties signatory hereto and will not create any right in any
other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, nor will require the Company to continue or amend any particular benefit plan
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any Service Provider, and any such plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. This Agreement is not intended to amend any Company Benefit Plan.

From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company agrees that any material written or formal oral
communications to employees of the Company regarding the terms and conditions of their employment (including compensation and
benefits) following the Merger will

(a)
For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company to the same extent such
Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws and indemnification agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement with any directors, officers and employees of the
Company arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation will, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceedings with respect to the matters subject to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 5.9(a) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Bylaws and indemnification agreements in
existence on the date of this Agreement.
(b)
For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification of directors and officers of the
Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws. The
Surviving Corporation will cause the indemnification agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors,
officers or employees of the Company to continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

the Company’s existing policies (accurate and complete copies which have been previously provided to Parent) for claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time or (ii) maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, if available, the
current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (the “D&O Insurance”); provided, that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company’s existing policy with respect to matters occurring prior to the

excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which annual premium is set forth on Section 5.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule). The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence will be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate
period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(d)
In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any

Time, the Company shall deliver all Additional Prepayment Amounts to each holder of Company RSU Awards pursuant to, and in
accordance with, Section 2.4(a), and to each holder of Company Performance Share Awards pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section
2.4(b).
(e)
Subject to the terms of this Section 5.18(e), Parent shall indemnify the Company Group for any and all Income Tax Losses arising from any
final “determination” within the meaning of section 1313(a) of the Code (or a similar determination under applicable state or local income or
other applicable Tax rules), or a settlement reached in accordance with the procedures required by this Section 5.18(e) of a claim, (x) that any
member of the Company Group is required to recognize the Approval Prepayment and/or the Additional Prepayments, if any, as income or
gain for income Tax purposes in any Tax period or to report such amounts to their recipients for Tax purposes or (y) that the Company
Termination Fee is a Non-Deductible Payment (such determination or settlement, an “Adverse Income Tax Determination”, and such Income
Tax Losses, “Indemnified Company Tax Losses”). Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to any Indemnified Company Tax Loss
within ten (10) Business Days after written demand by the Company therefor accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation or
statements setting forth a description of such Indemnified Company Tax Loss and a calculation of the amount so payable; provided,
however, that if Parent does not agree with such calculation or any aspect of the
A-50
Table of Contents
Company’s statements or analysis purporting to establish the magnitude of the Indemnified Company Tax Loss, (A) Parent and the
Company shall cooperate reasonably and in good faith to agree upon the amount of such Indemnified Company Tax Loss, if any, (B) if
Parent and the Company are unable to resolve any disagreements within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt by Parent of such written
demand, the dispute shall be submitted to an Independent Accountant for resolution within thirty (30) Business Days after its engagement
by Parent and the Company, (C) Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the Indemnified Company Tax Loss as determined by
the Independent Accountant within five (5) Business Days after the Independent Accountant’s determination and (D) the costs and
expenses of the Independent Accountant and of any enforcement of the determination thereof shall be borne by Parent and the Company in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accountant. In the event that the Company Group
utilizes any net operating loss carryovers or other tax attributes (collectively, “Tax Attributes”) to reduce or offset any Income Tax Losses
that would otherwise have been indemnifiable by Parent under this paragraph, then (i) the amount of Tax Attributes so utilized shall be set
forth on, and the tax items against which the Tax Attributes were applied shall be described in detail in, the supporting documentation or
statements provided by the Company, (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of Income Tax Losses indemnifiable by Parent under this
paragraph shall be determined after taking such reductions and offsets into account and (iii) Parent shall promptly pay to the Company, as
and when such Tax Benefit would have been realized by the Company Group, an amount equal to any Tax Benefit that the Company Group
would have realized with respect to such Tax Attributes for any subsequent taxable period had such Tax Attributes not been so utilized,
such hypothetical realization of Tax Benefits to be determined not based upon any assumptions regarding whether such Tax Benefits will or
may be realized in the future, but rather on a “with and without” basis, taking into account such Tax Attribute(s) as the last item(s) claimed
for any taxable year, including after the utilization of any available net operating loss carryforwards (such payments in respect of Tax
Benefits, “Tax Benefit Payments”). Until the obligations of Parent contained in this Section 5.18(e) expire, Parent shall, at its expense, be
entitled to control all Proceedings which relate to a potential Indemnified Company Tax Loss or potential Adverse Income Tax Determination
to the extent that such Proceedings can be separated from other Tax issues concerning the Company Group without adverse consequences;
provided that (i) the Company shall, at its expense, be entitled to participate in any such Proceeding to the extent allowed by applicable Law,
(ii) Parent shall not enter into any settlement of any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and (iii) if any Proceeding shall be conducted in a manner requiring the payment of
any Taxes that may be Indemnified Company Tax Losses to a Governmental Entity, Parent shall advance to the Company (on an interest-free
basis) the amount of such payment. With respect to any Proceeding relating to a potential Indemnified Company Tax Loss (including a
Proceeding relating to a potential Adverse Income Tax Determination) not described in the preceding sentence, the Company shall control
such Proceeding; provided that (A) Parent shall bear the reasonable and documented costs and expenses of such Proceeding to the extent
such costs and expenses would not have been incurred but for the Company’s defense of claims or issues that may give rise to Indemnified
Company Tax Losses, (B) Parent shall, at its expense, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding to the extent allowed by applicable Law,
(C) no member of the Company Group shall (1) settle any issues raised in such Proceeding, to the extent such issues may give rise to an
Indemnified Company Tax Loss, or (2) petition a court or file suit in court with respect to a Proceeding relating to a potential Indemnified
Company Tax Loss or Adverse Income Tax Determination, without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and (D) if such Proceeding shall be conducted, with the consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), in a manner requiring the payment of any Taxes that may be Indemnified
Company Tax Losses to a Governmental Entity, Parent shall advance to the Company (on an interest-free basis) the amount of such
payment. In addition to the other obligations set forth in this Section 5.18(e), the Company shall, and to the extent reasonably practicable
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent and, in a
A-51
Table of Contents
reasonably timely manner, provide Parent with material information that Parent reasonably requests in connection with any potential
Indemnified Company Tax Loss or any Proceeding relating to a potential Adverse Income Tax Determination or any other matter relating to
this Section 5.18(e). Parent and the Company further agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep each other reasonably informed of
proposed material meetings with any Governmental Entity in connection with any matter relating to this Section 5.18(e) and to allow the
other party to attend such meetings, to the extent legally permitted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligations of Parent contained in this Section 5.18(e) shall survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (such date, the “Release Date”); provided that if the Company notifies Parent in writing of any claim hereunder prior to the
Release Date, the obligations of Parent contained in this Section 5.18(e) shall survive until the final resolution of such claim (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of Parent to make Tax Benefit Payments to the Company). Parent may offset amounts owed by the
Company to Parent under this Agreement (including any unpaid portion of the Company Termination Fee), if any, against Indemnified
Company Tax Losses to reduce the amount payable by Parent to the Company Group under this Section 5.18(e).
(f)
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to agree upon consistent U.S. federal income tax reporting in respect of the Approval
Prepayment, the Additional Prepayments and the transactions described in this Section 5.18; provided that, unless otherwise required
pursuant to a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, the Parties shall report the amounts paid by Parent or its
designated agent to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 5.18(a) and Section 5.18(c) as amounts paid by Parent or its
designee directly to, and for the benefit of, the stockholders of the Company for U.S. federal income tax and all other applicable tax
purposes.
(g)
To the extent that Parent designates a bank or trust company to act as the disbursing agent for purposes of effecting the payments to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to this Section 5.18 (the “Disbursing Agent”), the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts
to deliver to Parent and the Disbursing Agent such information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the
Disbursing Agent to permit Parent to make the payments to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to this Section 5.18 and (ii)
cooperate in good faith with Parent and the Disbursing Agent in connection with the payments to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.18. Parent shall be responsible for all costs and expenses of the Disbursing Agent.

In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (solely to the extent the Order giving rise to such termination right
