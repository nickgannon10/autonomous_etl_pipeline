Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Natus,
with Natus continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (the
“Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value

Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury, held by Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective subsidiaries or as to which appraisal rights have been perfected in accordance with the DGCL, but
including each share of Company Restricted Stock (as defined below)) will be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $33.50, without interest thereon and less
any applicable withholding taxes (the “Per Share Price”). After the Merger is completed, you will no longer own any
shares of the capital stock or any other rights or interest in the Surviving Corporation and you will have the right to

of a certificate or certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s
message” by the payment agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the payment agent would reasonably

of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted

achieved at maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied;

the Merger Agreement (such awards, “Employee Interim Awards”), that are outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted
pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be treated at the Effective Time in the manner set forth

above, provided that any applicable performance goals will be deemed achieved at target levels (rather
than at maximum) and the number of shares subject to such Employee Interim Awards that will vest at
the Effective Time will be prorated to reflect the portion of the applicable vesting period that has
elapsed from the date of grant until the Effective Time (rather than vesting in full), and the remaining
unvested portion of any Employee Interim Awards will be forfeited at the Effective Time;
•
each option (or portion thereof) to purchase a share of Company Common Stock (a “Company
Option”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested
and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, and that has an exercise price per
share less than the Per Share Price (each, an “In-the-Money Company Option”) will be cancelled and
converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to
any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per
share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock that are issuable upon the full exercise of such Company Option; and

CEO Retention Agreement
To ensure the continued retention of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas J. Sullivan,
following the Closing, in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Parent required Mr. Sullivan to enter
into a retention agreement, dated as of April 17, 2022, with Parent and the Company (the “CEO Retention
Agreement”).
Pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that, notwithstanding the treatment of Company
Restricted Stock Units set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described above), he would not receive payment in
respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units that are market stock units (“MSUs”) based on deemed achievement
of performance goals at maximum levels. Instead, Mr. Sullivan’s MSUs will be deemed attained at the level of
performance actually achieved through the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately 143.4% of
target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs
granted to Mr. Sullivan in January 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company’s stockholders pursuant
to the Merger Agreement. The consequence to Mr. Sullivan will be a reduction by over $3,000,000 in the amount of
gross proceeds that he otherwise was entitled to receive and would have received in respect of his MSUs.
Furthermore, pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the
“Retention Payment”) payable to him at the Effective Time in respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units would
not become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, would become payable 50% on the six-month anniversary of
the Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his continued employment with the
Company until the relevant retention date. If Mr. Sullivan’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause,
by Mr. Sullivan with good reason, or due to his death or disability, any then-unpaid portion of the Retention Payment
will be paid to him upon his termination (subject to, in the case of a termination by the Company without cause or by
Mr. Sullivan for good reason, his execution and non-revocation of a release of claims). If Mr. Sullivan’s employment
terminates for any other reason prior to the relevant retention date, he will immediately forfeit all portions of the
Retention Payment that relate to a future retention date. Mr. Sullivan’s right to receive the Retention Payment is
further subject to his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants. At the Effective Time, all other
amounts payable to Mr. Sullivan in respect of his Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units will
become payable in accordance with the Merger Agreement, as described above.
The CEO Retention Agreement was signed at the same time the Merger Agreement was signed, but if the Merger
Agreement is terminated and the Closing does not occur, it will automatically become null and void.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S.
Holder’s shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an
amount measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger
and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company Common Stock surrendered in the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of
Company Common Stock for cash in the Merger, unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United
States.
Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating
to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-
income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax jurisdiction.

The completion of the Merger is conditioned on, among other things, any applicable waiting period (and any
extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”)
and certain other antitrust and foreign investment laws having expired or been terminated, or all requisite consents
pursuant thereto being obtained.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and Natus, on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts (x) to take (or cause to be taken)
all actions; (y) do (or cause to be done) all things; and (z) assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing (or
causing to be done) all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable law (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger, including by using its reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the Merger in the
Merger Agreement to be satisfied.
On April 29, 2022 and May 5, 2022, Natus and Parent, respectively, filed notification of the proposed Merger with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) under the HSR Act. The waiting period under the HSR Act is expected to expire at
11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 6, 2022.

If the Merger is consummated, Company Stockholders who do not vote their shares of Company Common Stock in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold such shares of Company Common Stock
from the date they make the demand through the Effective Time, and who properly perfect appraisal of their shares of
Company Common Stock will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the
DGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are met. This means that such stockholders would
be entitled to have their shares of Company Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to
receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
4TABLE OF CONTENTS
voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL).
Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company
Common Stock are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Company Common
Stock as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of
the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares of Company Common Stock. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned

After considering various factors more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-
Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” the Board of Directors of Natus (the
“Board of Directors” or “Board”) has unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and
the Company Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the
Merger in accordance with the DGCL upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms
and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (3) resolved to recommend, subject to certain provisions in
the Merger Agreement, that the Company Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time,
if necessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or
may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Company Stockholders, the Board of Directors may withdraw or change its recommendation regarding the Merger
Agreement and the Merger, provided that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law, as further described and subject to compliance with
the obligations described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Other Covenants
Under the Merger Agreement-Acquisition Proposals; Change in the Recommendation of Natus’ Board of Directors.”

solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement and that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such competing acquisition proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) ,

recommendation regarding the Merger Agreement and the Merger, or (ii) terminate the Merger Agreement to
concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, provided that in either case the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take

financial advisory services and to provide the Board of Directors an opinion in connection with the possible sale of
Natus. Natus selected Stifel as its financial advisor based on the fact that Stifel is a reputable investment banking firm
with substantial experience advising companies in the healthcare and medical technology sectors and in providing
strategic advisory services in general. On April 17, 2022, Stifel delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in
writing by delivery of a written opinion dated April 17, 2022 (the “Opinion”), to the Board of Directors as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view and as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various limitations,

transactions or strategies that might be available to Natus or the underlying business decision of Natus to proceed

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or
in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) adopting
the Merger Agreement; and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company Stockholders,
the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among
other matters. These interests include the following:
•
accelerated vesting and cash out of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted
Stock Units at the Effective Time, with any performance conditions applicable to outstanding Company
Restricted Stock Units (including those held by our executive officers) deemed to have been achieved at
the maximum levels and with the remaining time vesting requirements deemed satisfied (except that,
pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, a portion of Mr. Sullivan’s Company Restricted Stock Units are
deemed achieved at the actual level of achievement based on the Per Share Price and a portion of the
proceeds otherwise payable at the Effective Time in respect of Mr. Sullivan’s Company Restricted Stock
Units will not become payable to him at the Effective Time and, instead, will be subject to vesting based on
his continued service following the Effective Time);
•
in the case of our currently employed executive officers (other than Dr. Chung), the opportunity to receive
payments and benefits under each executive officer’s respective employment agreement upon either (1) an
involuntary termination of service other than for “cause,” death, or disability or (2) voluntary resignation
for “good reason,” in each case, occurring, in the case of Mr. Sullivan, within the 3-month period preceding
or 24-month period following the Effective Time or, in the case of Messrs. Davies and Noll, within the 6-
month period following the Effective Time. These payments and benefits may include:
7TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
cash severance equal to, in the case of Mr. Sullivan, two times the sum of his annual base salary and
target annual bonus, and in the case of each of Messrs. Davies and Noll, the sum of his annual base
salary and target annual bonus;
•
solely in the case of Mr. Sullivan, a prorated target annual bonus for the year of termination, with the
prorated amount based on the number of days that he was employed during the year prior to
termination of service; and
•
payment of the premium costs for continuing health benefits for a period of time following termination;
•
in the case of our executive officers and directors who have an account balance pursuant to our
nonqualified deferred compensation plan, we intend to terminate our nonqualified deferred compensation
plan prior to the Effective Time, resulting in the cessation of deferrals under the plan and accelerated
payment of each such balance (which is fully vested regardless of the Merger), promptly following the

From and after the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by DGCL or pursuant to any and all provisions of any certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
similar organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries and any indemnification agreements with Natus
and any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of April 17, 2022, each current or former director and officer of Natus
(and any person who becomes a director or officer of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time)
(“Indemnified Person”) from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent that such legal proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or
indirectly, with respect to any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to the extent
that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Merger).
During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the
Subsidiaries of Natus, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger Agreement that have been made available to Parent.
During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
except as required by applicable law.
The Merger Agreement also provides during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, “D&O
Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect
to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are substantially equivalent to those of the D&O
Insurance; provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer (of the same
or better credit worthiness and financial capability) of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured thereunder. The Surviving Corporation will not be obligated
to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the annual premium amount paid by Natus for coverage for its last full
fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums
8TABLE OF CONTENTS
of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated
to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, Natus may (and if Natus is unable to purchase such a policy prior to Closing,
Parent shall) purchase a prepaid six-year “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the
aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If Natus (or Parent) purchases
such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder
for so long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time.

acquisition proposal, provided that such competing acquisition proposal was not solicited in material breach the
foregoing non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement and (i) the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such competing acquisition
proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such actions would reasonably be

was not previously made available to Parent. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned

Natus, Parent and Merger Sub agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties do not perform the provisions of the Merger
Agreement (including any party failing to take such actions as are required of it thereunder in order to consummate
the Merger Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Natus, on the other hand, will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that Natus will have the right to an injunction or specific
performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger if and only if (1) all conditions to each party’s obligations to effect the Merger and conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing (provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)) at the time when the Closing
was required to have occurred pursuant the Merger Agreement, (2) the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing)
has been funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded to fund the Merger at the Closing, and (3)
Natus has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
is funded and Parent and Merger Sub comply with their obligations in the Merger Agreement, then Natus is ready,
willing and able to, and will take such actions as are within its control, to consummate the Closing pursuant the
Merger Agreement. However, Natus may not be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in
the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance and all or any portion of a termination fee paid by Parent).

may attend the Company Stockholder Meeting solely via a live interactive webcast on the Internet at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NTUS2022SM. We refer to the special meeting, and any adjournment,
postponement or other delay of the Company Stockholder Meeting, as the “Company Stockholder Meeting.” You will
need the control number found on your proxy card or voting instruction form in order to participate in the Company
Stockholder Meeting (including voting your shares). We elected to use a virtual meeting due to the ongoing public
health impact of the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) and to support the health and well-being of our directors,
employees and stockholders, as well as our positive experiences with virtual meetings.
Record Date; Shares of Company Common Stock Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting if you owned shares of Company
Common Stock at the close of business on May 31, 2022 (the “record date”). You will have one vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting for each share of Company Common Stock that you owned and are entitled to vote at the close
of business on the record date. If you own shares that are registered in the name of someone else, such as a broker,
you need to direct that person to vote those shares or obtain an authorization (i.e. obtain a legal proxy) from them
and vote the shares yourself at the meeting.
Only stockholders of record are entitled to participate in, vote at and examine the stockholders list during the
Company Stockholder Meeting. All stockholders with a 16-digit control number have the ability to vote, participate in
Q&A and view the stockholders list. Beneficial stockholders who did not receive a 16-digit control number from their
bank or brokerage firm who wish to attend the meeting should follow the instructions from their bank or brokerage
firm, including any requirement to obtain a legal proxy. Most brokerage firms or banks allow a stockholder to obtain a
legal proxy either online or by mail.
Purpose
At the Company Stockholder Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the Merger
Agreement; (2) adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) to approve, by non-
binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.
13TABLE OF CONTENTS
Quorum
As of the record date, there were 34,582,882 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at
the Company Stockholder Meeting. The stockholders of Natus representing a majority of the issued and outstanding
Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting, present in person (virtually) or
represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for purposes of transacting business at the Company Stockholder
Meeting.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Company capital
stock entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. An abstention, a failure to vote your
shares of Company Common Stock or a broker non-vote (if any) will all have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the Merger Agreement proposal.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, regardless of whether a quorum is present at
the Company Stockholder Meeting, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or
negatively at the Company Stockholder Meeting. An abstention, a failure to vote your shares of Company Common
Stock or a broker non-vote (if any) will each have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.
Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Natus’
executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
affirmatively or negatively at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Assuming a quorum is present, an abstention, a
failure to vote your shares of Company Common Stock or a broker non-vote (if any) will each have no effect on the
outcome of this proposal.
Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, 423,604 shares of Company Common Stock, representing approximately 1.2% of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding on the record date. All of our directors and executive officers have informed us that they
intend to vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2)
“FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Voting and Proxies
Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting may submit a proxy by returning a
signed proxy card by mail in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone, or may vote in person (virtually) by appearing at the Company Stockholder Meeting. If you
are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of Company Common Stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or
other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of
Company Common Stock using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. Under applicable
stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals
expected to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers and
other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you cast
your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.
If you are a stockholder of record on the record date, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time
before it is voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting by (1) signing another proxy card with a later date and
returning it to us prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting; (2) submitting a new proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3) delivering a written notice of revocation to
our corporate secretary; or (4) attending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting in person (virtually) by ballot.
If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person (virtually) at the Company
Stockholder Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Company Stockholder Meeting will be
voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly executed
proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted (1) “FOR” the proposal regarding adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if
necessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and
(3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become
payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Shares of Company Common Stock represented at the Company Stockholder Meeting but not voted, including
shares of Company Common Stock for which proxies have been received but for which stockholders have abstained,
will be treated as present at the Company Stockholder Meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence
of a quorum for the transaction of all business.
Only shares affirmatively voted for the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement, including properly
executed proxies that do not contain specific voting instructions, will be counted “FOR” that proposal. If you attend
the Company Stockholder Meeting in person (virtually) or by proxy but abstain from voting, it will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on
the other proposals. If you do not execute a proxy card and do not attend the Company Stockholder Meeting in
person (virtually), it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger
Agreement, but will not have any effect on the other proposals (assuming, in the case of the proposal to approve, by
non-binding advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger, that a quorum is present).

file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, Natus will be required to pay to Parent a
termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement.

The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger
Agreement and the Company Stockholder Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that
are important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this
proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents we refer to in this proxy statement. You may
obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions

Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
The Board of Directors is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock of Natus in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the Company
Stockholder Meeting.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Company Stockholder Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
1)
To adopt the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Natus and
Natus will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the “Merger”);
2)
To approve the adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if necessary or
appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting; and
3)
To approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by
Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting?
A:
Holders of Company Common Stock as of May 31, 2022 (the “record date”) are entitled to notice of the Company
Stockholder Meeting and to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before the Company Stockholder
Meeting for each share of Company Common Stock owned as of the record date.
Q:
Why are you having a virtual Company Stockholder Meeting?
A:
We elected to use a virtual meeting due to the ongoing public health impact of the coronavirus outbreak
(COVID-19) and to support the health and well-being of our directors, employees and stockholders, as well as
our positive experiences with virtual meetings.
Q:
How can I attend a virtual Company Stockholder Meeting?
A:
The Company Stockholder Meeting will be held on July 6, 2022, at 10:00 A.M., Eastern Time via live webcast on
the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NTUS2022SM. Only stockholders of record of shares of our
Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the record date, may participate in the Company
Stockholder Meeting, including voting and asking questions during the virtual meeting. You will not be able to
attend the Company Stockholder Meeting physically in person.
Only stockholders of record are entitled to participate in, vote at and examine the stockholders list during the
Company Stockholder Meeting. All stockholders with a 16-digit control number have the ability to vote,
participate in Q&A and view the stockholders list. Beneficial stockholders who did not receive a 16-digit control
number from their bank or brokerage firm who wish to attend the meeting should follow the instructions from
their bank or brokerage firm, including any requirement to obtain a legal proxy. Most brokerage firms or banks
allow a stockholder to obtain a legal proxy either online or by mail.
Even if you plan to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting virtually, to ensure that your shares will be
represented and voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting we encourage you to sign, date and return the
16TABLE OF CONTENTS
enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone. If you attend the Company Stockholder Meeting and vote virtually by ballot, your vote
will revoke any proxy previously submitted by you with respect to the shares so voted at the Company
Stockholder Meeting.
If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other
nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your
shares at the Company Stockholder Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee and submit it to the Company in the manner described above.
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Natus?
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Natus by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is
adopted by stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Natus with Natus continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a
result of the Merger, Natus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Company Common Stock will
no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, Company Common Stock will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A:
Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price for each share of Company
Common Stock that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of Company Common Stock, you will receive
$3,350.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of Company Common Stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Q:
How does the Per Share Price compare to the unaffected market price of the Company Common Stock?
A:
The relationship of the Per Share Price to the trading price of the Company Common Stock constituted a
premium of approximately 28.6% to the closing price of $26.05 on April 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we
refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return,
as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Company Stockholder
Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy
card.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send
your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by your stock certificates, as described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Exchange of Certificates and Payment Procedures.” You should
use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled.
Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions
from your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name.”
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Company Common Stock after the record date but
before the Company Stockholder Meeting?
A:
The record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting is earlier than the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company Common Stock after the record date but before the Company Stockholder Meeting, unless special
arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or
otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Natus in writing of such special arrangements, you will
transfer the right to receive the Per Share Price, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or
transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Company Stockholder Meeting.
Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Company Common Stock after the record date, we
encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant
your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone.
Q:
How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
A:
The Board of Directors, after considering the various factors described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger-Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has
unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of Natus and Company Stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Natus, the
performance by Natus of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger
upon the terms and conditions set forth therein; and (3) resolved to recommend that Company Stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to
time, if necessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Company Common Stock. Instead, Natus will
remain an independent public company, Company Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on
NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.
Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Effect on Natus if the Merger is Not
Completed.”
Under specified circumstances, Natus will be required to pay Parent a termination fee upon the termination of
the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-
Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees.”
Q:
What constitutes a quorum?
A:
The stockholders of Natus representing a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock
entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting, present in person (virtually) or represented by proxy, will
constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at such meeting. As of the record date, 17,291,442
shares of Company Common Stock will be required to obtain a quorum. Abstentions and any broker non-votes
(if any) are considered as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
Q:
What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
A:
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
capital stock entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or
by telephone; or (3) vote virtually by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name”, the
failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time,
if necessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting?
A:
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the Company Stockholder Meeting, regardless of
whether a quorum is present.
The failure of any stockholder of record to: (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or
by telephone; or (3) vote virtually by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting will not have any effect on the
adjournment proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal. Abstentions will not
have any effect on the adjournment proposal.
Q:
What vote is required to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become
payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the Company Stockholder Meeting.
The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or
by telephone; or (3) vote virtually by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting will not, assuming a quorum is
present, have any effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, of certain compensation
that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares will not, assuming a quorum is present, have any effect on the compensation proposal. Abstentions will
not, assuming a quorum is present, have any effect on the compensation proposal.
Q:
Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding certain compensation that will or may
become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
SEC rules require Natus to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding certain compensation that will or may
become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger for purposes of this advisory vote?
A:
The compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with
the Merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of Natus’
named executive officers. For further detail, please see the section in this proxy statement captioned “Proposal
3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote to Approve Certain Merger Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”
Q:
What will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger at the Company Stockholder Meeting?
A:
Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the
compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Natus or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is adopted by
the stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger may be paid to Natus’ named executive officers even
if stockholders do not adopt the payment of that compensation. The underlying plans and arrangements
providing for such compensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder
approval.
Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. For further detail, please
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.,
you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record” as of the record date. In this
case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Natus.
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee as of the record date, you are considered the
“beneficial owner” of shares of Company Common Stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy
statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to
those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank,
broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited
to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may
not vote your shares in person (virtually) at the Company Stockholder Meeting unless you obtain a “legal
proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes
with shares I hold of record?
A:
No. For voting purposes, any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different
stockholder than any shares you hold of record, and as a result, any shares held in “street name” will not be
combined for voting purposes with shares that you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various
registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will
receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for the shares held in each such form, because
they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of Company Common Stock held by a corporation
or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Company Common Stock are registered in your name
with Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•
by signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
•
by visiting the internet at the address on your proxy card;
•
by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
•
by attending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting virtually by ballot.
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your
shares of Company Common Stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded
when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge
for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as
internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
Even if you plan to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting in person (virtually), you are strongly encouraged
to vote your shares of Company Common Stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal
proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Company Common Stock
virtually by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are
present at the Company Stockholder Meeting and vote virtually by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not
be counted.
If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the
internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee,
you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.
Q:
If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me without receiving voting
instructions from me?
A:
No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
scheduled to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote
your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same
effect as if you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, or, assuming a quorum is present, the
proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by
Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
A:
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting by:
•
signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us in accordance with the instructions
therein prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting;
•
submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier
submitted proxy but prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting;
•
delivering a written notice of revocation to the corporate secretary; or
•
attending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting virtually by ballot.
If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or
other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote virtually at the Company
Stockholder Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Company
Common Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Company
Stockholder Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares
of Company Common Stock is called a “proxy card.” Thomas J. Sullivan is the proxy holder for the Company
Stockholder Meeting.
Q:
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you
indicate. When completing the internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your
shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of
business to come before the Company Stockholder Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) “FOR” the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if
necessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will
or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone) each proxy
card and voting instruction card that you receive.
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one
brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you
hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
receive more than one proxy card.
21
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Company Stockholder Meeting?
A:
Natus will publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the
Company Stockholder Meeting. All reports that Natus files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. Please
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to
the Merger?
A:
If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to the
Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S.
Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the shares of Company Common Stock surrendered in the Merger.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the
exchange of Company Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain
connections to the United States.
Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor to determine the
U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and
any consequences arising under U.S. Federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax
jurisdiction. A more complete description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is
provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger.”
Q:
What will the holders of Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Options
receive in the Merger?
A:
At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with respect to Employee Interim Awards, each share of
Company Restricted Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be cancelled and converted into
and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax
withholding, equal to the Per Share Price.
At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with respect to Employee Interim Awards or as set forth in the
CEO Retention Agreement, each Company Restricted Stock Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan,
will be cancelled and be converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest
and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) (1)
with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are only subject to time-vesting requirements, the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit, and (2) with
respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are subject to time- and performance-vesting requirements, the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock determined to be performance vested with the performance
goals deemed achieved at maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied.
At the Effective Time, any Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units that are Employee
Interim Awards and are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested
and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be treated at the Effective Time in the
manner set forth above, provided that any applicable performance goals will be deemed achieved at target levels
(rather than at maximum) and the number of shares subject to such Employee Interim Awards that will vest at the
Effective Time will be prorated to reflect the portion of the applicable vesting period that has elapsed from the
date of grant until the Effective Time (rather than vesting in full), and the remaining unvested portion of any
Employee Interim Awards will be forfeited at the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, and is an
22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per
Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by (ii) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon the full exercise of such Company Option.
At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.
Pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that he will not receive payment in respect of his
Company Restricted Stock Units that are MSUs based on deemed achievement of performance goals at
maximum levels and, instead Mr. Sullivan’s MSUs will be deemed attained at the level of performance actually
achieved through the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately 143.4% of target, in the case
of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr.
Sullivan in January 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. The consequence to Mr. Sullivan will be a reduction by over $3,000,000 in the amount of
gross proceeds that he otherwise was entitled to receive and would have received in respect of his MSUs.
Furthermore, pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that an amount equal to $6,000,000
(the “Retention Payment”) payable to him at the Effective Time in respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units
would not become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, would become payable 50% on the six-month
anniversary of the Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his continued
employment with the Company until the relevant retention date. If Mr. Sullivan’s employment is terminated by
the Company without cause, by Mr. Sullivan with good reason, or due to his death or disability, any then-unpaid
portion of the Retention Payment shall be paid to him upon his termination (subject to, in the case of a
termination by the Company without cause or by Mr. Sullivan for good reason, his execution and non-
revocation of a release of claims). If Mr. Sullivan’s employment terminates for any other reason prior to the
relevant retention date, he will immediately forfeit all portions of the Retention Payment that relate to a future
retention date. Mr. Sullivan’s right to receive the Retention Payment is further subject to his continued
compliance with certain restrictive covenants.
Q:
What will happen to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
A:
There are no outstanding purchase rights under the Company’s 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Even if the
Company’s Amended and Restated 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) is adopted by the Company’s
stockholders at its 2022 annual meeting, the Merger Agreement does not permit any employee to commence
participation in the ESPP and requires that the ESPP be terminated as of the Effective Time.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A:
We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the
Merger in the third calendar quarter of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be
predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger,” many of which are outside of our
control.
Q:
If the Merger is completed, how will I receive the cash for my shares?
A:
If the Merger is completed and your shares of Company Common Stock are held as uncertificated shares, the
payment agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action
on your part. If you are a stockholder of record with your shares held in certificated form, you will receive a letter
of transmittal with instructions on how to send your shares of Company Common Stock to the payment agent in
connection with the Merger. The payment agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your
shares after you comply with these instructions. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy

who continuously hold shares from the date they demand appraisal through the Effective Time, and who
properly demand appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock will be entitled, provided certain
conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are met, to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger
under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled
to have their shares of Company Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive
payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the
DGCL). Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock are encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this
proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to
this proxy statement.
Q:
Do any of Natus’ directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Company
Stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and
negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) adopting the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending
that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered
these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, please see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger.”

Only stockholders of record as of May 31, 2022 (the “record date”) are entitled to notice of the Company Stockholder
Meeting and to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices, located at 3150 Pleasant View Road,
Middleton, WI 53562, during regular business hours beginning for a period of no less than 10 days before the
Company Stockholder Meeting and will be made available on the meeting website during the Company Stockholder

As of the record date, there were 34,582,882 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at
the Company Stockholder Meeting.
The stockholders of Natus representing a majority of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock entitled to
vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting, present in person (virtually) or represented by proxy, will constitute a
quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Company Stockholder

Each share of Company Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one
vote on each of the proposals to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
Capital stock entitled to vote thereon as of the close of business on the record date is required to adopt the Merger
Agreement. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders is a condition to the Closing of the Merger.
Regardless of whether a quorum is present, either the chairman of the meeting or the stockholders by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively, will have the power to adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company
currently expects that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively at the Company Stockholder meeting is
required to approve the non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to
Natus’ executive officers in connection with the Merger.
28TABLE OF CONTENTS
If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have the no effect on the other proposals
(assuming, in the case of the proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to Natus’
executive officers in connection with the Merger, that a quorum is present).
Each “broker non-vote” (if any) will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
but will have no effect on the other proposals. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs with respect to a specific
proposal when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares of Company Common Stock on your behalf is entitled
to vote on at least one proposal at a meeting, so that such shares are present at the meeting, but does not vote on the
proposal at issue because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks
discretionary power to vote the shares of Company Common Stock on such proposal. Under applicable stock
exchange rules, brokers, banks or other nominees have the discretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you
fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. The
proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and brokers, banks and other nominees therefore cannot
vote on the proposals without your instructions such that it is anticipated that there will be no broker non-votes at
the meeting.",37,38

intend to vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2)

Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone by following the instructions on

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies
received in time for the Company Stockholder Meeting will be voted at the Company Stockholder Meeting in
accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting
instructions will be voted (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger

binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.
With respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting, the proxy
holders will vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment. If you fail to return your proxy card (and fail to
grant a proxy by telephone or the Internet) and you are a holder of record on the record date, unless you attend the
Company Stockholder Meeting and vote virtually, the effect will be that your shares of Company Common Stock will
not be considered for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Company

will not have any effect on the other proposals (assuming, in the case of the proposal to approve certain
compensation that will or may become payable to Natus’ executive officers in connection with the Merger, that a
quorum is present).
If your shares of Company Common Stock are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you
may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your

“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet
or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting form provided
by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do
not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the
Company Stockholder Meeting and vote virtually with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will
have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will not have any

submitted proxy and before the Company Stockholder Meeting;

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Company Stockholder Meeting, in the absence of voting in
person (virtually) or submitting an additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior
proxy.
If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other
nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person (virtually) at the Company
Stockholder Meeting by delivering a legal proxy pursuant to your bank, broker or other nominee's requirements.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who
continuously hold such shares from the date they demand appraisal through the Effective Time and who properly
perfect appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock will be entitled, provided certain conditions set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL are met, to appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be
entitled to have their shares of Company Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive
payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL),
so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, Natus stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock are
encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Company
Common Stock as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than
the value of the Per Share Price that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek
appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Natus before the vote is taken
on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) not vote, in person (virtually) or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement; and (3) continue to hold the subject shares of Company Common Stock of record
through the time (the “Effective Time”) Parent, Merger Sub and Natus cause the Merger to be consummated pursuant
to the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your
appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Natus
stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
appraisal exceeds 1% of Natus’ outstanding shares of Company Common Stock eligible for appraisal or (y) the value
of the aggregate Per Share Price in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. The DGCL requirements for exercising
appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding
appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as

Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock through a bank, brokerage firm

other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank,
brokerage firm or nominee.

We are asking you to adopt the Merger Agreement.
For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement
and the Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The
Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex A. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.
Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of Company capital stock entitled to vote thereon. If you abstain from voting
or fail to cast your vote, in person (virtually) or by proxy, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement.

We are asking you to approve a proposal for one or more adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting from
time to time, if necessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting. If the stockholders of Natus approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting, and any adjourned session of the Company Stockholder Meeting, and use the
additional time, among other things, to solicit additional proxies.
If, at the Company Stockholder Meeting, the number of shares of Company Common Stock present in person
(virtually) or by proxy and voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not sufficient to approve
that proposal, we may move to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to enable our directors, officers
and employees to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In that event, we will ask the
stockholders of Natus to vote only upon the adjournment proposal, and not the Merger Agreement proposal.
We retain full authority to the extent set forth in our bylaws and the DGCL (subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement) to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting for any other purpose without the consent of any
stockholders of Natus.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

CERTAIN MERGER RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an
advisory, non-binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Natus’ named
executive officers by Natus in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger-Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute
Compensation.”
We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation payments that will or may become
payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger-Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the various plans and
arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously formed part of Natus’
overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders
as part of the compensation discussion and analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements (other than
the acceleration of vesting of equity-based awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement). These historical
arrangements were approved and adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which believed
them to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms. The CEO Retention Agreement, which was entered into
with Mr. Sullivan by the Company and Parent in connection with the Merger, has the consequence of reducing the
amounts that would otherwise be payable to Mr. Sullivan pursuant to the Merger Agreement and causing him to
receive less favorable treatment of his equity-based awards as compared to the treatment of equity-based awards
held by other employees of the Company.
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Company Stockholder Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Natus Medical Incorporated approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the
compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger-Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Golden Parachute
Compensation.”
Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote,
the result will not be binding on Natus, the Board of Directors or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and
arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, our named executive officers will be
eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms
and conditions applicable to those payments.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

This discussion of the merger (the “Merger”) of Prince Mergerco Inc. (“Merger Sub”) with and into Natus Medical
Incorporated (“Natus”) is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, made and
entered into as of April 17, 2022 (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Natus,
Prince Parent Inc. (“Parent”), and Merger Sub, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should read the entire Merger Agreement carefully as it is
the legal document that governs the Merger.
Effect of the Merger",45,45
NATUS MEDICAL INC_20220602_DEFM14A_20144466_4472051.Pdf,Effect of the Merger,"Effect of the Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger
Sub will be merged with and into Natus and Natus will continue as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, Company Common Stock will no longer be publicly
traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. At this time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Natus, and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation; and all debts, liabilities and duties of Natus and
Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. In addition, all outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic
reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock or any other rights
or interest in the Surviving Corporation.
The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later time as would be specified in the Certificate of Merger.
Effect on Natus if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
Company Stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares (or interests in shares) of Company Common
Stock. Instead, Natus will remain an independent public company, Company Common Stock will continue to be listed
and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the
SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the business in a manner
similar to that in which it is being operated today and that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks
and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in
which Natus operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, we cannot assure you as to the effect of these risks and opportunities
on the future value of your shares of Company Common Stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors
of Natus (the “Board of Directors”) will continue to evaluate and review Natus’ business operations, strategic
direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If the
Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can
be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board of Directors will be offered or that Natus’
business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.
In addition, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Natus will be required to pay
Parent a termination fee. If the termination fee becomes payable by Natus due to (x) Natus’ termination of the Merger
Agreement on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 22, 2022 (the “Cut-Off Date”) with respect to Natus
entering into an alternative acquisition agreement with an Excluded Party (as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement), the amount of the termination fee will be $19,753,676, and (y) if the termination fee becomes payable
under any other circumstance, the amount of the termination fee will be $39,507,352. For more information please see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement;
Termination Fees.”
If the Merger Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company (A) if all of the closing conditions have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) and the Company is prepared to
consummate the Merger but Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger in accordance with the Merger
Agreement or (B) in connection with Parent or Merger Sub breaching or failing to perform in any material respect its
representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to not be
satisfied (subject to a cure period in certain circumstances), or (ii) if either party terminates because the Merger has
not been consummated by the Outside Date (as defined in the section of this proxy
36TABLE OF CONTENTS
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees”), and at the
time of such termination, the Company was otherwise entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for either of the
foregoing reasons, then, in each case, Parent will be obligated to pay to the Company a one-time fee equal to
$79,014,704 in cash. For more information please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees.”
The Per Share Price",45,46

At the Effective Time, and without any action required by any stockholder, each share of Company Common Stock
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting
Company Shares (each as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement), but including each share of Company
Restricted Stock) will be cancelled and extinguished, and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to $33.50 without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes.
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Price, but you will no longer have any
rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights may have the right to
receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares of Company Common Stock as determined pursuant to an
appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described below under the caption “The Merger
Agreement-Appraisal Rights”).

NATUS MEDICAL INC_20220602_DEFM14A_20144466_4472051.Pdf,Background of the Merger,"Background of the Merger
The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.
This chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Board of Directors, Natus’
representatives or other parties.
As part of the ongoing consideration and evaluation of Natus’ long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of
Directors and Natus’ senior management periodically review, consider and assess Natus’ operations and financial
performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. This review
includes, among other items, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions
and other financial and strategic alternatives.
In early January 2021, a private equity sponsor (“Financial Sponsor A”) submitted a proposal to acquire the
Company for a per share price of $28 to $30 in cash. In mid-January 2021, the Board of Directors met and discussed
and considered this proposal, and also in attendance were members of management and outside counsel. Outside
counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. In light of that conversation,
the Board of Directors determined to retain a financial advisor. Shortly after that meeting, the Board of Directors met
again to interview two financial advisors, one of whom was Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (“Stifel”). After
evaluating both financial advisors, and discussing each financial advisor’s qualifications, credentials and
independence in connection with serving as the Company’s financial adviser, the Board of Directors retained Stifel to
be the Company’s financial advisor, based on Stifel’s expertise and experience in similar transactions and absence of
conflicts. At a subsequent meeting, the Board of Directors met again, with representatives of Stifel and outside
counsel in attendance. Outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware
law. Based on instruction by the Board of Directors, Stifel encouraged Financial Sponsor A to improve the terms of its
proposal before due diligence access would be granted by the Company.
In early February 2021, Financial Sponsor A subsequently increased its proposal for a business combination with the
Company to a per share price of $35 to $37 in cash. Outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their
fiduciary duties under Delaware law. The Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of
management and outside counsel. The Board of Directors discussed and considered this improved proposal, and in
mid-February 2021, at the direction of the Board of Directors, the Company and Financial Sponsor A entered into a
confidentiality agreement (which contained a “standstill” provision that, among other things, would automatically
terminate if the Company were to enter into a definitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or
consolidated assets), and the Company provided due diligence access to Financial Sponsor A.
37TABLE OF CONTENTS
In early March 2021, while Financial Sponsor A was continuing its due diligence on the Company, outside counsel to
Financial Sponsor A provided a draft merger agreement to the Company and its outside counsel. Thereafter, during
March 2021, outside counsel for Financial Sponsor A and outside counsel for the Company discussed and
negotiated the terms of the merger agreement.
In late March 2021, Financial Sponsor A informed Stifel that it no longer was willing to pay a price per share of $35 to
$37 in cash. Shortly thereafter, the Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of management and
representatives from Stifel and outside counsel. After outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their
fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors discussed this development, and determined to contact
other potential financial and strategic parties who might have interest in the Company. The Board of Directors noted
that contacting other parties had the risk of creating opportunities for public speculation that the Company was
pursuing a sale, and that such speculation could be harmful to the Company and its employees and business
partners. In light of these considerations, the Board of Directors determined that the risks of broadly contacting too
many additional potential acquirers outweighed the benefits, and instead determined to instruct Stifel to contact a
more tailored set of other potential parties. In late March 2021, pursuant to instructions from the Board of Directors,
Stifel contacted two strategic parties and one financial sponsor, who the Board of Directors, in consultation with
Stifel, believed would have synergies in connection with an acquisition of the Company. The two strategic parties
declined to enter into confidentiality agreements. The one financial sponsor did sign a confidentiality agreement with
the Company (which contained a “standstill” provision that, among other things, would automatically terminate if the
Company were to enter into a definitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets)
and conducted limited due diligence but declined to proceed further.
At the end of March 2021, Financial Sponsor A communicated to Stifel that they would be willing to proceed at a
price per share of $31. Shortly thereafter, the Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of
management and representatives from Stifel and outside counsel. Outside counsel reviewed with the Board of
Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, after which the Board of Directors discussed this development
and reviewed this revised proposal from Financial Sponsor A. The Board of Directors declined to make a definitive
decision on the revised proposal by Financial Sponsor A at that time. The Board of Directors determined to contact
additional other potential financial and strategic parties who might have interest in the Company. The Board of
Directors again discussed and weighed the benefits of a targeted approach versus a broad approach to contacting
other parties noted above. In light of these considerations, the Board of Directors again determined that the risks of
broadly contacting too many additional potential acquirers outweighed the benefits, and instead determined to
instruct Stifel to contact a more tailored set of other potential parties.
In early April 2021, pursuant to instructions from the Board of Directors, Stifel contacted an additional strategic party
and three financial sponsors. The strategic party declined to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Company,
but each of the three financial sponsors entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company (each of which
contained a “standstill” provision that, among other things, would automatically terminate if the Company were to
enter into a definitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets). Two of the three
financial sponsors proceeded with due diligence but declined to proceed further. The third declined to proceed with
due diligence.
The Board of Directors met again in early to mid-April 2021, and also in attendance were members of management and
representatives from Stifel and outside counsel. After outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their
fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors further discussed the revised proposal of $31 per share in
cash from Financial Sponsor A. The Board of Directors authorized Thomas Sullivan, then the senior independent
director, to speak with Financial Sponsor A to encourage it to improve its proposal. In mid to late April 2021, Mr.
Sullivan spoke with a representative at Financial Sponsor A, and Financial Sponsor A thereafter signaled a
willingness to improve its proposal, offering to acquire the Company for a per share price of $31.50 in cash. However,
in early May 2021, Financial Sponsor A notified the Company that it was no longer willing to proceed with a
transaction with the Company.
In mid-2021, the Company and ArchiMed SAS (“ArchiMed”) had discussions concerning the Company’s interest in
acquiring a portfolio company of ArchiMed (the “Portfolio Company”). These discussions were preliminary and high
level. The Company received information on the Portfolio Company and conducted preliminary due diligence, but the
Company did not provide any information of the Company to ArchiMed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In August 2021, the Company’s management met with a strategic party (“Strategic Party A”) as part of the normal
course of business. During this meeting, Strategic Party A expressed interest in pursuing a strategic transaction with
the Company. In mid-August 2021, the Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of management
and representatives from Stifel and outside counsel. After outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their
fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors discussed this interest from Strategic Party A, and
authorized management to cause the Company to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Strategic Party A. The
Board of Directors also determined to contact other financial sponsors and strategic parties to assess their interest in
a business combination transaction with the Company. The Board of Directors again discussed and weighed the
benefits of a targeted approach versus a broad approach to contacting other parties noted above. In light of these
considerations, the Board of Directors again determined that the risks of broadly contacting too many additional
potential acquirers outweighed the benefits, and instead determined to instruct Stifel to contact a more tailored set of
other potential parties.
In late August 2021, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Strategic Party A (which contained a
“standstill” provision that, among other things, would automatically terminate if the Company were to enter into a
definitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets). Subsequent to entering into
the confidentiality agreement, the Company’s management met with Strategic Party A’s management to provide due
diligence information.
In September 2021, Stifel, at the instruction of the Board of Directors, contacted two additional financial sponsors and
one strategic party to assess their interest in a business combination transaction with the Company. Each of these
parties signed a confidentiality agreement with the Company (which contained a “standstill” provision that, among
other things, would automatically terminate if the Company were to enter into a definitive agreement to sell more than
50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets). All three parties were then given access to due diligence information.
The two financial sponsors declined to proceed further. The strategic party indicated interest in certain segments of
the Company but not the entire Company, but such a transaction would not, in the view of the Board of Directors,
have been viewed favorably by the Company Stockholders. The strategic party did not indicate a definitive price it
would be willing to pay for the segments in which it was interested.
During the month of September 2021, Strategic Party A continued its due diligence investigation of the Company. In
late September 2021, Strategic Party A submitted a proposal to acquire the Company for $28 per share in cash.
In early October 2021, the Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of management and
representatives from Stifel and outside counsel. After outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their
fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors discussed the proposal from Strategic Party A. The Board
of Directors authorized the chairman of the Board of Directors and the senior independent director, and Stifel, to
encourage Strategic Party A to improve the terms of its proposal. The Board of Directors also discussed that
Strategic Party A may make a request of exclusivity, and that such a request would be acceptable if Strategic Party A
improved its proposal. In early October 2021, after the chairman of the Board of Directors, the senior independent
director and Stifel met with Strategic Party A, Strategic Party A submitted an improved proposal, which it stated was
its best and final offer, to acquire the Company for $32 per share in cash, conditioned upon a short period of
exclusivity. Thereafter, the Company and Strategic Party A signed an exclusivity agreement providing for a short
period of exclusivity. The Company’s outside counsel then sent a draft merger agreement to Strategic Party A’s
outside counsel, and the parties negotiated that merger agreement, and Strategic Party A continued its due diligence,
during the remainder of October 2021 and early November 2021. In early November 2021, Strategic Party A declined to
proceed with the transaction.
On December 17, 2021, the Company announced the transition of its chief executive officer from Jonathan Kennedy
to Thomas J. Sullivan, as further described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with
the SEC on December 17, 2021.
On December 21, 2021, Mr. Denis Ribon from ArchiMed SAS contacted Mr. Sullivan to see if Mr. Sullivan would be
interested in meeting.
39
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 5, 2022, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Ribon, along with two colleagues, met by video conference to discuss their
two companies. Only public information was discussed at this meeting. The parties agreed to a face to face meeting
on January 19, 2022. Mr. Sullivan informed the Chairman of the Board of Directors of this planned meeting on January
7, 2022.
On January 18, ArchiMed sent a presentation, which contained solely public information, about ArchiMed to Mr.
Sullivan.
On January 19, 2022, Mr. Sullivan met with representatives of ArchiMed to discuss their companies. Mr. Sullivan only
disclosed publicly available financial information about the Company at this meeting. Two days later, on January 21,
2022, Mr. Sullivan held a video call with representatives of ArchiMed to discuss the Company’s interest in the
Portfolio Company. Again, Mr. Sullivan only disclosed publicly available financial information about the Company at
this meeting.
On January 25, 2022, ArchiMed’s representative, Mr. Bateman, and Mr. Sullivan discussed the Company’s interest in
the Portfolio Company. An additional meeting was held on January 28, 2022 for the same purpose.
On February 1, 2022 Mr. Sullivan informed the Board of Directors of meetings he had had with external parties in the
normal course of the Board meeting. Mr. Sullivan noted that he suspected ArchiMed had an interest in acquiring the
Company.
On February 4, 2022, Mr. Bateman informed Mr. Sullivan that ArchiMed was considering submitting a proposal for a
business combination with the Company. Mr. Sullivan said he would promptly bring any offer to the Board of
Directors. On February 7, 2022, Mr. Sullivan informed the Chairman of the Board of Directors that ArchiMed may be
submitting a proposal for a business combination with the Company.
On February 9, 2022, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Bateman discussed the Company’s interests in the Portfolio Company.
On February 16, 2022, ArchiMed submitted a written proposal to Mr. Sullivan to acquire the Company for $32 per
share in cash (the “Initial ArchiMed Proposal”). Mr. Sullivan promptly forwarded the proposal to the Board of
Directors.
The Board of Directors met on February 20, 2022, to discuss the Initial ArchiMed Proposal, and also in attendance
was outside counsel. Outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law.
The Board of Directors reviewed the financials for the five year strategic plan presented by management. The Board
of Directors determined to direct Stifel to engage with ArchiMed and to encourage ArchiMed to improve the terms of
the Initial ArchiMed Proposal. The Board of Directors also authorized the Company to enter into a confidentiality
agreement with ArchiMed, if management determined such action would be helpful in encouraging ArchiMed to
improve the terms of its proposal.
On February 21, 2022, representatives of Stifel spoke with representatives of ArchiMed. Stifel encouraged ArchiMed
to improve the terms of the Initial ArchiMed Proposal.
On February 23, 2022, Jefferies LLC, financial advisor to ArchiMed (“Jefferies”), contacted Stifel. Jefferies
communicated that ArchiMed may be willing to increase the per share price in the Initial ArchiMed Proposal but
would require access to due diligence information as a first step.
On February 25, 2022, the Company and ArchiMed entered into a confidentiality agreement (which contained a
“standstill” provision that, among other things, would automatically terminate if the Company were to enter into a
definitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets).
During March 2021, ArchiMed conducted its due diligence of the Company.
On March 17, 2022, the Board of Directors met, with representatives from Stifel in attendance. The Board of Directors
confirmed that the Management Projections were authorized and directed to be used by Stifel for the purposes of
Stifel’s financial analysis of fairness of the consideration proposed to be paid in the proposed transaction. The
representatives from Stifel then reviewed the Initial ArchiMed Proposal from a financial point of view based on
information provided by the Company’s management, including the Management Projections, and publicly available
information. Representatives from Stifel also briefed the Board of Directors on ArchiMed’s progress to date on due
diligence matters. The representatives from Stifel briefed the Board of Directors on the absence of any material
relationships between Stifel and ArchiMed.
40
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On March 28, 2022, ArchiMed submitted a revised written proposal to acquire the Company for $33 per share in cash
(the “1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal”).
On March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting. Also in attendance were members of management,
representatives from Stifel and a representative from Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, the Company’s outside counsel
(“Davis Polk”). The representative of Davis Polk reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under
Delaware law. The Board of Directors discussed the 1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal. The representatives from Stifel
reviewed the 1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal from a financial point of view based on information provided by the
Company’s management, including the Management Projections, and publicly available information. The Board of
Directors then temporarily adjourned the meeting. Later that day, the Board of Directors resumed the meeting with
only the directors in attendance. The Board of Directors determined to instruct Stifel to encourage ArchiMed to
improve the terms of the 1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal. The Board of Directors also determined to instruct Davis
Polk to prepare a form of Merger Agreement with terms that are consistent with the terms of the merger agreement
that had been negotiated with Financial Sponsor A in March 2021 that could be used for a transaction between the
Company and ArchiMed.
On March 31, 2022, Stifel provided to Jefferies the form of Merger Agreement prepared by Davis Polk for a proposed
transaction between the Company and ArchiMed, but also communicated to Jefferies that in order for the Company
to be willing to continue discussions with ArchiMed and to continue to provide due diligence information to
ArchiMed, that ArchiMed would need to improve its 1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal.
On April 1, 2022, Jefferies, on behalf of ArchiMed, delivered to Stifel a further revised proposal to acquire the
Company for $33.50 per share in cash (the “2nd Revised ArchiMed Proposal”). Jefferies communicated, on behalf of
ArchiMed, that this was ArchiMed’s best and final offer, and would be conditioned upon ArchiMed receiving
exclusivity through 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on April 13, 2022.
On April 2, 2022, the Board of Directors met. Also in attendance were members of management, representatives from
Stifel and representatives from Davis Polk. Representatives from Stifel reviewed with the Board of Directors the 2nd
Revised ArchiMed Proposal from a financial point of view, and informed the Board of Directors that the 2nd Revised
ArchiMed Proposal was ArchiMed’s best and final offer. The Board of Directors noted that ArchiMed had twice
raised its price per share, and that there was a significant risk that were the Board of Directors to delay the process by
seeking a further increase in the price per share, that ArchiMed would discontinue discussions. The representative
from Davis Polk reviewed with the Board of Directors the terms of the Merger Agreement that had been provided to
ArchiMed and noted for the Board of Directors that, consistent with the Board of Directors’ instruction, the terms of
the Merger Agreement were substantially similar to the merger agreement that had been negotiated with Financial
Sponsor A in March 2021, including the presence of a “go shop” provision that would permit the Company to
actively solicit more favorable offers. The Board of Directors also discussed the ArchiMed request for exclusivity
until 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on April 13, 2022, noting that it was a short period of time encompassing 11 days of
exclusivity and, in light of the absence of other interested parties and the presence of the “go-shop period” in the
Merger Agreement, was not likely to discourage other, more favorable offers. Representatives from Stifel and Davis
Polk also reviewed with the Board of Directors the structure of the “go-shop” provision. After discussion, the Board
of Directors authorized and directed management, Stifel and Davis Polk to proceed with discussions and negotiations
with ArchiMed and its advisors, including on the Merger Agreement and the exclusivity letter.
Also on April 2, 2022, Stifel contacted Jefferies and communicated that the Company was willing to continue
discussions. Later during that same day, ArchiMed’s counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham”) sent a draft
exclusivity letter to Davis Polk which provided for exclusivity through 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on April 13, 2022, which
Latham and Davis Polk negotiated. The exclusivity agreement was signed by the Company and ArchiMed on April 2,
2022.
On April 3, 2022, ArchiMed and Latham began conducting confirmatory due diligence on the Company. This
confirmatory due diligence also included video conferences with members of Company management and continued
review of information in a virtual dataroom. On April 4, 2022, Davis Polk sent a draft of the Company disclosure letter
to Latham.
On April 7, 2022, Latham sent a markup of the proposed Merger Agreement to Davis Polk. On April 8, 2022, Davis
Polk reviewed the markup with members of management, and then held a conference call with Latham to negotiate the
terms of the Merger Agreement, including, among other provisions, the “go shop” and
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
no solicitation clauses, the break-up fee and reverse break-up fee, the termination provisions, the interim operating
covenants and other covenants, and the representations and warranties. Davis Polk sent a revised draft of the
Merger Agreement to Latham during the evening of April 8, 2022.
On April 10, 2022, Latham sent a markup of the revised Merger Agreement and a markup of the Company disclosure
letter to Davis Polk.
On April 11, 2022, Latham sent drafts of the equity commitment letter, the debt commitment letter and the limited
guaranty to Davis Polk.
Also on April 11, 2022, Davis Polk reviewed the markups with members of management, and then held a conference
call with Latham to negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company disclosure letter and the other
transaction agreements. Davis Polk sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and the Company disclosure letter
to Latham during the evening of April 11, 2022.
On April 12, 2022, Mr. Bateman spoke with Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Bateman stated that, in order for ArchiMed to be willing
to enter into the transaction with the Company, ArchiMed would require that Mr. Sullivan sign a retention letter (the
“Retention Letter”) pursuant to which, among other things, Mr. Sullivan would agree to receive less favorable
treatment of his equity awards as compared to other employees of the Company. Mr. Sullivan said he would consider
this request and updated the chairman of the Board of Directors of such request.
Also on April 12, 2022, during discussions between Mr. Bateman and Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Bateman expressed
ArchiMed’s concern over the treatment of outstanding MSUs proposed by Natus in the Merger Agreement, namely,
that all MSUs would be treated as if all performance hurdles had been fully satisfied, which in the view of ArchiMed
would increase costs associated with the transaction while diminishing the post-closing retention incentives in place
for key managers. After further discussions, Mr. Sullivan communicated to Mr. Bateman that, if necessary for
ArchiMed to proceed with the proposed transaction, Mr. Sullivan would be willing to agree to less favorable
treatment of his outstanding MSUs as compared to all other MSU holders (resulting in Mr. Sullivan receiving
$3,000,000 less than he would otherwise receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement), and Mr. Sullivan would
agree that $6,000,000 of proceeds in respect of his outstanding equity-based awards that he would otherwise be
entitled to receive at closing would instead be held back and paid to Mr. Sullivan as compensation for his services for
certain periods after closing. Mr. Sullivan’s rationale for being willing to agree to these concessions was: (i) his
concern that ArchiMed would be otherwise unwilling to proceed with the proposed transaction (and that would
deprive the Company Stockholders of the choice as to whether or not to vote to accept a transaction that would
provide a substantial premium); (ii) in the unlikely event that ArchiMed were otherwise willing to proceed, Mr.
Sullivan believed that (a) ArchiMed would decrease the price per share payable to the Company Stockholders to an
amount less than $33.50 per share and (b) ArchiMed would require that all of the Company’s employees forego
acceleration of all or a portion of their equity awards, which would make employees less likely to remain at the
Company pending closing and potentially jeopardize the operation of the Company’s business; and (iii) Mr.
Sullivan’s MSUs would be paid out at the level of performance actually achieved through the closing based on the
per share price of $33.50, consistent with the level of return to the Company’s stockholders.
On April 13, 2022, Latham sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Company disclosure letter to Davis
Polk.
Later that evening on April 13, 2022, the Board of Directors met. Also in attendance were members of management,
representatives of Stifel and representatives of Davis Polk. Copies of the Merger Agreement and other transaction
agreements and a financial presentation by Stifel and a legal presentation by Davis Polk, had been provided to the
Board of Directors in advance of the meeting. A representative of Davis Polk reviewed with the Board of Directors
their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the material terms of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction
agreements, as well as the outstanding issues. A representative from Stifel reviewed their preliminary financial
analyses with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $33.50 per share in cash price that
ArchiMed was proposing. Mr. Sullivan noted for the Board of Directors that there were still outstanding issues to be
resolved, including the amount of the break-up fee and reverse break-up fee, the events that would trigger payment
of those fees, the no solicitation clause and on the regulatory undertaking covenant. The Board of Directors
instructed management, Stifel and Davis Polk to continue to work toward resolving the remaining outstanding issues
in a manner as favorably as possible to the Company Stockholders.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
At 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on April 13, 2022, the exclusivity period expired. In light of a potential transaction with
ArchiMed being close to signing, the Board of Directors noted that contacting other parties at this time had the risk
of creating opportunities for public speculation that the Company was pursuing a sale, and that such speculation
could be harmful to the Company and its employees and business partners, and could cause the loss of the potential
transaction with ArchiMed. In light of these considerations, the Board of Directors determined that the risks of
contacting additional potential acquirers outweighed the benefits.
On April 14, 2022, Davis Polk spoke with Latham to negotiate the outstanding issues in the Merger Agreement and
the other transaction agreements, including, among others, as to the break-up fee, the reverse break-up fee, the
circumstances under which each was payable, and the regulatory undertaking covenant. Later on April 14, 2022,
Davis Polk sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction agreements to Latham.
On April 15, 2022, Mr. Sullivan spoke with Mr. Bateman regarding the outstanding issues. Later that day, Latham sent
revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and other transaction agreements to Davis Polk. Davis Polk and Latham
negotiated the outstanding issues. Davis Polk sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction
agreements to Latham late in the evening on April 15, 2022.
On April 16, 2022, Mr. Sullivan spoke again with Mr. Bateman regarding the remaining outstanding issues. Thereafter,
Davis Polk and Latham finalized the Merger Agreement and the other transaction agreements.
On the morning of April 17, 2022, the Board of Directors met. Also in attendance were members of management,
representatives of Stifel and representatives of Davis Polk. Copies of the Merger Agreement and other transaction
agreements and a financial presentation by Stifel and a legal presentation by Davis Polk, had been provided to the
Board of Directors in advance of the meeting. A representative of Davis Polk reviewed with the Board of Directors
their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, as well as the material terms of the Merger Agreement and the other
transaction agreements. The representative of Davis Polk also reviewed with the Board of Directors the resolution of
the outstanding issues. A representative from Stifel reviewed Stifel’s financial analysis of the $33.50 per share in cash
merger consideration and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 17, 2022, to
the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters considered, the
procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken,
the $33.50 per share in cash merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of the Company’s
common stock. Stifel also reviewed again with the Board of Directors its relationships with ArchiMed (as more fully
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Opinion of Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated”).
The Board of Directors, after considering the reasons and factors more fully described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “-Recommendation of the Board of Directors and the Reasons for the Merger,” (1) determined
that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (3) resolved
to recommend that the Company Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. Subsequently, the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors met and adopted resolutions providing for the treatment of equity awards in the
Merger Agreement, and certain other matters.
The Company and entities formed by ArchiMed subsequently signed the Merger Agreement and the other
transaction agreements.
Early on April 18, 2022, before the opening of trading on the NASDAQ, the Company publicly disclosed the
proposed transaction.
During the Go-Shop Period, at the direction and under the supervision of the Board of Directors, representatives of
Stifel contacted parties that, in the view of the Board of Directors, based on advice from Stifel, might be capable of,
and might be interested in, pursuing an acquisition of the Company on terms that could reasonably be expected to be
more favorable to the Company and its stockholders. During the go-shop period, and at the direction of the Board of
Directors, representatives of Stifel contacted a total of 31 parties (collectively, the “Go Shop Parties”), including 12
strategic parties (including Strategic Party A) and 19 financial sponsors (including Financial Sponsor A), to solicit
their interest in a possible acquisition of the Company.
43
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Of the Go Shop Parties contacted by representatives of Stifel, 3 parties executed confidentiality agreements and were
granted access to certain non-public information regarding the Company. Certain of the parties that executed
confidentiality agreements asked diligence questions of, and received answers from, the Company and engaged in
additional discussion with representatives of Stifel. None of the Go Shop Parties contacted, nor any other party, has
submitted an alternative acquisition proposal to the Company as of the date of this proxy statement that the Board of
Directors believes could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.",46,53

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the
Company Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger
in accordance with the DGCL upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (2)
approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions
set forth therein; and (3) resolved to recommend, subject to certain provisions in the Merger Agreement, that the
Company Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL;
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
(2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate,
as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
the Board of Directors consulted with management, its financial advisor and outside legal counsel. In recommending
that stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors considered a variety
of factors, including without limitation the following principal factors (not in any relative order of importance):
•
historical information regarding (i) Natus’ business, financial performance and results of operations, (ii)
market prices, volatility and trading activity with respect to the Company Common Stock, and (iii) market
prices with respect to other industry participants and general market indices;
•
current information regarding (i) Natus’ business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology,
products, services, management, competitive position and strategic business goals and objectives, (ii)
general economic, industry and financial market conditions, (iii) geopolitical conditions (including, without
limitation, tariffs, COVID-19, supply chain disruptions, the shortage of semiconductors and the war in
Ukraine) which are affecting Natus’ business, and (iv) opportunities and competitive factors within Natus’
industry;
•
ongoing efforts and uncertainty relating to COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine;
•
the historically high multiples of public companies in the equity markets generally;
•
the fact that the all-cash Per Share Price would provide certainty of value and liquidity to stockholders,
while eliminating the effect of long-term business and execution risk to stockholders;
•
Natus’ business, current and projected financial performance and condition and future prospects in relation
to the Per Share Price of $33.50;
•
the fact that the Per Share Price represented an attractive premium of approximately 28.6% from the closing
stock price per share of Company Common Stock of $26.05 on April 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to
the execution of the Merger Agreement, and approximately 23.1% from the closing stock price per share of
Company Common Stock of $27.22 on March 3, 2022, which is 30 trading days prior to the execution of the
Merger Agreement;
44TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the timing of the Merger and the risk that if Natus did not accept the ArchiMed offer (as provided for in the
Merger Agreement), it may not have another opportunity to do so or to accept a comparable opportunity;
•
the Board of Directors’ belief that the Merger was more favorable to the Company Stockholders compared
to the alternative of remaining a standalone independent company, which belief was based on and informed
by consideration of a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, including without limitation:
•
the competitive landscape and the dynamics of the market for Natus’ products, and the assessment
that other alternatives were not reasonably likely to create greater value for stockholders than the
Merger, taking into account execution risk as well as business, competitive, industry and market risk;
and
•
the perceived risk of continuing as an independent public company or pursuing other alternatives,
including (1) the continuation of Natus’ business plan as an independent enterprise; (2) potential
modifications to Natus’ strategy; (3) potential divestitures of Natus’ business lines, which could
possibly result in a more focused company; and (4) potential expansion opportunities into new
business lines through acquisitions and combinations of Natus with other businesses;
•
the Board of Directors’ view that the Merger Agreement was the product of arm’s-length negotiation and
contained customary terms and conditions;
•
the Board of Directors’ belief, based on discussions and negotiations with Parent, that the Per Share Price
was the highest price the Parent would be willing to pay and the highest price reasonably obtainable, each
as of the date of the Merger Agreement;
•
the review of Natus’ strategic and financial alternatives, including:
•
the fact that during the approximately 14-month period leading up to the execution of the Merger
Agreement, the Board of Directors explored and evaluated various potential strategic alternatives,
including a sale of the whole company, including to Financial Sponsor A and to Strategic Party A,
each of which had submitted a final acquisition proposal with a price per share that was lower than the
Per Share Price;
•
the fact that the various other strategic parties and financial sponsors that were contacted by Stifel
over a 14-month period did not submit any proposal for a business combination with Natus; and
•
the Board of Directors’ belief that it was unlikely that another party would be willing or able to pay
more than the Per Share Price in cash;
•
Natus’ ability during the Go-Shop Period to actively solicit alternative proposals, and Natus’ ability, under
certain other circumstances after the Go-Shop Period, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations
with an Excluded Party regarding alternative acquisition proposals, and that a reduced break-up fee would
be payable by Natus were it to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal during the
Go-Shop Period;
•
the Board of Directors’ “fiduciary out” with respect to third-party acquisition proposals made after the Go-
Shop Period which would reasonably be expected to result in Superior Proposals, the Board of Directors’
ability to negotiate with another party regarding a Superior Proposal and, subject to paying a termination
fee to Parent, accept a Superior Proposal;
•
the Board of Directors’ view that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter interested
third parties from making a Superior Proposal, including the Merger Agreement’s terms and conditions as
they relate to changes in the recommendation of the Board of Directors and terminating the Merger
Agreement, and the belief that the termination fee potentially payable to Parent is reasonable in light of the
circumstances, and not preclusive of other offers (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement-Other Covenants Under the Merger Agreement-Acquisition Proposals; Change in the
Recommendation of Natus’ Board of Directors”);

fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the Per Share Price to be

Dissenting Company Shares), as more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement

the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the approval by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote;

the fact that the financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment
Letter, together with Natus’ cash on hand, were sufficient to fund the aggregate purchase price and
the other payments contemplated by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Merger
Agreement, and that Natus is a named third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter;
•
the absence of a financing condition to the closing of the Merger, and Parent’s representations and
warranties relating to the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter and the Limited
Guaranty;
•
Natus’ ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal, subject to
Parent’s right to match such Superior Proposal and subject to paying Parent (x) a termination fee of
$19.7 million (representing approximately 1.65% of the equity value of the transaction), with respect to
Natus entering into an alternative acquisition agreement with an Excluded Party prior to the Cut-Off
Date or (y) a termination fee of $39.5 million (representing approximately 3.3% of the equity value of
the transaction) if payable otherwise;
•
Natus’ entitlement to a reverse termination fee from Parent of $79.0 million (representing approximately
6.6% of the equity value of the transaction) if (i) the Merger Agreement is terminated by Natus (A) if
all of the closing conditions have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing) and Natus is prepared to consummate the Merger but Parent and Merger
Sub fail to consummate the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement or (B) in connection
with Parent or Merger Sub breaching or failing to perform in any material respect its representations,
warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to not be
satisfied (subject to a cure period in certain circumstances), or (ii) if either party terminates the Merger
Agreement because the Merger has not been consummated by the Outside Date, and at the time of
such termination, Natus was otherwise entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for either of the
foregoing reasons;

guarantees the payment of the termination fee that may become payable by Parent under the Merger
Agreement;

stockholders;

the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware law to the Company Stockholders who do not vote
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required procedures
under Delaware law for perfection of such appraisal rights, which rights provide eligible stockholders
with an opportunity to have the Delaware Court of Chancery determine the fair value of their shares of
Company Common Stock, which may be more than, less than or the same as the amount such
stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement, and

•
the Board of Directors’ multiple reviews and discussions with Natus management and its financial and
legal advisors;
•
the fact that Natus engaged in negotiations primarily with Parent regarding a potential transaction rather
than conducting a broad “auction” or sale process for Natus, as well as that Natus previously engaged in
extensive discussions with Financial Sponsor A and Strategic Party A;
•
the fact that the announcement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to complete the Merger, could
cause substantial harm to Natus’ relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to
attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key management, technical, sales and other
personnel), vendors, customers and commercial partners and may divert management and employees’
attention away from Natus’ day-to-day business operations;
•
the fact that stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of Natus and will not benefit
from any appreciation in value of Natus, including any appreciation in value that could be realized as a
result of improvements to our operations or future strategic or other transactions by Natus;
•
the requirement that Natus pay Parent (x) a termination fee of $19.8 million, with respect to Natus entering
into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal prior to the Cut-Off Date or (y)
a termination fee of $39.5 million in certain other circumstances, including if the Board of Directors
terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal after the Cut-Off Date;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Natus’ business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the
requirement that Natus conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which
may delay or prevent Natus from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion
of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, Natus might have pursued;
•
the fact that an all cash transaction will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes;
•
the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Natus is unable to solicit other acquisition
proposals after the Go-Shop Period End Date during the pendency of the Merger;
•
the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the
Merger and the substantial time and effort of management required to complete the Merger, which may
disrupt Natus’ business operations;
•
the fact that if the Merger is not consummated, Natus will be required to pay its own expenses associated
with the Merger Agreement;
•
the fact that Natus’ business, sales operations and financial results could suffer in the event that the
Merger is not consummated;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of
termination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of the Company Common Stock;
•
the fact that the completion of the Merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and certain
other countries; and
•
the fact that Natus’ directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, those of the other Company Stockholders (see below in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “-Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”).
After considering the foregoing potentially negative and potentially positive factors, the Board of Directors
concluded that the potentially positive factors relating to the Merger Agreement and the Merger substantially
outweighed the potentially negative factors.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not meant to be
exhaustive, but is intended to reflect the material factors considered by the Board of Directors in its consideration of
the Merger. In view of the large number of and variety of factors considered by the Board of Directors and the
complexity of these factors, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and

judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to different factors. The Board of Directors

NATUS MEDICAL INC_20220602_DEFM14A_20144466_4472051.Pdf,"Opinion of Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated","Opinion of Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated
In connection with the Merger, Natus retained Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (“Stifel”) to provide it with
financial advisory services and to provide the Board of Directors an opinion in connection with the possible sale of
Natus. As part of that engagement, on April 17, 2022, Stifel delivered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion dated April 17, 2022 (the “Opinion”), that, as of
that date and based upon and subject to the various limitations, matters, qualifications and assumptions set forth
therein, the Per Share Price to be received by holders of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) (collectively, the “Excluded
Shares”) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair to such holders, from a financial point of view.
Natus did not impose any limitations on Stifel with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed in
rendering the Opinion. In selecting Stifel, the Board of Directors considered, among other things, the fact that Stifel is
a reputable investment banking firm with substantial experience advising companies in the healthcare and medical
technology sectors and in providing strategic advisory services in general. Stifel, as part of its investment banking
business, is regularly engaged in the independent valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers,
acquisitions, underwritings, sales, and distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business, Stifel and its clients may
transact in the equity securities of Natus and Parent or its affiliates and may at any time hold a long or short position
in such securities.
The full text of the Opinion that Stifel delivered to the Board of Directors is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex B and is incorporated into this document by reference. The summary of the Opinion set forth in this proxy
statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Opinion. Company Stockholders are urged to
read the Opinion carefully and in its entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limits of the review undertaken by Stifel in connection with the Opinion.
The Opinion was for the information of, and directed to, the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) for its
information and assistance in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the Merger. The Opinion did
not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to how the Board of Directors should vote or otherwise
act on the Merger or any other matter or to any stockholder of Natus as to how any such stockholder should act with
respect to the Merger or any other matter, including, without limitation, how to vote at any stockholders’ meeting at
which the Merger is considered, or whether or not to enter into a voting, stockholders’, or affiliates’ agreement with
respect to the Merger, or exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be available to such stockholder. In
addition, the Opinion did not compare the relative merits of the Merger with any other alternative transactions or
business strategies that may have been available to Natus and did not address the underlying business decision of
the Board of Directors or Natus to proceed with or effect the Merger.
In connection with the Opinion, Stifel, among other things:
•
discussed the Merger and related matters with Natus’ management and counsel and reviewed the financial
terms of the Merger contained in a draft dated April 16, 2022, of the Merger Agreement (the “Draft Merger
Agreement”);
•
reviewed the audited consolidated financial statements of Natus contained in its Annual Reports on Form
10-K for the three years ended December 31, 2021;
•
reviewed and discussed with Natus’ management certain other publicly available information concerning
Natus;
48TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
reviewed and discussed with Natus’ management certain non-publicly available information concerning
Natus, including, without limitation, internal financial analyses, financial projections, reports, and other
information prepared by its management, including, without limitation, Natus’ strategic plan (the “Natus
Strategic Plan”), utilized by Stifel pursuant to instructions from Natus, and held discussions with Natus’
senior management regarding recent developments;
•
reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available information concerning the terms of selected merger and
acquisition transactions that Stifel considered relevant to its analysis;
•
reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial and stock market data relating to selected public
companies that Stifel deemed relevant to its analysis;
•
participated in certain discussions and negotiations between representatives of Natus and the Parent;
•
reviewed the reported prices and trading activity of the equity securities of Natus;
•
reviewed and analyzed, based on the Natus Strategic Plan, the cash flows generated by Natus to determine
the present value of those discounted cash flows;
•
considered the results of Stifel’s efforts, at the direction of Natus, to solicit indications of interest from
selected third parties with respect to a merger or other transaction with Natus;
•
conducted such other financial studies, analyses, and investigations and considered such other
information as Stifel deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of the Opinion; and
•
took into account its assessment of general economic, market, and financial conditions and Stifel’s
experience in other transactions, as well as Stifel’s experience in securities valuations and its knowledge of
Natus’ industry generally.
In conducting its review and rendering the Opinion, Stifel relied upon and assumed, without independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was provided to Stifel by or on behalf
of Natus, or that was otherwise reviewed by Stifel, and Stifel did not assume any responsibility for independently
verifying any of such information. With respect to the financial forecasts supplied to Stifel by Natus (including,
without limitation, the financial forecasts contained in the Natus Strategic Plan and the price to be received for certain
assets (the “Specified Assets”) assumed to be divested in the Natus Strategic Plan), Stifel assumed, at the direction
of Natus, that they were reasonably prepared on the basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of Natus as to the future operating and financial performance of Natus and that they
provided a reasonable basis upon which Stifel could form its opinion. Such forecasts and projections were not
prepared with the expectation of public disclosure. All such forecasted and projected financial information was based
on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to
general economic and competitive conditions, including, without limitation, assumptions regarding the widespread
disruption, extraordinary uncertainty, and unusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the conflict in Ukraine. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such forecasted
and projected financial information. Stifel relied on this forecasted and projected information, including, without
limitation, estimates of the management of Natus of the price to be received for the Specified Assets, without
independent verification or analyses and did not in any respect assume any responsibility for the accuracy or
completeness thereof. Stifel expressed no opinion as to any such forecasted or projected information or any other
estimates or the assumptions on which they were made.
Stifel also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, business, or prospects of Natus since the date of the last financial information made available to Stifel.
Stifel did not make or obtain any independent evaluation, appraisal, or physical inspection of Natus’ assets or
liabilities, nor was Stifel furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Estimates of values of companies and assets
do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold.
Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, Stifel assumed no responsibility for their accuracy.
Stifel assumed that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ materially from the Draft Merger Agreement.
Stifel also assumed the Merger would be consummated substantially on the terms and conditions described in the
Merger Agreement without any waiver of material terms or conditions by Natus or any other
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
party and without any anti-dilution or other adjustment to the Merger Consideration, and that obtaining any
necessary regulatory approvals or satisfying any other conditions for the consummation of the Merger would not
have an adverse effect on Natus or the Merger. Stifel also assumed that the Merger would be consummated in a
manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal, state and foreign statutes, rules and
regulations. Stifel further assumed that Natus has relied upon the advice of its counsel, independent accountants,
and other advisors (other than Stifel) as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting, and regulatory matters with
respect to Natus, the Merger, and the Merger Agreement.
The Opinion was limited to whether, as of the date of the Opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of
Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares), from a financial point of view, and did not address any other
terms, aspects or implications of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any
consequences of the Merger on Natus, its stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects or implications
of any voting, support, stockholder or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered
into in connection with the Merger or otherwise. The Opinion also did not consider, address or include: (i) any other
strategic alternatives currently (or which have been or may be) contemplated by the Board of Directors or Natus; (ii)
the legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting or regulatory consequences of the Merger on Natus or the holders of
Shares; (iii) the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Natus’ officers, directors or
employees, or class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of Natus’ securities or otherwise;
(iv) the effect of the Merger on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class of
securities of Natus, or any class of securities of any other party to any transaction contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; (v) whether the Parent had sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it
to pay the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock at the closing of the Merger; or (vi) the
treatment of, or effect of the Merger on, Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company
Options. Furthermore, Stifel did not express any opinion herein as to the prices, trading range, or volume at which
Natus’ securities would trade following the public announcement of the Merger.
The Opinion was necessarily based on economic, market, financial, and other conditions as they existed on, and on
the information made available to Stifel by or on behalf of Natus or its advisors, or information otherwise reviewed by
Stifel as of the date of the Opinion. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion
reached in the Opinion and that Stifel does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm the Opinion. Further,
as the Board of Directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility
and Stifel expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on Natus, the Parent, or the
Merger.
Stifel is not a legal, tax, regulatory or bankruptcy advisor. Stifel has not considered any potential legislative or
regulatory changes currently being considered or recently enacted by the United States Congress, the various
federal banking agencies, the SEC, or any other regulatory bodies, or any changes in accounting methods or
generally accepted accounting principles that may be adopted by the SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or any changes in regulatory accounting principles that may be adopted by any or all of the federal banking
agencies. The Opinion is not a solvency opinion and did not in any way address the solvency or financial condition
of Natus or the Parent or any other person. The Opinion was approved by Stifel’s fairness opinion committee.
The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by Stifel in arriving at the Opinion and
presented by Stifel to the Board of Directors. In accordance with customary investment banking practice, Stifel
employed generally accepted valuation methods and financial analyses in reaching the Opinion. These summaries of
financial analyses alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses Stifel employed in reaching
its conclusions. None of the analyses performed by Stifel were assigned a greater significance by Stifel than any
other, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by
Stifel. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The per share equity
values implied by Stifel’s analyses are rounded to the nearest dollar. In order to fully understand the financial
analyses used by Stifel, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The summary text describing each financial analysis does
not constitute a complete description of Stifel’s financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, and if viewed in isolation could create a
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Stifel. The summary text set forth below does
not represent and should not be viewed by anyone as constituting conclusions reached by Stifel with respect to any
of the analyses performed by it in connection with the Opinion. Rather, Stifel made its determination as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses performed.
Except as otherwise noted, the information utilized by Stifel in its analyses, to the extent based on market data, was
based on market data as it existed on or before April 17, 2022, and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions. The analyses described below do not purport to be indicative of actual future results or to reflect the
prices at which any securities may trade in the public markets, which may vary depending upon various factors,
including changes in interest rates, dividend rates, market conditions, economic conditions and other factors that
influence the price of securities.
Selected Public Companies Analysis
Stifel reviewed certain publicly available financial data and stock market information for several selected public
companies in the medical technology sector. The selected public companies were:
•
Avanos Medical, Inc.
•
CONMED Corporation
•
ConvaTec Group Plc
•
ICU Medical, Inc.
•
Integra LifeSciences Holdings
•
LivaNova Plc
•
Merit Medical Systems, Inc.
•
NuVasive, Inc.
•
Orthofix Medical, Inc.
For each selected public company, Stifel calculated multiples of enterprise value (defined as equity value, based on
closing stock prices on April 14, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger), plus total debt
less cash, as obtained from publicly available sources) compared to actual or estimated earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA, for calendar years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The
third quartile and first quartile multiples for the selected public companies implied by this analysis are set forth in the
table below:
2021A EBITDA
2022P

EBITDA
3rd Quartile
17.3x
18.8x
16.8x
1st Quartile
15.5x
12.7x
11.4x
Stifel then applied these EBITDA multiples to the corresponding Natus actual EBITDA for the fiscal year 2021 (“2021
EBITDA”) and the projected EBITDA for the fiscal year 2022 (“projected 2022 EBITDA”) and for the fiscal year 2023
(“projected 2023 EBITDA”), which pursuant to the Natus Strategic Plan reflected the pro forma impact of certain
potential divestitures, or the “Potential Divestitures,” to determine ranges of implied enterprise values for Natus.
Based on these implied enterprise value ranges, Stifel calculated ranges of implied equity values for Natus (calculated
as enterprise value minus total debt plus cash), with the implied equity values based on projected 2022 EBITDA and
projected 2023 EBITDA adjusted to include the net present value of the after-tax proceeds from the Potential
Divestitures as set forth in the Natus Strategic Plan (the “Estimated Divestiture Proceeds”), as estimated by Natus
management. The per share equity value ranges for Natus implied by this analysis are set forth in the table below:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
No company utilized in the selected public company analysis is identical to Natus. Stifel chose the selected public
companies on the basis of various factors, including the size of the companies, the similarity of the lines of business
and the similarity of the financial profiles, although no company is identical to Natus. Accordingly, these analyses are
not purely mathematical, but also involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies and other factors.
Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis
Stifel reviewed certain publicly available information relating to 22 selected business combination transactions
announced on or subsequent to February 26, 2015, involving medical technology companies. The selected precedent
transactions are set forth in the table below:

For each selected precedent transaction, Stifel calculated the enterprise value implied for the target company, based
on the upfront consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company’s last twelve
months (“LTM”) and next twelve months (“NTM”) estimated EBITDA. Estimated financial data of the selected
transactions were based on publicly available information. The third quartile and first quartile multiples for the
selected precedent transactions implied by this analysis are set forth in the table below:
LTM EBITDA
NTM EBITDA
3rd Quartile
16.1x
15.3x
1st Quartile

Stifel then applied the LTM EBITDA multiples to Natus’ actual 2021 EBITDA and the NTM EBITDA multiples to
Natus’ projected 2022 EBITDA, adjusted to include the net present value of the after-tax proceeds (as estimated by
Natus management) from the Estimated Divestiture Proceeds. Based on these implied enterprise value ranges, Stifel
calculated ranges of implied equity values for Natus. The implied range based on projected 2022 EBITDA was
adjusted to include the Estimated Divestiture Proceeds. The per share equity value ranges for Natus implied by this
analysis are set forth in the table below:

No transaction utilized in the selected precedent transaction analysis is identical to the Merger. Stifel chose the
selected precedent transactions on the basis of various factors and no company is identical to Natus. Accordingly,
these analyses are not purely mathematical, but also involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the
differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved in the selected precedent
transactions and other factors.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Stifel used Natus management’s financial projections of unlevered free cash flow for fiscal years 2022 through 2026
contained in the Natus Strategic Plan to perform a discounted cash flow analysis of Natus. Financial projections for
the fiscal year 2022 reflected the pro forma impact of the Potential Divestitures assuming the Potential Divestitures
occurred on June 30, 2022.
Stifel calculated the terminal value of Natus’ projected unlevered free cash flow by applying a range of perpetuity
growth rates of 2.0% to 4.0% to Natus’ projected calendar year 2026 free cash flow. Stifel then discounted the cash
flows and terminal value to present values using discount rates ranging from 10% to 12%, based on Natus’ weighted
average cost of capital, using the capital asset pricing model, considering Natus’ company-specific circumstances
and Stifel’s judgment. This analysis yielded a range of implied enterprise values for Natus from which Stifel calculated
a range of implied equity values for Natus. The per share equity value range for Natus implied by this analysis ranges
from $24 to $36.
Other Information
For the information of the Board of Directors, Stifel also prepared certain other analyses for illustrative purposes only
and not as part of its fairness analysis.
Premiums Paid Analysis
For illustrative purposes only, Stifel reviewed the premiums paid for acquisitions of 278 publicly traded U.S.
companies announced, and subsequently completed, from January 1, 2016 to April 14, 2022, where the total
transaction value was between $500.0 million and $2.0 billion, excluding spinoffs, minority stakes, and insolvency-
related deals. Stifel calculated the percentage by which the upfront per share consideration paid in such transactions
exceeded the target company’s closing share price one day prior to the announcement of such precedent transaction.
The resultants of Stifel’s calculations are as follows:
1-Day (%) 
Offer Premiums
3rd Quartile
43.6
1st Quartile
9.7
Stifel then applied these premiums to the closing price of Natus’ shares on April 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to
the announcement of the Merger, resulting in implied per share values set forth in the table below.
3rd Quartile - Implied Equity Value Per Share
$37
1st Quartile - Implied Equity Value Per Share
$29
Historical Trading Range for the Company Common Stock
For illustrative purposes only, Stifel reviewed the historical trading prices of the Company Common Stock for the 52
weeks prior to the date of the announcement of the Merger. During this period, the closing price per share of the
Company Common Stock ranged from $22 to $30.
Miscellaneous
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its Opinion, Stifel considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did
not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Stifel believes that
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the summary provided and the analyses described above must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions
of these analyses, without considering all of them, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying Stifel’s
analyses and Opinion; therefore, the ranges of valuations and relative valuations resulting from any particular
analysis described above should not be taken to be Stifel’s view of the actual valuation of the company or its relative
valuation.
Stifel is acting as financial advisor to Natus in connection with the Merger. Natus agreed to pay Stifel a fee for its
services that as of the date of the Merger Agreement was estimated to be approximately $18 million, $1.5 million of
which became payable upon the delivery of the Opinion, and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the
closing of the Merger. Natus has also agreed to reimburse Stifel for its expenses incurred in connection with Stifel’s
engagement and to indemnify Stifel and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents,
and any persons controlling Stifel or any of its affiliates, against specified liabilities. In the ordinary course of
business, Stifel and its clients may transact in the equity securities of each of Natus or Parent or its affiliates and may
at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Stifel may seek to provide investment banking or financial
advisory services to Natus or Parent and its affiliates in the future, for which Stifel would seek customary
compensation.
In their Opinion, Stifel also confirmed to the Board of Directors that there were no material relationships that existed
during the two years prior to the date of the Opinion or that were mutually understood to be contemplated in which
any compensation was received or was intended to be received as a result of the relationship between Stifel and any
party to the Merger.",57,63
NATUS MEDICAL INC_20220602_DEFM14A_20144466_4472051.Pdf,Management Projections,"Management Projections
Natus does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance or earnings beyond the
current fiscal year and is especially wary of making projections for extended earnings periods given, among other
reasons, the unpredictability and uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Natus is
including in this proxy statement certain financial projections prepared by Natus management in February 2022,
which we refer to as the “Management Projections,” to reflect Natus management’s then-current expectations of
Natus’ financial performance for fiscal years 2022 through 2026.
We have included a summary of the Management Projections to give stockholders access to certain nonpublic
information prepared by Natus management for the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the
Merger and the Per Share Price, which were also provided to Stifel, who was directed by the Board of Directors to use
the Management Projections in their financial analyses with respect to the fairness of the $33.50 per share
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These Management Projections were also made
available to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parent’s request, in connection with their due diligence review of Natus. The
inclusion of the Management Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Natus, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this
information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of actual future results.
The Management Projections were developed by Natus management on a standalone basis without giving effect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the Management
Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. The Management
Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Management Projections were based are subjective in
many respects. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and reflect numerous estimates
and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions,
changes to the business, financial condition or results of operations of Natus and other matters, including those
described under “Forward-Looking Statements,” many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant
economic and competitive uncertainties, are beyond Natus’ control and may cause the Management Projections or
the underlying assumptions not to be realized. Since the Management Projections cover multiple years, such
information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The Management Projections do not
take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared. As a result, there can be
no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or
lower than projected. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward
complying with GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC
54TABLE OF CONTENTS
regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. For example, certain metrics included in the
Management Projections are non-GAAP measures, and the Management Projections do not include footnote
disclosures as may be required by GAAP. The prospective financial information included in this document has been
prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Natus’ management. Natus’ Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled, nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the
accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, Natus’ Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the
Management Projections below. No one has made or makes any representation to any stockholder regarding the
information included in the Management Projections. The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information about Natus contained in Natus’s public
filings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can
Find More Information.”
For the foregoing reasons the inclusion of specific portions of the Management Projections in this proxy statement
should not be regarded as necessarily predictive of actual future events, and they should not be relied on as such.

order to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or
not to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock. In addition, the Management
Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date they were prepared or as
of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Natus does not intend to
update or otherwise revise the Management Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances
existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the
underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or
in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described below. In (i) evaluating and negotiating
the Merger Agreement; (ii) recommending the adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (iii) recommending that the
Merger Agreement be adopted by Company Stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these
interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by DGCL, each current or former director and officer of Natus (and any person who becomes a
director or officer of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) (“Indemnified Person”) from and
against any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented
55TABLE OF CONTENTS
attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or
indirectly, with respect to any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to the extent
that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Merger).
During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the
Subsidiaries of Natus, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger Agreement that have been made available to Parent
prior to the date thereof. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner except as required by applicable law.
The Merger Agreement also provides during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, “D&O
Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect
to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are substantially equivalent to those of the D&O
Insurance; provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer (of the same
or better credit worthiness and financial capability) of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured thereunder. The Surviving Corporation will not be obligated
to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the annual premium amount paid by Natus for coverage for its last full
fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective
Time, Natus may (and if Natus is unable to purchase such a policy prior to Closing, Parent shall) purchase a prepaid
six-year “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy
does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If Natus (or Parent) purchases such a “tail” policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
“tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such “tail” policy
is in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time.
Treatment of Natus Equity-Based Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that Natus’ equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time:
Company Options
As of the record date, there were outstanding Company Options to purchase 169,548 shares of Company Common
Stock (all of which were In-the-Money Company Options), of which Company Options to purchase 107,894 shares of
Company Common Stock were held by our executive officers. No Company Options were held by our non-employee
directors. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, and that is an
In-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less
the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock that are issuable upon the full exercise of such Company Option.
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof.
Company Restricted Stock
As of the record date, there were outstanding 390,075 shares of Company Restricted Stock, of which 232,042 were
held by our non-employee directors and executive officers. At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with
respect to Employee Interim Awards, each share of Company Restricted Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to
any required tax withholding, equal to the Per Share Price.
Company Restricted Stock Units
As of the record date, there were outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units in respect of 1,140,733 shares of
Company Common Stock (at the maximum level with respect awards subject to performance-based vesting criteria), of
which 114,539 were subject only to time-vesting criteria, 380,570 were MSUs and 645,624 were subject to vesting
based on achievement of certain total shareholder return or earnings per share metrics (“PSUs”). Of the total number
of outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units as of the record date, our current non-employee directors and
executive officers held Company Restricted Stock Units in respect of 951,375 shares (at the maximum level with
respect to awards subject to performance-based vesting criteria). At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with
respect to Employee Interim Awards or as set forth in the CEO Retention Agreement, each Company Restricted Stock
Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not
granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be cancelled and be converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the
Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) (1) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are only subject to time-
vesting requirements, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Unit, and (2) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are subject to time- and performance-vesting
requirements, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock determined to be performance vested with the
performance goals deemed achieved at maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed
satisfied.
Employee Interim Awards
As of the record date, there were no outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock or Company Restricted Stock
Units that were Employee Interim Awards. At the Effective Time, any Employee Interim Awards that are outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any
Company Stock Plan, will be treated at the Effective Time in the manner set forth above, provided that any applicable
performance goals will be deemed achieved at target levels (rather than at maximum) and the number of shares subject
to such Employee Interim Awards that will vest at the Effective Time will be prorated to reflect the portion of the
applicable vesting period that has elapsed from the date of grant until the Effective Time (rather than vesting in full),
and the remaining unvested portion of any Employee Interim Awards will be forfeited at the Effective Time.
CEO Retention Agreement
Pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that, notwithstanding the treatment of Company
Restricted Stock Units set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described above), he would not receive payment in
respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units that are MSUs based on deemed achievement of performance goals at
maximum levels. Instead, Mr. Sullivan’s MSUs will be deemed attained at the level of performance actually achieved
through the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately 143.4% of target, in the case of MSUs
granted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in
January 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The consequence to Mr. Sullivan will be a reduction by over $3,000,000 in the amount of gross proceeds that he
otherwise was entitled to receive and would have received in respect of his MSUs.
Furthermore, pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the
“Retention Payment”) payable to him at the Effective Time in respect of his Company
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Restricted Stock Units would not become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, would become payable 50% on
the six-month anniversary of the Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his
continued employment with the Company until the relevant retention date. If Mr. Sullivan’s employment is terminated
by the Company without cause, by Mr. Sullivan with good reason, or due to his death or disability, any then-unpaid
portion of the Retention Payment shall be paid to him upon his termination (subject to, in the case of a termination by
the Company without cause or by Mr. Sullivan for good reason, his execution and non-revocation of a release of
claims). If Mr. Sullivan’s employment terminates for any other reason prior to the relevant retention date, he will
immediately forfeit all portions of the Retention Payment that relate to a future retention date. Mr. Sullivan’s right to
receive the Retention Payment is further subject to his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants.
Treatment of ESPP
There are no outstanding purchase rights under the Company’s 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Even if the
Amended and Restated 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is adopted by the Company’s stockholders at its 2022
annual meeting, the Merger Agreement does not permit any employee to commence participation in the ESPP and
requires that the ESPP be terminated as of the Effective Time.
Payments Upon Termination In Connection with a Change of Control
Change of Control Severance Benefits.
We have entered into employment agreements with each of our currently employed named executive officers (except
for Dr. Chung) that provide for severance payments and benefits upon certain terminations of employment, including
following a change of control, subject to the named executive officer’s execution of an effective release of claims and
continued compliance with an 18-month (or, for Mr. Sullivan, 24-month) post-termination of employment employee
non-solicitation covenant and other restrictive covenants. The severance payments and benefits that could become
payable under these agreements in connection with a change of control are summarized below. As used in the
summary below, the terms “cause,” “good reason,” and “change of control” have the meanings set forth in the
applicable employment agreement:
Employment Agreement and CEO Retention Agreement with Mr. Sullivan
In connection with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer on December 27, 2021, we entered into
an employment agreement with Mr. Sullivan. Pursuant to his employment agreement with us, in the event that Mr.
Sullivan’s employment terminates other than for cause, death or disability or Mr. Sullivan resigns for good reason, in
each case, within three months prior to or 24 months following the Effective Time, he would be entitled to the
following severance payments and benefits:
•
A lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary and target annual bonus as then
in effect or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to our entering into the Merger Agreement, payable
within 30 days following such termination;
•
A prorated target annual bonus for the year of termination, with the prorated amount based on the number
of days that Mr. Sullivan was employed during the year prior to termination of service, paid no later than
March 15 of the year following such termination; and
•
Continuation of the level of group health coverage provided by the Company to Mr. Sullivan and his
eligible dependents at the time of termination until the third December 31st from the effective date of such
termination (or, if earlier, the date that Mr. Sullivan and each of his eligible dependents become covered
under similar plans).
Mr. Sullivan’s entitlement to the foregoing severance payments is conditioned upon (i) the executive executing and
not revoking a release of claims in favor of the Company and its officers and directors and (ii) the executive’s
compliance with a 24-month employee and customer non-solicitation covenant (and in the event of a breach, Mr.
Sullivan is required to return to the Company a prorated amount of the foregoing cash severance payments,
determined by multiplying the amount of cash payments by a fraction, the numerator of which is 24 minus the number
of months from the date of termination to the date of breach, and the denominator of which is 24).
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
If, prior to the 12-month anniversary of the Effective Time, Mr. Sullivan’s employment is terminated by the Company,
Parent or one of their respective affiliates without cause, by Mr. Sullivan for good reason or as a result of Mr.
Sullivan’s death or disability, in accordance with the CEO Retention Agreement, all unpaid portions of the Retention
Payment will be paid to Mr. Sullivan by the Company as soon as practicable but no later than the earlier of (x) 55 days
after the date of such termination and (y) the second regular payroll date following the Effective Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a termination without cause or for good reason, a condition precedent
to the Company’s obligation to pay any portion of the Retention Payment that relates to a Retention Date that has
not yet occurred as of Mr. Sullivan’s termination date shall be Mr. Sullivan’s execution and delivery of a release of
claims and compliance with his non-solicitation obligation described above.
Employment Agreement with Mr. Davies
Pursuant to his employment agreement with us, in the event that Mr. Davies’ employment terminates other than for
cause, death or disability or Mr. Davies resigns for good reason, in each case, within six months following the
Effective Time, he would be entitled to the severance payments and benefits listed below:
•
Continued payment of his annual base salary for 12 months and payment of his target annual bonus (over
the same 12-month period) as then in effect or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to our entering into
the Merger Agreement, payable on the Company’s normal payroll dates commencing within 70 days
following such termination; and
•
Continued payment by the Company of the health continuation coverage premiums for Mr. Davies and his
eligible dependents for 12 months following the termination (or, if earlier, the date that Mr. Davies and his
eligible dependents become covered under similar plans).
Mr. Davies’ receipt of the foregoing severance payments and benefits is conditioned upon Mr. Davies (i) signing and
not revoking a release of claims in favor of the Company and (ii) complying with certain restrictive covenants,
including a noncompetition covenant (for the duration of the severance period) and an 18-month employee non-
solicitation covenant.
Employment Agreement with Mr. Noll
Pursuant to his employment agreement with us, Mr. Noll would be entitled to the following severance payments and
benefits in the event that Mr. Noll’s employment terminates other than for cause, death or disability or if he resigns
for good reason, in each case, within six months following the Effective Time, he would be entitled to the severance
payments and benefits listed below:
•
Continued payment of his annual base salary for 12 months and payment of a target annual bonus (paid
over the same 12-month period) as then in effect or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to our entering
into the Merger Agreement, payable on the Company’s normal payroll dates commencing within 70 days
following such termination; and
•
Continued payment by the Company of the health continuation coverage premiums for Mr. Noll and his
eligible dependents for six months following the termination (or, if earlier, the date that Mr. Noll and his
eligible dependents become covered under similar plans).
Mr. Noll’s receipt of the foregoing severance payments and benefits is conditioned upon Mr. Noll (i) signing and not
revoking a release of claims in favor of the Company and (ii) complying with certain restrictive covenants, including a
noncompetition covenant (for the duration of the severance period) and an 18-month employee non-solicitation
covenant.
Part-Time Employment Agreement with Dr. Chung
Dr. Chung’s full-time employment agreement with us was terminated on April 1, 2022 due to his retirement. In
connection with his retirement, he entered into a part-time employment agreement with us effective April 2, 2022,
which does not provide for any benefits in connection with his termination of employment or a change of control,
except as described in the following sentence. However, pursuant to Dr. Chung’s part-time employment agreement,
the equity-based awards that he held on April 1, 2022 remained outstanding and will continue to vest based on his
service and, if outstanding at the Effective Time, will be treated in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Internal Revenue Code Section 280G
The Employment Agreements with Messrs. Sullivan, Davies and Noll provide that the payments and benefits that the
applicable executive officer otherwise would receive in connection with a change of control will be reduced to the
extent necessary to avoid imposition of the “golden parachute” excise tax pursuant to Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code, but only if such reduction would result in such executive officer retaining a greater amount of such
payments and benefits on a net after-tax basis than had no reduction been made.
Golden Parachute Compensation
In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger or that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. Please see “Treatment of Natus Equity-Based Awards” and “Payments Upon
Termination in Connection with Change of Control” for further information regarding this compensation.
The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for
the purposes of this table, that the Merger is consummated on June 30, 2022, and with respect to the cash payments
and perquisite/benefit amounts, that the employment of each of the named executive officers is subject to an
involuntary termination without “cause”, or the named executive officer resigns with “good reason”, on such date.
Natus’ named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation enhancements, tax
reimbursements or other benefits in connection with the Merger. However, we intend to terminate our nonqualified
deferred compensation plan prior to the Effective Time, in which case deferrals under the plan will cease and each
named executive officer (as well as each other participant) who has an account balance under such plan would
receive accelerated payment of such balance (which is fully vested regardless of the Merger) promptly following the
Effective Time.
Some of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger (i.e.
without regard to whether a termination of employment occurs). In addition to the assumptions regarding the
consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on certain other
assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to
be received by named executive officers in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.",64,69

This amount represents the “double trigger” cash severance payments to which each of Messrs. Sullivan, Davies and Noll may
become entitled under his employment agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Interests of
Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Payments Upon Termination in Connection with a Change of Control,”
and, in the case of Mr. Sullivan, the Retention Payment pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement. In the case of Mr. Sullivan,
the amount set forth above represents (i) an amount equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary and target annual bonus
as currently in effect, (ii) an amount representing his prorated annual bonus for the year of termination and (iii) his Retention
Payment. For Messrs. Davies and Noll, the amount represents the named executive officer’s annual base salary and target annual
bonus as currently in effect. For Messrs. Sullivan, Davies and Noll, the cash severance payments are contingent upon the
effectiveness of a release of claims and compliance with restrictive covenants, as described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Payments Upon Termination in Connection with a
Change of Control.” Furthermore, in the case of Mr. Sullivan, in the event of his termination without cause or for good reason,
the Company’s obligation to pay any portion of the Retention Payment that relates to a retention date that has not yet occurred
as of his termination date is contingent on the effectiveness of a release of claims and compliance with such restrictive
covenants. The individual components of this column are quantified in the table immediately below.

This amount represents the “single trigger” payments due with respect to each named executive officer’s Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units under the Merger Agreement. This amount represents the sum
of (x) in the case of Company Options, an amount equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per
share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are
issuable upon the full exercise of such Company Option; (y) in the case of Company Restricted Stock Units, an amount equal to
(i) the amount of the Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) (1) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are only subject
to time-vesting requirements, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Unit, and (2) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are subject to time- and performance-vesting requirements,
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock determined to be performance vested with the performance goals deemed
achieved at maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied (except with respect to Mr.
Sullivan) and (z) in the case of each share of Company Restricted Stock, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Price. For Mr.
Sullivan, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the CEO Retention Agreement, the amount reflects Mr. Sullivan’s MSUs deemed
attained at the level of performance actually achieved through the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately
143.4% of target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs
granted to Mr. Sullivan in January 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company’s stockholders; furthermore,
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the CEO Retention Agreement, the amount otherwise payable in respect of Mr. Sullivan’s
Company Restricted Stock Units has been reduced in the table above by an amount equal to the $6,000,000 Retention Payment.
The Retention Payment would otherwise have been payable to Mr. Sullivan at the Effective Time in respect of his Company
Restricted Stock Units but will not become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, will become payable 50% on the six-
month anniversary of the Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his continued employment
with the Company until the relevant retention date (except as described in Note (1) above).
(3)
This amount equals the estimated value of the “double trigger” health insurance benefits to which each named executive officer
may become entitled to under his or her employment agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Payments Upon Termination in Connection with Change of
Control.” For Mr. Sullivan, the amount above represents the cost of continuation of the level of group health coverage currently
provided by the Company to him and his eligible dependents until the third December 31st from the effective date of such
termination. For Messrs. Davies and Noll, the amount above represents continued payment by the Company of the health
continuation coverage premiums for the named executive officer and his eligible dependents for 12 months following termination
(in the case of Mr. Davies) or six months following termination (in the case of Mr. Noll). For Messrs. Sullivan, Davies and Noll,
the health insured benefits are contingent upon the effectiveness of a release of claims and compliance with restrictive covenants
as described in “Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger-Payments Upon Termination in Connection with
a Change of Control.”
(4)
Under the respective employment agreements, amounts are subject to reduction in the event the named executive officer would
be better off on an after-tax basis being cutback to a level such that the penalties and excise taxes under Sections 280G and 4999
of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply. The amounts in this table do not reflect any such reduction.
(5)
Dr. Chung’s full-time employment agreement with us was terminated on April 1, 2022 due to his retirement. In connection with
his retirement, he entered into a part-time employment agreement with us effective April 2, 2022, which does not provide for
any benefits in connection with his termination of employment or a change of control, except as described in the following
sentence. However, pursuant to Dr. Chung’s part-time employment agreement, the equity-based awards that he held on April 1,
2022 remained outstanding and will continue to vest based on his service and, if outstanding at the Effective Time, will be treated
in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

Mr. Kennedy resigned from his employment on December 13, 2021, and will not be receiving any cash or equity compensation in
connection with the Merger.

Officer. Our non-employee directors will receive regular annual grants of shares of Company Restricted Stock in the ordinary
course following our 2022 annual shareholder meeting on June 15, 2022, the grant date values of which were previously disclosed

NATUS MEDICAL INC_20220602_DEFM14A_20144466_4472051.Pdf,Financing of the Merger,"Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be
approximately $1.2 billion. This amount includes the funds needed to: (1) pay stockholders the amounts due under
the Merger Agreement; (2) make payments in respect of our outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the
Merger Agreement; and (3) pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger
Agreement.
Although the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing
condition, the Merger Agreement provides that, in no event, will the Closing of the Merger occur before June 16,
2022.
Equity Financing
Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), Med Platform II has
agreed to provide Parent with an equity commitment of up to approximately $840,000,000 in cash, which will be
available to fund the aggregate purchase price and the other payments contemplated by, and subject to the terms and
available to fund the aggregate purchase price and the other payments contemplated by, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, the Merger Agreement.
The Equity Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that: (1) Natus is an express third party beneficiary
thereof in connection with Natus’ exercise of its rights related to specific performance under the Merger Agreement;
and (2) Natus will be entitled to specific performance in connection with the exercise of such third party beneficiary
rights. The Equity Commitment Letter may not be waived, amended or modified except by a written instrument signed
by Parent, Med Platform II and the Company.
Limited Guaranty
Pursuant to the limited guaranty delivered by Med Platform II in favor of Natus, dated as of April 17, 2022 (the
“Limited Guaranty”), Med Platform II has agreed to guaranty the payment of the Parent Termination Fee and certain
other expenses that may be payable by Parent under the Merger Agreement.
The obligations of Med Platform II under the Limited Guaranty are subject to an aggregate cap equal to $89,014,704.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Limited Guaranty will terminate upon the earliest of:
•
the Closing;
•
the valid termination of the Merger Agreement by mutual written consent of Parent and Natus, or under
circumstances in which Parent and Merger Sub would not be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee
under the Merger Agreement; and
•
subject to certain exceptions in the Merger Agreement, the two month anniversary after any valid
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (other than the circumstances described
in the foregoing clause).
Debt Financing
In connection with the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub entered into a debt commitment letter on April 17, 2022 with

NATUS MEDICAL INC_20220602_DEFM14A_20144466_4472051.Pdf,Appraisal Rights,"Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL are met, Natus
stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand an appraisal
of their shares of Company Common Stock, who continuously hold such shares of Company Common Stock from the
date of demand through the Effective Time of the Merger and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section
262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL
(“Section 262”). Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a
“stockholder” are to a record holder of Company Common Stock.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other
advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Natus stockholders exercise their
64TABLE OF CONTENTS
appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled to
demand appraisal rights for the shares of Company Common Stock registered in that holder’s name. A person having
a beneficial interest in shares of Company Common Stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a
bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder’s
shares. If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to
exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee to ensure that appraisal
rights are exercised.
Under Section 262, holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock who (1) deliver a written demand for
appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of Company Common Stock to Natus prior to the vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (3) continuously are the
record holders of such shares of Company Common Stock from the date of demand through the Effective Time; and
(4) otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of Company
Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of
the shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. However, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal
proceedings as to all Natus stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
eligible for appraisal; or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Price in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million
(conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its
discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound
quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the
Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to
each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such
payment only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid and the “fair value” determined by the
Court of Chancery, and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.
The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of
judgment.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholder meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of
record as of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a
copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Natus’ notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available
in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In
connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly
comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights
under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price
without interest. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock, Natus believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that
stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock must do
ALL of the following:
•
the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the stockholder must deliver to Natus a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger
Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting; and
•
the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Company Common Stock from the date of making the
demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the
shares of Company Common Stock before the Effective Time).
In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote
against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock.
Filing Written Demand
A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Natus, before the vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will
be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of Company
Common Stock, and that stockholder must not vote, in person (virtually) or by proxy, in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares of Company Common
Stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of Company
Common Stock of record through the Effective Time. Neither voting (in person (virtually) or by proxy) against the
adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262.
The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the
Merger Agreement. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption
of the Merger Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares
registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Company Common Stock should be
executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Natus of the identity of the holder and
state that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of Company Common
Stock. If the shares of Company Common Stock are owned of record in the name of another person, such as a broker,
fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if
such shares of Company Common Stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and
tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including
an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record;
however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand,
the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If a stockholder holds shares of Company Common Stock
through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a
demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the
depository nominee as record holder.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK
ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD
CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR
APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL
INTEREST IN SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER
PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD
HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT
APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:
Natus Medical Incorporated
3150 Pleasant View Road
Middleton, WI 53562
Attention: Corporate Secretary
Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered
pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Natus a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However,
any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written
approval of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of
66
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just;
provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to
accept the Per Share Price within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each
record holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section
262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective
and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal
rights under Section 262 (or a beneficial owner in the circumstances described in the next paragraph) may commence
an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving
Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares
held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present
intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate
any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Company Common Stock. Accordingly, any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to
perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Company Common Stock within the time and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days
after the Effective Time, stockholders’ rights to appraisal shall cease, and all holders of shares of Company Common
Stock will be entitled to receive the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
who has complied with the requirements for an appraisal of such holder’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be
entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with
respect to which Natus has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares of
Company Common Stock. The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the requesting stockholder within
ten (10) days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Company Common
Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above,
however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock and a copy thereof is
served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days
after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all stockholders who have demanded appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock and with
whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required
by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the stockholders who
have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of Company Common Stock to
submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.
Pursuant to Section 262(g), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Natus
stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
appraisal exceeds 1% of Natus’ outstanding shares of Company Common Stock eligible for appraisal; or (2) the value
of the aggregate Per Share Price in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Determination of Fair Value
Where proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to
be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery
will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause
shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly
and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the Surviving
Corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the
proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal. If the Surviving Corporation
makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the
sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in such voluntary cash
payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest accrued
before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of
Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating
that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial
community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires
consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in
making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that
throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v Technicolor,
Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass
known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements
of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the
merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive
pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking
firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to,
and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. No representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should
recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the
Per Share Price. Neither Natus nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Price to any stockholder
exercising appraisal rights, and each of Natus and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment
pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262,
the “fair value” of a share of Company Common Stock is less than the Per Share Price. The costs of the appraisal
proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under
the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of
all the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or
assessment, each party bears its own expenses.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock under Section 262 fails
to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of Company
Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share
Price as provided in the Merger Agreement.
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS
From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such
shares of Company Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the
stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the
Effective Time).
 Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to
consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

The completion of the Merger is conditioned on, among other things, any applicable waiting period (and any
extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”)
and certain other antitrust and foreign investment laws having expired or been terminated, or all requisite consents
pursuant thereto being obtained. Specifically, the Merger is conditioned on (i) merger control approval by (a) the
Austrian Federal Competition Authority; (b) the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission; (c) the
European Commission, but only in the event of the Merger having been referred to the European Commission
pursuant to Article (22)(1) of the EU Merger Regulation; and (d) the Competition and Markets Authority of the
United Kingdom (“CMA”), or written confirmation in response to a briefing note that the CMA does not intend to
open a Phase I investigation into the Merger; and (ii) foreign investment approval by (a) the Danish Business
Authority and (b) the Italian Government.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and Natus, on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts (x) to take (or cause to be taken)
all actions; (y) do (or cause to be done) all things; and (z) assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing (or
causing to be done) all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including by
using its reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the Merger in the Merger Agreement to be satisfied.
On April 29, 2022 and May 5, 2022, Natus and Parent, respectively, filed notification of the proposed Merger with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division under the HSR Act. The waiting period under the HSR Act is expected to expire at
11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 6, 2022.

one of the complaints under Rule 14a-9 and 17 C.F.R. § 244.100, for allegedly false and misleading statements in
Natus’ preliminary proxy statement and against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for
alleged control person liability with respect to such allegedly false or misleading statements. The Complaints seek,
among other relief, (1) to enjoin defendants from consummating the Merger; (2) to rescind the Merger or recover

by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is

in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is
important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger
Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. Capitalized terms in
this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described in this section and included in the Merger
Agreement (1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely
for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations
and supplemental information agreed to by Parent, Natus and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of
the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and, in some cases,
were qualified by matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Natus. In addition, the representations and
warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between
the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of
materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders should not rely on

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
on the closing date, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Natus and Natus will continue as the Surviving
Corporation of the Merger and a private subsidiary of Parent.
At the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Natus and Merger Sub will vest

bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal.
At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the officers of Merger Sub as of

Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated
71TABLE OF CONTENTS
certificate of incorporation will become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation; provided,
however, (i) the name of the Surviving Corporation will be the name of the Company, (ii) the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company shall omit any provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub
which named the incorporator or incorporators, the initial board of directors and the original subscribers for shares
and (iii) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses that are identical to the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter.
At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
The Closing of the Merger will take place at a closing to occur at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, by electronic exchange of
documents, on the later of (a) a date which shall be the third Business Day after the date the conditions to the Merger
set forth in the Merger Agreement and described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Conditions to the
Merger” have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver in accordance with the Merger Agreement by the party having the
benefit of the applicable condition) of all conditions at the Closing; or (b) at such other place, date and time as Natus
and Parent may agree in writing; provided that in no event will the Closing occur before June 16, 2022.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, on the closing date, Parent, Merger
Sub and Natus will cause the Merger to be consummated pursuant to the DGCL by filing a Certificate of Merger in
customary form and substance with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger in the third
calendar quarter of 2022; however, consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the completion of the Merger more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Conditions to the Merger” and we cannot specify when, or assure you that, Natus and Parent will satisfy or waive all
conditions to the Merger. There may be a substantial amount of time between the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting and the consummation of the Merger and it is possible that factors outside the control of Natus or Parent
could delay the consummation of the Merger, or prevent the Merger from being consummated; however, we expect to
consummate the Merger promptly following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions more fully described below in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “-Conditions to the Merger.”",81,82

Effect of the Merger on Natus’ Capital Stock
At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares but including each share of
Company Restricted Stock), will be cancelled and extinguished, and automatically converted into the right to receive
an amount equal to $33.50 in cash, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes.
As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock and rights or interests will no longer be outstanding
and will be cancelled and will cease to exist and will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Price
to be paid in accordance with, and subject to, the conditions of the Merger Agreement. At the Effective Time, each
share of Company Common Stock that is (1) held by Natus as treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or
(3) owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub, in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
Company Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement) who shall have neither voted in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly demanded their
statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per
Share Price pursuant to
72TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Merger Agreement. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares (each as defined below) that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the
manner provided in the Merger Agreement (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of
an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement). The Per Share Price
will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification, combination, or other similar
change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time.
Treatment of Natus Equity-Based Awards
Outstanding Equity Awards
The Merger Agreement provides that Natus’ equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time:
Company Options
At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, and that is an In-the-
Money Company Option will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the
exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock that are issuable upon the full exercise of such Company Option.
Each Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof.
Company Restricted Stock
At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with respect to Employee Interim Awards, each share of Company
Restricted Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether
or not granted pursuant to any of the Company Stock Plans, will be cancelled and converted into and will become a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to the Per
Share Price.
Company Restricted Stock Units
At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with respect to Employee Interim Awards or as set forth in the CEO
Retention Agreement, each Company Restricted Stock Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be cancelled and
be converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any required
tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) (1) with respect to Company
Restricted Stock Units that are only subject to time-vesting requirements, the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit, and (2) with respect to Company Restricted Stock
Units that are subject to time- and performance-vesting requirements, the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock determined to be performance vested with the performance goals deemed achieved at maximum levels
and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied.
Employee Interim Awards
At the Effective Time, any Employee Interim Awards that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be treated at
the Effective Time in the manner set forth above, provided that any applicable performance goals will be deemed
73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
achieved at target levels (rather than at maximum) and the number of shares subject to such Employee Interim Awards
that will vest at the Effective Time will be prorated to reflect the portion of the applicable vesting period that has
elapsed from the date of grant until the Effective Time (rather than vesting in full), and the remaining unvested
portion of any Employee Interim Awards will be forfeited at the Effective Time.
ESPP
There are no outstanding purchase rights under the Company’s 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Even if the ESPP
is adopted by the Company’s stockholders at its 2022 annual meeting, the Merger Agreement does not permit any
employee to commence participation in the ESPP and requires that the ESPP be terminated as of the Effective Time.
CEO Retention Agreement
Pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that, notwithstanding the treatment of Company
Restricted Stock Units set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described above), he would not receive payment in
respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units that are MSUs based on deemed achievement of performance goals at
maximum levels. Instead, Mr. Sullivan’s MSUs will be deemed attained at the level of performance actually achieved
through the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately 143.4% of target, in the case of MSUs
granted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in
January 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
The consequence to Mr. Sullivan will be a reduction by over $3,000,000 in the amount of gross proceeds that he
otherwise was entitled to receive and would have received in respect of his MSUs.
Furthermore, pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the
“Retention Payment”) payable to him at the Effective Time in respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units would
not become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, would become payable 50% on the six-month anniversary of
the Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his continued employment with the
Company until the relevant retention date. If Mr. Sullivan’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause,
by Mr. Sullivan with good reason, or due to his death or disability, any then-unpaid portion of the Retention Payment
shall be paid to him upon his termination (subject to, in the case of a termination by the Company without cause or
by Mr. Sullivan for good reason, his execution and non-revocation of a release of claims). If Mr. Sullivan’s
employment terminates for any other reason prior to the relevant retention date, he will immediately forfeit all portions
of the Retention Payment that relate to a future retention date. Mr. Sullivan’s right to receive the Retention Payment is
further subject to his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants.

Payment Agent
Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Natus to act as the
payment agent for the Merger and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Natus, with such payment agent.
Exchange Fund
At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, (i) for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, an amount of cash
equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock have become entitled
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) for payment to the holders of Company Restricted Stock,
Company Restricted Stock Units and/or In-the-Money Company Options who are not current or former employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, “Non-Employee Holders”), an amount in cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units
and/or In-the-Money Company Options have become entitled pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, such cash will be invested by the
payment agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the
United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
74TABLE OF CONTENTS
and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any
proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (1) there are any losses with respect to any investments
of the Exchange Fund; (2) the Exchange Fund diminishes or is otherwise for any reason below the level required for
the payment agent to promptly pay the cash amounts owed pursuant to the Merger Agreement; or (3) all or any
portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the payment agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay
the cash amounts owed pursuant to the Merger Agreement for any reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the payment agent
to make the payments owed pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund
will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
Payment Procedure
Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days of the Closing), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of (1) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares, Owned Company Shares and shares of
Company Restricted Stock) (the “Certificates”); and (2) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock that
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares, Owned
Company Shares and shares of Company Restricted Stock) (the “Uncertificated Shares”) (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the Merger Agreement. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the payment agent, together with such
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto (or in the case of
a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the
provisions of the Merger Agreement), the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding taxes
payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an
“agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(I) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred
Uncertificated Shares; by (II) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled.
The payment agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the payment agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per
Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
DTC Payment
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Natus will cooperate to establish procedures with the payment agent and the
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that the payment agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees
on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately
75
TABLE OF CONTENTS
available funds, equal to (x)(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares,
Company Restricted Stock and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price plus (y) the aggregate amount in cash owed to Non-
Employee Holders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Transfers of Ownership
If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger
of Natus, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or
transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Natus, the Per Share Price may
be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of Natus only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for surrender and transfer and the person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)
that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Price with
respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are
registered.
No Liability
None of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares
of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.
Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent
Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have
not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of
Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the Merger Agreement will thereafter look for payment of the Per
Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two
years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders
(and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock
From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any
shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance with the Merger Agreement, or in the case of Dissenting Company
Shares, the rights pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger” will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures described herein) be cancelled and exchanged as described
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger.”
76
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates
In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the payment agent will issue in exchange
therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable as described
herein. Parent or the payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per
Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Required Withholding
Each of the payment agent, Parent, Natus and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
cash amounts payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Options or any other
individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation), limited liability company, joint stock company, general
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust, firm, Governmental Authority
or other enterprise, association, organization or entity (any “Person”) such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom pursuant to any applicable tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
No Dividends or Distributions
No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on
or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

Board of Directors
Go Shop Period
Notwithstanding the below, from the period beginning on April 17, 2022 and continuing until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time,
on May 17, 2022 (the “Go-Shop Period End Date”), Natus and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors (collectively, “Representatives”)
were permitted to:
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or encourage, facilitate or
assist, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement);
•
furnish public information to any Person and/or furnish to any person that has entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement or its Representatives (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) any non-
public information relating to Natus or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any such Person or its
Representatives access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information,
or to any personnel, of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or to encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or inquiry that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; provided
that the Company shall provide access to Parent and Merger Sub of any non-public information that the
Company has provided, or that is otherwise provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Representatives, to any Person given such access that was not previously made available (whether prior to
or after the execution of the Merger Agreement) to Parent or Merger Sub substantially concurrently with
the time it is provided to such Person and, unless otherwise agreed by Parent, in the same manner so
provided to such Person; or
•
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person or its Representatives that has
entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case subject to the
notice requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Natus will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the Go-Shop Period End Date provide Parent a list of
Excluded Parties (as defined in the Merger Agreement), including the identity of each Excluded Party and a copy of
the Acquisition Proposal and any related documents (provided that any fee letters that are customarily redacted with
respect thereto may be redacted) submitted by such person and the basis on which the Board of Directors made the
determination that such Excluded Party is an Excluded Party. At any time after the Go-Shop Period End Date and until
the date which is five days after the Go-Shop Period End Date (the “Cut-off Date”), Natus may continue to engage in
the activities described in this section, and the restrictions below shall not apply to, any Excluded Party and its
Representatives (but only for so long as such person or group is an Excluded Party), including with respect to any
amended or modified Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the Go-Shop Period End Date.
Non-Solicitation After Go-Shop Period
Except as it relates to an Excluded Party (but only for so long as such person or group is an Excluded Party) and its
Representatives until the Cut-Off Date, Natus has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives not to:
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage,
facilitate or assist any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal;
83TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
participate, engage in discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information to, any
person relating to an Acquisition Proposal;
•
furnish to any person (other than to Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) any
non-public information relating to Natus or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any person access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Natus
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub), in any
such case with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to encourage, facilitate
or assist, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal;
•
approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal;
•
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, Merger Agreement, acquisition agreement or
other contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than certain permitted confidentiality
agreements; or
•
waive the applicability of all or any portion of any anti-takeover Laws (as such term is defined in the
Merger Agreement) in respect of any person (other than Parent and its Affiliates).
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, under certain circumstances, prior to the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by stockholders, Natus may, among other things, provide information to, and engage or participate in
negotiations or substantive discussions with, a person in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, and otherwise facilitate
such Acquisition Proposal or assist such person (and its Representatives and financing sources) with such
Acquisition Proposal (in each case, if requested by such person and such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in
breach of Natus’ obligations, as described in the immediately preceding paragraph) if (and only if):
•
such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger
Agreement;
•
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; and
•
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take the actions described above would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under the DGCL.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned, “-Termination of the Merger
Agreement; Termination Fees.”
Natus is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a
Superior Proposal, unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to,
negotiating with Parent in good faith over a four Business Day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes “Superior Proposal” relative to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such negotiations.
Natus is also required to provide or make available to Parent any information provided in connection with the receipt
of the Superior Proposal described above, to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or
made available to Parent, prior to or concurrently with the time such information is provided or made available to a
third party (or its representatives or financing sources).
In addition to any obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement with regard to the non-solicitation provisions of the
Merger Agreement, Natus has agreed to promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, notify Parent if any
Acquisition Proposal is received by, any non-public information for the purpose of making an Acquisition Proposal is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or, to the Knowledge (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Company, any of
its Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons making such offers
or proposals and (ii) if there are no material documents for
84
TABLE OF CONTENTS
such Acquisition Proposal, a reasonably detailed summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and (iii)
copies of all material documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal (including any related financing commitments)
(provided that any fee letters that are customarily redacted with respect thereto may be redacted). Thereafter, the
Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such
offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.
Change in the Recommendation of Natus’ Board of Directors
As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the
recommendation that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors will not effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change except as described below.
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, the Board of Directors may not take any action
described in the following (any such action, a “Company Board Recommendation Change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify, the Natus recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect;
•
adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the Natus recommendation following the public disclosure of an Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer, which shall be governed by
the immediately following clause) within five Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (it being
understood that Natus will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than three separate
occasions);
•
take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look
and listen” communication by the Board of Directors to Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood
that the Board of Directors may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until
the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of the Merger
Agreement); or
•
fail to include the Natus recommendation in this proxy statement.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders,
the Board of Directors may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if (1) there has been an Intervening
Event (as defined below); or (2) Natus has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior
Proposal, in each case, to the extent a failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would be
reasonably be excepted to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary obligations under applicable law.
The Board of Directors may only effect a Board of Directors Recommendation Change for an Intervening Event if:
•
Natus has provided prior written notice to Parent at least 4 Business Days in advance to the effect that the
Board of Directors has (1) so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which notice must describe the applicable Intervening Event in
reasonable detail; and
•
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, Natus and its Representatives, during
such four Business Day period, must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to
the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement (which, if accepted by the Company would be binding on Parent and Merger Sub) so
that the Board of Directors no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations pursuant to applicable law.
85
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, the Board of Directors may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to a bona
fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if:
•
the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
•
such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in material breach of the Merger Agreement;
•
Natus has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in advance to the effect that
the Board of Directors has (1) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2)
concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (3) resolved
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate the Merger Agreement absent any
revision to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which notice will describe the basis for such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination in reasonable detail, including consideration
relating thereto and the identity of the person of “group” of persons making such Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms thereof and copies of all material documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal
(including those relating to the source of financing therefor) (provided that any fee letters that are
customarily redacted with respect thereto may be redacted);
•
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, Natus and its
Representatives, during the four Business Day notice period describe above, has negotiated with Parent
and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (which, if accepted by the Company
would be binding on Parent and Merger Sub) so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that in the event of any material revisions to such Acquisition
Proposal, the Company will be required to provide Parent with new written notice (but the four Business
Day period shall instead be a two Business Day period) and otherwise comply with the requirements
described above;
•
in the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause or permit Natus or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, Natus has
validly terminated the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, including
paying to Parent a termination fee of $39,507,352 ($19,753,676 if in connection with entry into a definitive
agreement with a person or group that is an Excluded Party at the time of the termination); and
•
Natus has otherwise complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the Merger
Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.
For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any material effect,
event, development, occurrence or change in circumstances with respect to the Company that (A) was not known to
the Company Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement (or if known to the Company Board as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, the consequences of such effect, event, development, occurrence, or change in circumstances
event were not reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement), and (B) does
not relate to any Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal; provided that “Intervening Event” shall exclude any event, change or development to the
extent (i) consisting of or resulting from a breach of the Merger Agreement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) relating to changes in the price of the shares of Company Common Stock, in and of itself (however,
the underlying reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event), (iii) relating to the fact that, in and of
itself, the Company exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates or expectations of the Company’s
revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period (provided, that the
underlying reasons for the Company exceeding such projections, estimates or expectations may constitute an
Intervening Event) or (iv) relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates, if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board Obligation to Call a Company Stockholder Meeting
Natus will, in coordination with Parent, (i) take all actions necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the
bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record date (and Natus will not change such record date without the
prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, condition or delayed), (ii) duly call
and give notice of, the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practical following the signing of
the Merger Agreement, and (iii) convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Natus will not be required to convene and hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting at any time prior to the 20th Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company
Stockholders. Unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, Natus will use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, nothing will prevent Natus from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
if (i) there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by
proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum or to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval
at the Company Stockholder Meeting (provided that, without Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
more than two times pursuant to this clause (i) and no such postponement or adjournment shall be, without the prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Parent, for a period exceeding 15
Business Days); (ii) Natus is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law,
order or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (iii) the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties not to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to give the Company
Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that Natus has sent to the Company
Stockholders or otherwise made publicly available to the Company Stockholders (including in connection with a
Company Board Recommendation Change). Unless the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
its terms, Natus will submit the adoption of the Merger Agreement to its stockholders at the Company Stockholder
Meeting even if the Board of Directors shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change. Without the
prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of the
Merger Agreement will be the only matter (other than voting on a proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting and related procedural matters, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the
Exchange Act) that the Company will propose to be acted on by the Company’s stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. For more information, please refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned “-
Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees.”
Access to Information; Confidentiality
At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, subject to certain express
exceptions, Natus will afford Parent and its Representatives and the Financing Sources and their respective
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice to the properties,
books and records and personnel of Natus and solely for the purposes of furthering the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or integration planning related thereto, except that Natus may
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that it determines in good faith
that (a) any applicable law (including COVID-19 measures) or regulation requires Natus to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) such access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the
Company; (c) access to such documents or information would give rise to a waiver of any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information; (d) access to a contract to
which Natus or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or
give a third person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such contract; (e) access would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of third persons; (f) such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to
any adverse Legal Proceeding between Natus, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand; or
(g) such access would, in light of COVID-19 or COVID-19 measures, jeopardize the health and safety of any officer or
employee of the Company; or (h) such documents or information concern Acquisition Proposals or Acquisition

that Natus will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate on utilizing an alternative method of production of all such
information in the event any of the foregoing circumstances apply.
Required Efforts to Consummate the Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and Natus, on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts (x) to take (or cause to be taken)
all actions; (y) do (or cause to be done) all things; and (z) assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing (or
causing to be done) all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable Law or

Anti-Takeover Statutes
Each of Natus, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective authorized representatives will take all necessary actions
so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable “anti-takeover” law will not be applicable to the Merger.
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance
From and after the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by DGCL or pursuant to any and all provisions of any certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
similar organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries and any indemnification agreements with Natus
and any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of April 17, 2022, each current or former director and officer of Natus
(and any person who becomes a director or officer of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time)
(“Indemnified Person”) from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such
Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, with respect to any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
Merger Agreement or the Merger).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the
Subsidiaries of Natus, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger Agreement that have been made available to Parent.
During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
except as required by applicable law.
The Merger Agreement also provides during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, “D&O
Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect
to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are substantially equivalent to those of the D&O
Insurance, provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer (of the same
or better credit worthiness and financial capability) of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured thereunder. The Surviving Corporation will not be obligated
to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the annual premium amount paid by Natus for coverage for its last full
fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective
Time, Natus may (and if the Company is unable to purchase such a policy prior to Closing, Parent will) purchase a
prepaid six-year “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as Natus’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such
“tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If Natus (or Parent) purchases such a “tail” policy prior
to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such “tail”
policy is in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time. For more information,
please refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger-Interests of Natus’ Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger.”
Employee Benefits
The Merger Agreement provides that during the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on (x)
December 31, 2022, if the Effective Time occurs on or before September 30, 2022 or (y) if the Effective Time occurs on
or after October 1, 2022, June 30, 2023 (or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the relevant employee), the
Surviving Corporation will provide to each continuing employee: (i) a base salary or wage rate and short-term cash
incentive compensation opportunity that, in each case, is no less favorable than that provided to the continuing
employee immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) employee benefits (excluding severance, nonqualified deferred
compensation, defined benefit pension, retiree welfare benefits, employee stock purchase plan benefits, and equity or
equity-based compensation), that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to the continuing
employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those
provided to such continuing employee immediately before the Effective Time pursuant to the Company’s severance
plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement (and that are disclosed pursuant to
the Merger Agreement).
In addition, the Surviving Company will (and Parent will use reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted credit for each continued employee’s service with Natus prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement. Further, each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
the extent that coverage under such plan replaces in the plan year in which the closing occurs, coverage pursuant to
a comparable benefit plan sponsored by Natus and to the extent that the applicable waiting period under the Natus
plan has been satisfied or waived at or before the Effective Time.
89
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Further, with regard to any Surviving Corporation plans providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits,
any pre-existing conditions or exclusions, eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, and
actively at work or similar requirements will be waived with respect to the continuing employees and their covered
dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the applicable continuing employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and the continuing employee will be given full credit pursuant to
such Surviving Corporation plan for purposes of satisfying deductible, coinsurance, and maximum out of pocket
requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the plan year in which
the closing occurs as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the applicable Surviving Corporation plan.
Any accrued but unused vacation or paid time as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to the
continuing employee.
Financing
Natus has agreed that it will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective representatives to, assist Parent in the arrangement of any third-party debt financing for the purpose of
financing aggregate portion of the Per Share Price, (the “Debt Financing”), subject to certain exceptions described
below. The receipt of such Debt Financing and any equity financing are not conditions to the Merger.
Such cooperation will include, without limitation, (A) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
road shows, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions (including the participation in such meetings,
presentations and due diligence sessions of Natus’ senior management); (B) providing timely assistance with the
preparation of materials for lender presentations, bank information memoranda, rating agency presentations and
similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing and otherwise cooperating with the marketing
efforts for any of the Debt Financing; (C) furnishing the report of Natus’ auditor on the most recent audited
consolidated financial statements of Natus and its Subsidiaries; (D) as promptly as reasonably practicable furnishing
Parent and its financing sources with (1) audited consolidated balance sheet, statement of cash flows and statement
of income (or operations) for Natus for the most recent fiscal year that is at least 90 days before the closing date, in
each case prepared in accordance with GAAP and (2) unaudited balance sheet and related statements of income (or
operations) and cash flows of Natus as of the end of each fiscal quarter (other than the fourth fiscal quarter of any
fiscal year) ended on or after the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to the foregoing clause (a) and
at least 60 days before the closing date, in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP; (E) assisting Parent in
connection with the preparation and registration of any guarantee, pledge and security documents, currency or
interest hedging arrangements and other definitive financing documents, instruments and certificates as may be
reasonably requested by Parent; and (F) delivering such other pertinent and customary information regarding Natus
and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent to the extent that such information is of the type and
form customarily included in a bank information memoranda.
However, nothing described in this section of the proxy statement will require cooperation to the extent it would,
among other things, (i) require Natus or its Subsidiaries to take any action that, in the good faith determination of
Natus, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Natus and its Subsidiaries, (ii) require Natus
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any document or instrument or take any action in pursuit thereof that is
effective prior to the Effective Time (other than the customary representation and authorization letters in connection
with any Debt Financing) or (iii) require Natus or its Subsidiaries to give any indemnities in connection with the Debt
Financing that are effective prior to the Effective Time.
In addition, Parent will promptly, upon request by Natus, reimburse Natus for all documented and reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Natus or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective representatives in connection with the Debt Financing, but only if such costs and expenses would have
been incurred by Natus or its Subsidiaries in the absence of the Debt Financing. Parent will also indemnify and hold
harmless Natus, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses (including documented and reasonable attorneys’ fees), interest, awards,
judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with their
cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to the Merger Agreement or the provision of information
utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent suffered or incurred as a direct result of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct in connection with the Merger Agreement by Natus, its

Subsidiaries or their respective representatives. Further, Parent and its subsidiaries will be permitted to disclose
information about Natus and its Subsidiaries as necessary and consistent with customary practices in connection
with the Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality arrangements in connection therewith.
Other Covenants

Natus, Parent and Merger Sub agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of the Merger
Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate
the Merger Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that, subject to the Merger Agreement, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of the Merger Agreement are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would
result from a breach of the Merger Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
have the right to an injunction or specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to cause
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger if and only if (1) all conditions in the Merger Agreement have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (provided such
conditions would be satisfied as of such date)) at the time when the Closing was required to have occurred pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, (2) the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has been funded in accordance with
the terms and conditions thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof at the Closing
if the Equity Financing is funded to fund the Merger at the Closing, and (3) the Company has irrevocably confirmed
in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded and Parent and Merger
Sub comply with their obligations hereunder, then the Company is ready, willing and able to, and will take such
actions as are within its control, to consummate the Closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Natus, Parent and Merger Sub agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER",108,110
NATUS MEDICAL INC_20220602_DEFM14A_20144466_4472051.Pdf,MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER,"MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to “U.S. Holders” and “Non-U.S.
Holders” (in each case, as defined below) of Company Common Stock. This discussion applies only to holders that
hold their Company Common Stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, or the “Code” (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not describe
all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of the holder’s particular circumstances or to
holders subject to special rules, such as:
•
Dealers or traders subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to Company Common
Stock;
•
Persons holding Company Common Stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion
transaction, integrated transaction or constructive sale transaction;
•
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•
Partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes;
•
Persons who acquired Company Common Stock through the exercise of employee stock options or
otherwise as compensation;
•
Certain financial institutions and insurance companies;
•
Regulated investment companies;
•
Real estate investment trusts;
•
Certain former citizens or residents of the United States;
•
Tax-exempt entities, including an “individual retirement account” or “Roth IRA;” or
•
Persons subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax.
If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Company Common Stock, the
U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the
partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Partnerships holding Company Common Stock and
partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger to them.
This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and temporary
Treasury regulations, all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax
considerations under state, local and foreign laws are not addressed.
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Company Common Stock that is:
•
A citizen or resident of the United States;
•
A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; or
•
An estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.
The exchange of Company Common Stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder whose shares of Company Common Stock are converted into the right to
receive cash in the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. Holder
paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Company Common Stock
(i.e., shares of Company Common Stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss generally
will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the shares of Company
100TABLE OF CONTENTS
Common Stock exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-
corporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations. Capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject
to a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax.
Non-U.S. Holders
A “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Company Common Stock that is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Payments made to a Non-U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
The gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in
the United States (and if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the Non-U.S.
Holder’s permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States);
•
The Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger and certain
other conditions are met; or
•
The Non-U.S. Holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than
5% of the Company Common Stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger, and
Natus is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or the period that the
Non-U.S. Holder held Company Common Stock.
A Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income
tax on any gain realized as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder. If such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation,
it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower
treaty rate). A Non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate
of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses
recognized in the same taxable year, even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States.
Natus believes that it is not, and has never been, a United States real property holding corporation.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock generally will be subject to information reporting
(unless the holder is an “exempt recipient”) and may also be subject to backup withholding. To avoid backup
withholding, U.S. Holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. Holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is
correct and such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding. A Non-U.S. Holder that provides the applicable
withholding agent with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, as appropriate, will
generally establish an exemption from backup withholding.
Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited
against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the Internal
Revenue Service.
You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your
particular circumstances as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or
under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax laws.

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future
meetings of stockholders of Natus. However, if the Merger is not completed, stockholders will continue to be entitled
to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
Natus will hold an annual meeting in 2023 only if the Merger has not already been completed. Under Rule 14a-8
promulgated under the Exchange Act, a stockholder who intends to present a proposal at our annual meeting in 2023,
if held, and who wishes the proposal to be included in our proxy statement for that meeting must submit the proposal
in writing to 3150 Pleasant View Road Middleton, WI 53562, Attention: Corporate Secretary, no later than December
29, 2022. The proposal and its proponent must satisfy all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8.
Our bylaws permit a stockholder or group of stockholders (up to 20) who have owned at least 3% of our outstanding
shares of common stock for at least three years to submit director nominees (up to the greater of two or 20% of the
total number of directors, as determined in accordance with our bylaws) for inclusion in our proxy statement if the
nominating stockholder(s) satisfies the requirements specified in our bylaws. With respect to stockholder nominees
for director election submitted for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting, if held, written notice
of nominations must be provided by the proponent stockholder(s) to Natus in accordance with our bylaws. The
notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, our Secretary between November 29, 2022 and December 29,
2022, which deadlines are based on the 150th and 120th day, respectively, before the one-year anniversary of the date
on which we first sent proxy materials for the 2022 annual meeting.
With respect to stockholder nominees for director election (other than nominees submitted for inclusion in our proxy
materials) and stockholder proposals for consideration at the 2023 annual meeting, if held, that are not submitted for
inclusion in our proxy materials under Rule 14a-8, written notice of any such nominations and proposals must be
provided by the proponent stockholder to Natus in accordance with our bylaws. The notice must be delivered to or
mailed and received at our principal executive offices not later than April 16, 2023, which deadline is based on the 60th
day before the date specified in our proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous year’s
annual meeting of stockholders.
In addition to the notice and information requirements contained in our bylaws, to comply with the universal proxy
rules, stockholders who, in connection with our 2023 annual meeting, if held, intend to solicit proxies in support of
director nominees other than Natus’ nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule
14a-19 no later than April 16, 2023.
Stockholders may contact the corporate secretary at our principal executive offices for a copy of the relevant bylaw
provisions regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals.

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery
requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same
address by delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This
process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders
and cost savings for companies.
Natus and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering proxy materials to multiple
stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the
affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding
materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your
consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate
proxy statement and annual report, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or Natus
if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request to Natus Medical Incorporated,
3150 Pleasant View Road, Middleton, WI 53562, Attn: Corporate Secretary, or calling 608-829-8500. Stockholders who
share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive
a single copy by notifying Natus at the telephone and address set forth in the prior sentence. In addition, Natus will
promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the

Board of Directors
Natus Medical Incorporated
3150 Pleasant View Road
Middleton, WI 53562
Members of the Board:
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (“Stifel” or “we”) has been advised that Natus Medical Incorporated (the
“Company”) is considering entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Prince
Parent Inc. (the “Parent”) and Prince Mergerco Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent (“Merger Sub”),
pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation, and each
issued and outstanding share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company (the “Shares”) (other
than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the
“Excluded Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest thereon (the “Merger
Consideration”), subject to adjustment and on terms and conditions more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement
(the “Merger”).
The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has requested Stifel’s opinion, as investment bankers, as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of this opinion, to the holders of Shares, other than Excluded
Shares, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement
(the “Opinion”).
In rendering our Opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
discussed the Merger and related matters with the Company’s management and counsel and reviewed the
financial terms of the Merger contained in a draft dated April 16, 2022 of the Merger Agreement (the “Draft
Merger Agreement”);
(ii)
reviewed the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company contained in its Annual Reports on
Form 10-K for the three years ended December 31, 2021;
(iii) reviewed and discussed with the Company’s management certain other publicly available information
concerning the Company;
(iv) reviewed and discussed with the Company’s management certain non-publicly available information
concerning the Company, including without limitation internal financial analyses, financial projections,
reports and other information prepared by its management, including without limitation the Company’s
strategic plan (the “Company Strategic Plan”), utilized by us pursuant to instructions from the Company,
and held discussions with the Company’s senior management regarding recent developments;
(v)
reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available information concerning the terms of selected merger and
acquisition transactions that we considered relevant to our analysis;
(vi) reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial and stock market data relating to selected public
companies that we deemed relevant to our analysis;
(vii) participated in certain discussions and negotiations between representatives of the Company and the
Parent;
(viii) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity of the equity securities of the Company;
(ix) reviewed and analyzed, based on the Company Strategic Plan, the cash flows generated by the Company to
determine the present value of those discounted cash flows;

(x)
considered the results of our efforts, at the direction of the Company, to solicit indications of interest from
selected third parties with respect to a merger or other transaction with the Company;
(xi) conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations and considered such other information
as we deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinion; and
(xii) taken into account our assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our experience
in other transactions, as well as our experience in securities valuations and our knowledge of the
Company’s industry generally.
In rendering our Opinion, we have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial and other information that was provided to Stifel by or on behalf of the Company,
or that was otherwise reviewed by Stifel, and have not assumed any responsibility for independently verifying any of
such information. With respect to the financial forecasts supplied to us by the Company (including without limitation
the financial forecasts contained in the Company Strategic Plan and the price to be received for certain assets (the
“Specified Assets”) assumed to be divested in the Company Strategic Plan), we have assumed, at the direction of the
Company, that they were reasonably prepared on the basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of the Company as to the future operating and financial performance of the Company
and that they provided a reasonable basis upon which we could form our opinion. Such forecasts and projections
were not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure. All such forecasted or projected financial information is
based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors
related to general economic and competitive conditions, including, without limitation, assumptions regarding the
widespread disruption, extraordinary uncertainty and unusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such
forecasted or projected financial information. Stifel has relied on this forecasted or projected information, including
without limitation estimates of the management of the Company of the price to be received for the Specified Assets,
without independent verification or analyses and does not in any respect assume any responsibility for the accuracy
or completeness thereof. Stifel expresses no opinion as to any such forecasted or projected information or any other
estimates or the assumptions on which they were made.
We also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, business or prospects of the Company since the date of the last financial information made available to
us. We did not make or obtain any independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the Company’s assets
or liabilities, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Estimates of values of companies and
assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be
sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, Stifel assumes no responsibility for their accuracy.
We have assumed that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the Draft Merger Agreement.
We have also assumed that the Merger will be consummated substantially on the terms and conditions described in
the Merger Agreement without any waiver of material terms or conditions by the Company or any other party and
without any anti-dilution or other adjustment to the Merger Consideration, and that obtaining any necessary
regulatory approvals or satisfying any other conditions for consummation of the Merger will not have an adverse
effect on the Company or the Merger. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a manner that
complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have further assumed
that the Company has relied upon the advice of its counsel, independent accountants and other advisors (other than
Stifel) as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to the Company, the
Merger and the Merger Agreement.

Our Opinion is limited to whether the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares), from a financial point of view, and does not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the Merger
including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any consequences of the Merger on the Company,
its stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects or implications of any voting, support, stockholder or
other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the Merger or
otherwise. Our Opinion also does not consider, address or include: (i) any other strategic alternatives currently (or
which have been or may be) contemplated by the Board or the Company; (ii) the legal, financial reporting, tax,
accounting or regulatory consequences of the Merger on the Company or the holders of Shares; (iii) the fairness of
the amount or nature of any compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or class of such
persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of the Company’s securities or otherwise; (iv) the effect of the
Merger on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class of securities of the Company
other than the Shares, or any class of securities of any other party to any transaction contemplated by the Merger
Agreement; (v) whether the Parent has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it
to pay the Merger Consideration to the holders of Shares at the closing of the Merger; or (vi) the treatment of, or
effect of the Merger on, Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Options (each as
defined in the Merger Agreement). Furthermore, we are not expressing any opinion herein as to the prices, trading
range or volume at which the Company’s securities will trade following public announcement of the Merger.
Our Opinion is necessarily based on economic, market, financial and other conditions as they exist, and on the
information made available to us by or on behalf of the Company or its advisors, or information otherwise reviewed
by Stifel, as of the date of this Opinion. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion
reached in this Opinion and that Stifel does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this Opinion.
Further, as the Board is aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and
we express no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on the Company, the Parent or the Merger.
Our Opinion is for the information of, and directed to, the Board for its information and assistance in connection with
its consideration of the financial terms of the Merger. Our Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the
Board as to how the Board should vote or otherwise act on the Merger or any other matter or to any shareholder of
the Company as to how any such shareholder should act with respect to the Merger or any other matter, including
without limitation how to vote at any shareholders’ meeting at which the Merger is considered, or whether or not to
enter into a voting, shareholders’, or affiliates’ agreement with respect to the Merger, or exercise any dissenters’ or
appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder. In addition, the Opinion does not compare the relative
merits of the Merger with any other alternative transactions or business strategies which may have been available to
the Company and does not address the underlying business decision of the Board or the Company to proceed with
or effect the Merger.
We are not legal, tax, regulatory or bankruptcy advisors. We have not considered any potential legislative or
regulatory changes currently being considered or recently enacted by the United States Congress, the various
federal banking agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), or any other regulatory bodies, or
any changes in accounting methods or generally accepted accounting principles that may be adopted by the SEC or
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or any changes in regulatory accounting principles that may be adopted
by any or all of the federal banking agencies. Our Opinion is not a solvency opinion and does not in any way address
the solvency or financial condition of the Company or the Parent or any other party.
Stifel, as part of its investment banking services, is regularly engaged in the independent valuation of businesses and
securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, underwritings, sales and distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. We have acted as financial
advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of
which is contingent upon the completion of the Merger (the “Advisory Fee”). We have also acted as financial
advisor to the Board and will receive a fee upon the delivery of this Opinion that is not contingent upon
consummation of the Merger (the “Opinion Fee”), provided that such Opinion Fee is creditable against any Advisory
Fee. We will not receive any other significant payment or compensation contingent upon the successful
consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. There are no material relationships that existed during the two years prior to the date of this
B-3

Opinion or that are mutually understood to be contemplated in which any compensation was received or is intended
to be received as a result of the relationship between Stifel and any party to the Merger. Stifel may seek to provide
investment banking services to the Parent or its affiliates in the future, for which we would seek customary
compensation. In the ordinary course of business, Stifel and our clients may transact in the equity securities of the
Company and the Parent or its affiliates and may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.
Stifel’s Fairness Opinion Committee has approved the issuance of this Opinion. Our Opinion may not be published or
otherwise used or referred to, nor shall any public reference to Stifel be made, without our prior written consent,
except in accordance with the terms and conditions of Stifel’s engagement letter agreement with the Company.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration
to be received by holders of Shares, other than Excluded Shares, in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement is
fair to such holders of Shares, from a financial point of view.
Very truly yours,

Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced
such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section ​2.9(c) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or

Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent
agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment
Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (i) for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section ​2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of
Company Common Stock have become entitled pursuant to Section ​2.7, and (ii) for payment to the holders of

to Non-Employee Holders pursuant to Section 2.8(a), Section 2.8(b) and/or Section 2.8(c); or (3) all or any portion of
the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash
amounts owed pursuant to Section ​2.7 and/or the cash amounts owed to Non-Employee Holders pursuant to Section
2.8(a), Section 2.8(b) and/or Section 2.8(c) for any reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to,

is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the
payments owed pursuant to Section ​2.7 and the payments amounts owed to Non-Employee Holders pursuant to
Section 2.8(a), Section 2.8(b) and/or Section 2.8(c). Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be

(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days),
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (1) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares, Owned
Company Shares and shares of Company Restricted Stock) (the “Certificates”); and (2) uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Company Shares, Owned Company Shares and shares of Company Restricted Stock) (the “Uncertificated Shares”)
(A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section ​2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in
accordance with the provisions of Section ​2.11), the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding
Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an
“agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(I) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred
Uncertificated Shares; by (II) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof),
and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such
Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share
Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section ​2.9(c). Until
so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to
evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section ​2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be
required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the
payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section ​2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with
the Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that the Payment Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, equal to (x)(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned
Company Shares, Company Restricted Stock and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such
nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price plus (y) the aggregate amount in
cash owed to Non-Employee Holders pursuant to Section 2.8(a), Section 2.8(b) and Section 2.8(c).
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or

TABLE OF CONTENTS
ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if
such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid
or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only
be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.
(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section ​2.9
will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to Section ​2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares two years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.",141,143

have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance
with Section ​2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section ​2.7(c). The Per Share
Price paid in accordance with the terms of this ​Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will

discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged

otherwise provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives, to any Person given such access

Acquisition Proposal; (2) furnish to any Person (other than to Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or

Proposal; (5) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement

Acquisition Agreement”); (6) waive the applicability of all or any portion of any anti-takeover Laws in respect of any
Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates); or (7) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions. From the Go-
Shop Period End Date until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ​Article VIII and the
Effective Time, the Company will be required to enforce, and will not be permitted to waive, terminate or modify, any
provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement (except to the extent any “fall-away” or similar provision
contained in such standstill or confidentiality agreement would cause such failure to enforce, waiver, termination or
modification to occur as a result of the Company entering into this Agreement in and of itself) that prohibits or
purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof) (unless the Company
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in which case the Company
may fail to enforce, waive, terminate or modify such standstill or confidentiality agreement). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company agrees: (x) that any action taken by any director of the Company, any executive officer of the
Company or any financial or legal advisor of the Company (in their capacity as such) that, if taken by the Company
would constitute a breach of any provision set forth in this Section ​5.3(b) shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section ​5.3(b) by the Company; and (y) if the Company becomes aware of an action by any Representative of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary not described in prior clause (x), that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of any provision set forth in this Section ​5.3(b) and the Company does not promptly use its
reasonable best efforts to prohibit or terminate such action, then such action shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section ​5.3(b) by the Company.
(c) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section ​5.3, except for actions
permitted under Section ​5.3(a) as may relate to any Excluded Party (but only for so long as such Person or group of
Persons is an Excluded Party) and its Representatives which actions permitted under Section ​5.3(a) shall be

Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their

public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any Person or its Representatives that has
made or delivered to the Company a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that has
not been withdrawn, or otherwise facilitate or assist such Acquisition Proposal or assist such Person (and its
Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal (in each case, if requested by such Person),
in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in material breach of Section ​5.3(b);
provided, however, that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated by
this Section ​5.3(c) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable
Law; and provided further, however, that the Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) make
available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
such Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent.
(d) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Except
as provided by Section ​5.3(e), at no time after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board:
  (i) (1) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify
or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect; (2) adopt,
approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal; (3) fail to publicly reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation following the public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer, which shall be governed by clause (4)) within five Business
Days after Parent so requests in writing (it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such
reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions); (4) take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make
any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation
against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until
the close of business on the 10th Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection
with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this Section ​5.3); or (5) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (1) through (5),
a “Company Board Recommendation Change”); provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (A) the
determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal or (B) the delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section ​5.3(e) will, in
and of itself, constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section ​5.3; or
  (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(e) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:
  (i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, is governed exclusively by clause (ii) below), the Company Board may effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change in response to any material effect, event, development, occurrence or change in
circumstances with respect to the Company that (A) was not known to the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement (or if known to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, the consequences of such effect,
event, development, occurrence, or change in circumstances event were not reasonably foreseeable by, the Company
Board as of the date of this Agreement), and (B) does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (each such event, an “Intervening
Event”); provided that “Intervening Event” shall exclude any event, change or development to the extent (i)
consisting of or resulting from a breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) relating to
changes in the price of the shares of Company Common Stock, in and of itself (however, the underlying reasons for
such changes may constitute an Intervening Event), (iii) relating to the fact that, in and of itself, the
A-46
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Company exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates or expectations of the Company’s revenue,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period (provided, that the underlying reasons
for the Company exceeding such projections, estimates or expectations may constitute an Intervening Event) or (iv)
relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law and if and only if:
    (1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in advance to the
effect that the Company Board has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change pursuant to this Section ​5.3(e)(i), which notice will describe the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable
detail; and
    (2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, during such four Business Day period, must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in
good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (which, if accepted by the Company would be binding on Parent and Merger Sub) so that the
Company Board no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law; or
  (ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board may (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; or (y) authorize and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in each case, if and only if:
    (1) in the case of a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
    (2) such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in material breach of Section ​5.3(b);
    (3) (A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in advance
(the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board has (I) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that has
not been withdrawn; (II) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;
and (III) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section ​5.3(e)(ii) absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will describe
the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination in reasonable detail, including
consideration relating thereto and the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of the current drafts of all material documents relating to such
Acquisition Proposal (including those relating to the sources of financing therefor)(provided that any fee letters that
are customarily redacted with respect thereto may be redacted); and (B) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (which, if accepted by the Company would be
binding on Parent and Merger Sub) so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that in the event of any material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section ​5.3(e)(ii)(3) with
respect to such new written notice (it being understood that the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written
notice will be two Business Days); and
    (4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section ​8.1(h), including paying the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section ​8.3(b)(iii).

Company to make the inquiry (i.e., the “broker search”) required by Rule 14a-13(a)(1) under the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company will, in
coordination with Parent, take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the
rules of NASDAQ to (i) establish a record date for (and the Company shall not change such record date without the
prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) duly call

reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.
(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,

Meeting by applicable law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff or (iii) the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties not to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to give the
Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the
Company Stockholders or otherwise made publicly available to the Company Stockholders (including in connection
with a Company Board Recommendation Change). Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section ​8.1, the Company shall submit the adoption of this Agreement to its stockholders at the Company
Stockholder Meeting even if the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

meeting matters) that the Company will propose to be acted on by the Company’s stockholders at the Company

(a) No Amendments to Commitment Letters. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, or any termination or replacement of, any Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter if such
amendment, modification, waiver, termination or replacement would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing below the Required Financing Amount; (ii) impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of the Financing or otherwise expand, adversely amend or adversely modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing; (iii) materially delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (iv) materially and
adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the
Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter or the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to enforce their rights under

implement or exercise any of the “market flex” provisions exercised by the Financing Sources in accordance with the
Debt Commitment Letter and (y) add additional Financing Sources (including in replacement of a Financing Source)
of comparable creditworthiness to the Debt Commitment Letter (or all or a portion of the commitments may be
assigned to new or existing Financing Sources of comparable creditworthiness) and reallocate commitments or assign
or re-assign titles and roles to or among parties to the Debt Commitment Letter). Within two Business Days of receipt,
Parent and Merger Sub will provide the Company with copies of any amendment, modification, waiver, termination or
replacement of any Commitment Letter or Fee Letter made in accordance with this Section ​6.5(a). In the event that any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than a breach by the Company of this Agreement which prevents the Closing) Parent will
use its reasonable best efforts to (A) arrange alternative debt financing (the “Alternative Debt Financing”) from the
same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to pay the Required Financing Amount on terms and conditions
taken as a whole (including any “market flex” provisions in the Fee Letter), that are not less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub in the good faith determination of Parent and (B) to obtain one or more new financing commitment letters
with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing and Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of such
new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing (and any fee letter in connection
therewith; provided, such fee letter may be redacted in a customary manner to omit the fee amounts, original issue
discount, pricing caps and other economic terms and the “market flex” provisions thereof, none of which would
adversely affect the conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby or reduce the amount
of the Debt Financing to be less than the Required Financing Amount); provided that in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to pay any fees, taken as a whole, in
excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof (after
giving effect to the operation of any “market flex” or similar provisions). Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the
“Financing” will include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as amended, modified, waived or
replaced, and any Alternative Debt Financing obtained, in compliance with this Section ​6.5 and (2) the “Commitment
Letters” and the “Fee Letter” will include such documents as amended, modified, waived or replaced, or any
Alternative Debt Financing obtained, in compliance with this Section ​6.5. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing, including promptly notifying the Company of the receipt
by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or other written communication from any Financing Source with
A-51

respect to any (i) breach or default which would permit any party to a Commitment Letter to terminate or modify its
obligations thereunder, (ii) termination or repudiation by any party to a Commitment Letter or (iii) material dispute or
disagreement among the parties to any Commitment Letter.
(b) Taking of Necessary Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger
Sub will use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters
and the Fee Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof until the initial funding of the Financing; (ii)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions as specified in the Debt
Commitment Letters and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding the Financing that are applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter; (iii) if all of the conditions to the Financing and in
​Article VII of this Agreement have been satisfied or waived, consummate the Financing to the extent necessary to
consummate the Merger at Closing; and (iv) comply with its obligations pursuant to, and enforce, the Commitment
Letters.
(c) Enforcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Section ​6.5 will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to other than with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing, seek
the Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the
Commitment Letters or to litigate against any Financing Sources or Financing Source Related Parties.
(d) No Financing Condition. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is
not a condition to the Closing. If the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to
be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ​Article VII, to consummate the Merger
at the time contemplated by Section ​2.3.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that a breach of a covenant in this
Section ​6.5 shall not result in the failure of a condition precedent to its obligations under this Agreement if
(notwithstanding such breach) Parent is willing and able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the date the Closing is to occur pursuant to Section ​2.3.

failure to comply (i) that is the primary cause of Parent’s failure to obtain the Debt Financing and (ii) in respect of

(a) Indemnified Persons. From and after the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any and all provisions of any certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other similar
organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries and any indemnification agreements between the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any
Person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time),
(collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) for any acts or omissions by such Indemnified Persons occurring prior to
the Effective Time. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement that
have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section ​6.10(a), during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
A-55TABLE OF CONTENTS
extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly,
out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such
Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the
Effective Time; and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect
thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to
have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent), except that if, at any time prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim
for indemnification pursuant to this Section ​6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal
Proceeding, (1) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (2) the Surviving Corporation will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any
counsel in the event that (A) the employment of separate counsel has been previously authorized by the Company,
(B) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the
Company and the Indemnified Person in the conduct of any such defense or (C) the Company shall fail to maintain
counsel to defend any such Legal Proceeding) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal
Proceeding within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by the Surviving Corporation of a written request for
such advancement, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal
Proceeding; and (3) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without
his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving
Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability
arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of
any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified
Person). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of advancement of expenses in connection with the foregoing,
any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced must, as a condition to such advancement, (x) provide an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in a final non-appealable judgment that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification; and (y) cooperate in the defense of any such matter until it is
determined that such Indemnified Person is not eligible for indemnification in a final non-appealable judgment.
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, “D&O
Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with
respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are substantially equivalent to those of the D&O
Insurance; provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer (of the same
or better credit worthiness and financial capability) of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured thereunder. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this
Section ​6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
annual premium amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the
“Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
(and if the Company is unable to purchase such a policy prior to Closing, Parent shall) purchase a prepaid six-year
“tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail”
policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company (or Parent)
A-56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
purchases such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder for so long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the
Effective Time.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
will (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then
proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this Section ​6.10.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section ​6.10 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person. Each of the Indemnified Persons are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
Section ​6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this
Section ​6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant
to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any
and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity).
(f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section ​6.10 will be joint and several.
(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any
rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification
agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section ​6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “Corporate Transaction,” “change of
control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Employee Plans will occur as of the Effective Time.
(b) Existing Arrangements. Nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates from in any way
amending, modifying or terminating any Employee Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance
with their terms or if required pursuant to applicable Law.
(c) Employment; Benefits. During the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on (x) December 31,
2022, if the Effective Time occurs on or before September 30, 2022 or (y) if the Effective Time occurs on or after
October 1, 2022, June 30, 2023 (or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the relevant Continuing Employee), the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to) provide to each Continuing Employee: (i) a base salary or wage rate and short-term cash incentive compensation
opportunity that, in each case, is no less favorable than that provided to the Continuing Employee immediately
before the Effective Time, (ii) employee benefits (excluding severance, nonqualified deferred compensation, defined
benefit pension, retiree welfare benefits, employee stock purchase plan benefits, and equity or equity-based
compensation), that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time pursuant to the Company’s severance plans,
guidelines and practices as in effect on the date of this Agreement and that are disclosed on Section 3.18(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.
(d) New Plans. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to each Continuing Employee credit for
all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement under the employee benefit plans of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (other than equity-based plans, the “New Plans”) in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate following the Effective Time, to the same extent such service was recognized under the corresponding
Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time, except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or compensation or benefits or for any purpose under any equity-based incentive
A-57TABLE OF CONTENTS
plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage
pursuant to any such New Plan replaces in the plan year in which the Closing occurs coverage pursuant to a
comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time
comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, the “Old Plans”) and to the extent that the applicable waiting period under the Old Plan had been
satisfied or waived at or before the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee in the plan year in which the Closing occurs, Parent
will cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-
work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the same extent such waiting periods, exclusions, and requirements were waived under the
corresponding Old Plan, and Parent will cause, for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan in which the Effective Time occurs and ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents for the plan year in which the Closing occurs as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and
will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture (except to the extent that such limits or forfeitures applied under
the Employee Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement).
(e) Notices, Consultations and Consents. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
provide any required notices to, consult with (if required), and obtain any required consents from, any labor, trade
union or employee representative body of employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company’s obligations contemplated by
this Section 6.11 shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VII have been satisfied unless such breach has been willful.
(f) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. This Section ​6.11 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment or service
for any period of time for any Continuing Employee or any other Person, or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment or service of any
Continuing Employee or any other Person at any time and for any or no reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any New Plan, Old Plan, Employee Plan or any other
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any

upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. Although the Company and Parent may each pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary
damages (including the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee, as applicable), under no

provisions of Section ​8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will
not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and
without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is
A-69TABLE OF CONTENTS

Financing to be funded and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger if and only if (1) all
conditions in Section ​7.1 and Section ​7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to
be satisfied at the Closing (provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)) at the time when the
Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to Section ​2.3, (2) the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing)
has been funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded to fund the Merger at the Closing, and (3) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing is funded and Parent and Merger Sub comply with their obligations hereunder, then the Company is ready,
willing and able to, and will take such actions as are within its control, to consummate the Closing pursuant to ​Article
II.

injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this
